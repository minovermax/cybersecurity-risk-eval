{"cik": "921738", "company": "PENN NATIONAL GAMING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; internet gaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Pennsylvania and Louisiana; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; the potential for increased fantasy sports; real money iGaming; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, fantasy sports, and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. Even internet wagering services that are illegal under federal and state law but operate from overseas locations, may nevertheless sometimes be accessible to domestic gamblers and divert customers from our properties. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker and other varieties of internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, such as Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate internet gaming and internet gaming operations have begun in these states. In addition, Pennsylvania enacted legislation allowing regulated online poker and casino-style games within the state. Further, there has been recent expansion of sports betting in various states (such as New Jersey, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) as states have passed legislation legalizing sports betting in casinos. Expansion of internet gaming in other jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operations.\nIn a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts; and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations (including VGTs, sports betting and iGaming). Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe face intense competition in the markets in which we operate.\nGaming competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. Recently, there has been additional significant competition in our markets as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes. As competing properties and new markets are opened, our operating results may be negatively impacted. For example, new casinos and racinos have opened that compete in the same market as our Lawrenceburg property, namely the opening of Belterra Park in May 2014, our own Dayton facility in August 2014, and Horseshoe Casino in Cincinnati in March 2013; there is significantly increased competition to our Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races property from the casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland, the opening of Maryland Live! and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland in 2014 and the opening of MGM National Harbor casino in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland in December 2016, which also competes to a lesser extent with Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course; the opening of our joint venture casino project in Kansas in February 2012, which impacted Argosy Casino Riverside; and the potential opening of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts (the construction is currently on hold following a judicial ruling in favor of the Taunton property owners who contended that the federal government erred in placing reservation land in trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe); the recent opening of a tribal casino in Nebraska in November 2018, which competes with Ameristar Council Bluffs; the recent openings of MGM Springfield in Western Massachusetts in August 2018 and Tiverton Casino Hotel in Tiverton, Rhode Island, in September 2018, the expected opening of Wynn Everett in Eastern Massachusetts in mid-2019, and the new hotel tower at Twin River Casino Hotel in Lincoln, Rhode Island, which opened in the fourth quarter 2018; are anticipated to negatively impact our Plainridge Park Casino. Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, and Ameristar East Chicago have also been negatively impacted by the proliferation of VGTs at numerous locations throughout the state of Illinois, which are in the vicinity of our operations. In addition, some of our direct competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. Pennsylvania enacted legislation that will expand gaming in the state which will cause additional competition for Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course, and Meadows Racetrack and Casino. We expect each\nexisting or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in detail in Item 1. Business, \u201cCompetition,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently acquired, may develop or acquire in the future.\nWe expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new properties, which evaluations may include discussions and the review of confidential information after the execution of nondisclosure agreements with potential acquisition candidates, some of which may be potentially significant in relation to our size.\nWe could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets, such as the entry into the Michigan market with the pending acquisition of Greektown. The integration of more significant properties that we may develop or acquire (such as those acquired in the Pinnacle transaction as well as the Margaritaville Resort Casino and anticipated Greektown transactions) will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. In addition, development and integration of new information technology systems that may be required is costly and time-consuming. The process of integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In particular, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible.\nManagement of new properties, especially in new geographic areas and business lines may require that we increase our management resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or development projects. We also cannot assure you that if acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations.\nOur ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of some or all of the above described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete, or other delays or impediments to completing certain of our acquisitions.\nOur growth is fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming, racing, and development properties. In addition to standard closing conditions, our acquisitions are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such acquisitions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming facilities.\nNo assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded gaming facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. Delays in opening new or upgraded facilities could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as financing payments under the Leases, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flow from operations as rent pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of leases, including our three leases with GLPI and our lease for Margaritaville Resort Casino with VICI (collectively, the leases are referred to as the \u201cLeases\u201d). As a result of these commitments, our ability to fund our own\noperations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the Leases may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making lease payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with our landlords, GLPI and VICI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nWe lease 34 of the facilities we operate pursuant to the Leases. The Leases provide that our landlords, GLPI and VICI, may terminate each such Lease for a number of reasons, including, subject to applicable cure periods, the default in any payment of rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of any other covenant or agreement in the lease. Termination of any of our Leases could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Moreover, as a lessee we do not completely control the land and improvements underlying our operations and our landlords under the Leases could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the facilities leased under the Leases which are beyond our control. If one of our landlords chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations would be adversely affected. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our obligations under the Leases in the future. In addition, if one of our landlords has financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that the landlord will be able to comply with its obligations under its agreements with us.\nEach of our Leases is commonly known as a triple net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay among other things the following: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor) and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the landlords as owners of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Leases even if we decided to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn.\nOur net revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at properties we manage and as such our business has been adversely impacted by economic downturns. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, high fuel or other transportation costs and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming authorities.\nAs owners and managers of casino gaming, video lottery, and pari-mutuel wagering operations, we are subject to extensive state and local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable\nlegislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in us. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, for instance, hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming and pari-mutuel facilities. We can give no assurance to you that we will be able to retain those existing licenses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.\nChanges in legislation and regulation of our operations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRegulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nIn particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to internet gaming and sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in January 2019, legal counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) issued a legal opinion on the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 (\u201cWire Act\u201d), which stated that the Wire Act bans any form of online gambling if it crosses state lines and reversed a 2011 DOJ legal opinion that stated that it only applied to interstate sports betting.\nState and local smoking restrictions have negatively affected our business and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking restrictions have significantly impacted business volumes.\nIn August 2017, the East Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council approved a smoking ban in casinos and bars that took effect in June 2018. This smoking ban has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business at L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge, which we acquired as part of the Pinnacle transaction. We also face a partial smoking ban in St. Louis, Missouri, which could impact both our Hollywood Casino St. Louis and River City Casino properties. In January 2015, the New Orleans City Council unanimously approved an ordinance in the City of New Orleans that prohibits smoking in casinos, bars and restaurants. The Boomtown New Orleans facility is located in the City of Harvey and not in the City of New Orleans, so the smoking ban does not apply to that facility. However, if a smoking ban was approved in the City of Harvey, we believe that this will have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe passage of the Smoke Free Illinois Act which banned smoking in casinos, adversely affected revenues and operating results at our Illinois properties at the time it was implemented in January 2008. In Pennsylvania, we are currently permitted to allow smoking on only up to 50% of the gaming floor of our Grantville facility and smoking is banned in all other indoor areas. Additionally, in July 2012, a state statute in Indiana became effective that imposes a state wide smoking ban in specified businesses, buildings, public places and other specified locations. The statute specifically exempts riverboat casinos, and all other gaming facilities in Indiana, from the smoking ban. However, the statute allows local government to enact a more restrictive smoking ban than the state statute and also leaves in place any more restrictive local legislation that exists as of the effective date of the statute. To date, our facility in Lawrenceburg, Indiana is not subject to any such local legislation.\nOn November 6, 2018, voters in St. Louis County approved a ballot referendum that requires Hollywood Casino St. Louis and River City Casino to make at least 50% of their gaming floor smoke free. This smoking restriction could have an adverse impact on our business operations at our casinos in St. Louis County.\nIf additional smoking restrictions are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do business, our business could be adversely affected.\nMaterial increases to our taxes or the adoption of new taxes could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes, property taxes, and/or authorizing additional gaming facilities each subject to payment of a new license fee. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in such laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nWe are required to comply with extensive non-gaming laws and regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of our properties, employees or customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have certain properties that generate a significant percentage of our net revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 10.2% of our net revenues from our facility in Charles Town, West Virginia. Furthermore, with the acquisitions of Pinnacle and Margaritaville Resort Casino, for the year ending December 31, 2019, we anticipate a significant portion of our net revenues will be generated from our facilities in Louisiana, principally L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of our facilities in Louisiana and in West Virginia. The operations at the facilities in Louisiana and West Virginia and any of our other facilities could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d as well as more specifically those described below:\n\u2022\nrisks related to local and regional economic and competitive conditions, such as a decline in the number of visitors to a facility, a downturn in the overall economy in the market, a decrease in consumer spending on gaming activities in the market or an increase in competition within and outside the state in which each property is located;\n\u2022\nchanges in local and state governmental laws and regulations (including smoking restrictions and changes in laws and regulations affecting gaming operations and taxes) applicable to a facility;\n\u2022\nimpeded access to a facility due to weather, road construction or closures of primary access routes;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems as well as issues arising in connection with agreements with horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of natural disasters or other adverse regional weather trends.\nIn addition, although to a lesser extent than our facilities in Louisiana and West Virginia, we anticipate meaningful contributions from Ameristar Black Hawk, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and our properties in Missouri and Ohio. Therefore, our results will be dependent on the regional economies and competitive landscapes at these locations as well.\nWe may experience an impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recognized a substantial amount of goodwill in connection with consummation of the merger with Pinnacle and the allocation of the purchase price thereto. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing fair value estimates for goodwill since the results are based on estimated future cash flows and assumptions related thereto. Significant assumptions include estimates of future sales and expense trends, construction costs, discount rates, liquidity and capitalization, among other factors. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information, which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from those projections. Further, we may need to recognize an impairment of some of the goodwill recognized in the merger with Pinnacle or any other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business (particularly in the case of class actions). As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in these lawsuits, and, especially with increasing class action claims in our industry, could result in costs, settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel could significantly harm our business, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left our company.\nOur success and our competitive position are largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. Although we enter into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain employed by us. If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from numerous Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, we expect to have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at our corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInclement weather and other casualty events could seriously disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events. Because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land-based casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. Many of our casinos operate in areas which are subject to periodic flooding that has caused us to\nexperience decreased attendance and increased operating expenses. Any flood or other severe weather condition could lead to the loss of use of a casino facility for an extended period. For instance, Hollywood Casino Toledo was closed for brief periods in 2014, 2015 and 2016 due to harsh winter conditions and Argosy Casino Alton was closed for several days in December 2015, January 2016 and May 2017 due to flooding. In 2015, Boomtown Bossier City experienced flooding which resulted in temporary closure, repair and clean-up costs and lost business volume. In 2016, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge were both negatively impacted by lost business volume due to severe rain and flooding. In 2017, visitation to Boomtown New Orleans, L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles and L\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate.\nEven if adverse weather conditions do not require the closure of our facilities, those conditions make it more difficult for our customers to reach our properties for an extended period of time, which can have an adverse impact on our operations. Casualty events such as, the tragic shootings that occurred on the Las Vegas Strip on October 1, 2017 that affect tourism also impact our business. Following the October 2017 tragedy, operations at Tropicana Las Vegas were adversely effected.\nThe extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our properties in the event of future inclement weather and other casualty events could adversely affect our business.\nWe maintain significant property insurance, including business interruption coverage, for these and other properties. However, there can be no assurances that we will be fully or promptly compensated for losses at any of our facilities in the event of future inclement weather or casualty events. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding certain facilities \u201cas was\u201d if there was a total loss. The Leases require us, in the event of a casualty event, to rebuild a leased property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before such casualty event. We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder\u2019s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so material that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security systems and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate.\nAny unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, a failure of our information technology or related systems, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services to us (whether due to technological difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption at the casinos that we operate and have a material effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of employee information, customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems, including our own systems and those of service providers and third parties, to manage our business and employee data and maintain and transmit customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and we have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply by implementing processes designed to safeguard our business, employee and customers\u2019 confidential and personal information. In addition, our security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly. However, our information and processes and those of our service providers and other third parties, are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate the risks of breaches may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, disclosures, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nFurther, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability. Increased instances of cyber-attacks may also have a negative reputational impact on us and our properties that may result in a loss of customer confidence and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on management agreements and/or leases with third parties and local governments.\nOur operations in several jurisdictions depend on land leases and/or management and development agreements with third parties and local governments. If we, or if GLPI or VICI in the case of leases pursuant to which we are the sub-lessee, are unable to renew these leases and agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire or disputes arise regarding the terms of these agreements, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks\nThe Federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended, the West Virginia Race Horse Industry Reform Act and the Pennsylvania Racing Act require that, in order to simulcast races, we have certain agreements with the horse owners and trainers at our West Virginia and Pennsylvania racetracks. In addition, West Virginia requires applicants seeking to renew their gaming license to demonstrate they have an agreement regarding the proceeds of the gaming machines with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers, a representative of a majority of the pari-mutuel clerks and a representative of a majority of the horse breeders.\nAt Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, the Company has an agreement with the Charles Town Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association, which expired on June 18, 2018, but has been extended until April 18, 2019. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races also has an agreement with the breeders that expires on June 30, 2019. Additionally, the pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town are represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Union of Mutuel Clerks, which expired on December 31, 2010, but has been extended on a month-to-month basis.\nThe Company\u2019s agreement with the Pennsylvania Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course was renewed through January 31, 2020. The Company has an agreement with Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America Local 108, regarding both on-track and off-track pari-mutuel clerks and admission staff, which expires on December 1, 2021. The Company has an agreement, which runs through August 2021, with the International Chapter of Horseshoers and Allied Equine Trades Local 947 regarding starting gate and jockey valet staff.\nIn certain jurisdictions where we operate pari-mutuel wagering, if we fail to present evidence of an agreement with the horsemen at a track, we may not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and OTWs and, in West Virginia, our video lottery license may not be renewed. In addition, our annual simulcast export agreements are subject to the horsemen\u2019s approval under the Federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended. Some simulcast import agreements require horsemen approval depending on state law. If we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business.\nWe regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors, including, general economic conditions; changes to construction plans and specifications; delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; disputes with contractors; disruptions to our business caused by construction; and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\nWhile we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable, these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments, or any returns at all. A failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or an outright sale of the loan to a third party.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nA majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our customers.\nA substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector in recent years, including the\nacquisitions of Multimedia Games, Inc. by Global Cash Access, Bally Technologies, Inc. (which had acquired SHFL Entertainment, Inc.) and WMS Industries Inc. by Scientific Games Corporation and International Gaming Technologies by GTECH Holdings.\nIn recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.\nWe have announced several initiatives in the social gaming space, which is a new line of business for us in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that our new initiatives will be successful.\nWe have announced several initiatives in the social gaming space, including the 2016 acquisition of Rocket Speed, and expect to continue to invest in and market social gaming and other mobile gaming platforms to our customers in casinos and beyond and to explore other acquisitions in the space. Social gaming is a new line of business for us, which makes it difficult to assess its future prospects. Our products will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors, including Playtika, Zynga and slot manufacturers. Given the open nature of the development and distribution of games for electronic devices, our business will also compete with developers and distributors who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. We have limited experience operating in this rapidly evolving marketplace and may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, our ability to be successful with our social gaming platform is dependent on numerous factors beyond our control that affect the social and mobile gaming industry and the online gaming industry in the United States, including the occurrence and manner of legalization of online real money gaming in the United States beyond Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey; changes to the policies of social gaming distribution channels, including Apple and Google; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; changing laws and regulations affecting social and mobile games; the reaction of regulatory bodies to social gaming initiatives by holders of gaming licenses; the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; any challenges to the intellectual property rights underlying our games; any advances in technology that we are unable to implement timely; and outages and disruptions of our online services that may harm our business.\nOur social gaming initiatives will result in increased operating expense and increased time and attention from our management. In addition, we may be particularly dependent on key personnel in our interactive business unit. We believe our social games are complementary to our current operations and offer additional avenues of access and interaction for our customers, and, the social gaming business depends on developing and publishing games that consumers will download and spend time and money on consistently. We continue to invest in research and development, analytics and marketing to attract and retain customers for our social games. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games and other forms of entertainment, and the emergence of new platforms. Our inability to ultimately monetize our investment in social gaming initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have recently expanded our sports betting operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will be successful and generate sufficient returns on our investment.\nDuring the second quarter 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (\u201cPASPA\u201d) as unconstitutional. Prior to the Court\u2019s ruling, PASPA banned sports betting in most U.S. States. In light of the Court\u2019s ruling, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate legalized intra-state sports wagering and established extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements governing any such intra-state sports wagering, including the payment of license fees and additional taxes by operators. We began accepting wagers on sporting events during the third quarter 2018 at our casinos located in Mississippi, West Virginia, and during the fourth quarter at one of our casinos in Pennsylvania while we were already accepting wagers on sporting events in our casinos in Nevada. We continue to engage with state lawmakers in other jurisdictions in which we already operate to advocate for the passage of laws legalizing sports betting within the\njurisdiction with reasonable tax rates and license fees, similar to legislation enacted in West Virginia, Mississippi and Nevada. Any further expansion of our sports betting operations is dependent on potential legislation in these other jurisdictions.\nOur sports betting operations will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors. In order to compete successfully, we may need to enter into agreements with strategic partners and other third party vendors and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us. The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States; our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market; our ability to compete with new entrants in the market; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that our expansion will be successful and generate sufficient returns on our investment.\nOur internet gaming initiatives may result in increased risk of cyber-attack, hacking, or other security breaches, which could harm our reputation and competitive position and which could result in regulatory actions against us or in other penalties.\nAs our social gaming and real money iGaming business grows, we will face increased cyber risks and threats that seek to damage, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, and supporting infrastructure. Such cyber risks and threats, including to virtual currencies that may be used in the games, may be difficult to detect. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risk could result in interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, and cause our users to lose confidence in our products. The unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure of consumer information could compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and substantial legal and financial liability. Our key business partners also face these same risks with respect to consumer information they collect, and data security breaches with respect to such information could cause reputational harm to them and negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms. This could harm our business and reputation, disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position.\nThe success of our VGT operations in Illinois is dependent on our ability to renew our contracts and expand the business.\nOn September 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Prairie State Gaming, one of the largest VGT operators in Illinois and subsequently have completed several smaller acquisitions of VGT operators in the state. We face competition from other VGT operators, as well as from casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. Our ability to compete successfully in this new line of business depends on our ability to retain existing customers and secure new establishments, both of which are dependent on the level of service and variety of products that we are able to offer to our customers. VGT contracts are renewable at the option of the owner of the applicable bar and retail gaming establishments and, as our contracts expire, we will be subject to competition for renewals. In addition, VGT operations in Illinois are subject to approval by local municipalities, and therefore our ability to retain and expand our VGT business depends, in part, on such approvals. In addition, there is a risk that the market for VGTs in Illinois could become oversaturated. If we are unable to retain our existing customers or their results suffer as a result of competition or because the market becomes oversaturated or if certain municipalities in Illinois elect to prohibit VGTs, our business and operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe operate in a highly taxed industry and it may be subject to higher taxes in the future. If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we operate, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. We also pay property taxes, admission taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability depends on generating enough revenues to pay gaming taxes and other largely variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as rental payments to our landlords, property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases can significantly impact the profitability of gaming operations. For example, on October 30, 2017, Pennsylvania increased gaming taxes, which adversely impacted our casinos in Pennsylvania.\nWe cannot assure you that governments in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. Global economic pressures have reduced the revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nWork stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. From time to time, we have incurred and are incurring costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitively. To date, none of these matters have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. Under our contractual arrangements under the Leases, we will generally be responsible for both past and future environmental liabilities associated with our gaming operations, notwithstanding ownership of the underlying real property having been transferred. Furthermore, we are aware that there is or may have been soil or groundwater contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former operations. By way of further example, portions of Tropicana Las Vegas are known to contain asbestos as well as other environmental conditions, which may include the presence of mold. The environmental conditions may require remediation in isolated areas. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitely, and may result in additional expense in the event that additional or currently unknown conditions are detected.\nAdditionally, certain of the gaming chips used at many gaming properties, including some of ours, have been found to contain some level of lead. Analysis by third parties has indicated the normal handling of the chips does not create a health hazard. We have disposed of a majority of these gaming chips. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally, The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer processes. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nThe riverboats on which we operate must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. The casino barges on which we operate also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of the gaming facilities on which we operate were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, construction, land use, employment, marketing and advertising and the production, sale and service of alcoholic beverages. If\nwe are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions, also referred to herein as \u201cGHG\u201d continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate.\nWe may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and nongovernmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions and in the past federal legislation have been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. Further, regulation of GHG emissions may limit our guests\u2019 ability to travel to our facilities as a result of increased fuel costs or restrictions on transport related emissions. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We have described the risks to us associated with extreme weather events in the risk factors above.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nIf the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Section 355, and we received from our tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that, with respect to such requirements on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. The IRS Ruling, and the tax opinions that we received from our tax advisors, relied on and will rely on, among other things, certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of GLPI\u2019s business, and the IRS Ruling and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect.\nNotwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine the Spin-Off should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS Ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nIf the Spin-Off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the GLPI common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that GLPI entered into with us, GLPI generally is required to indemnify us against any tax resulting from the Spin-Off to the extent that such tax resulted from (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of GLPI, whether by merger or otherwise, (2) other actions or failures to act by GLPI, or (3) any of GLPI\u2019s representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated. GLPI\u2019s indemnification obligations to Penn and its subsidiaries, officers and directors will not be limited by any maximum amount. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn or such other persons under the circumstance set forth in the tax matters agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities and there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nOn September 27, 2017 the Internal Revenue Service finalized the audit examination of the 2013 U.S. federal income tax return with no adjustments related to the Spin-off including the tax-free treatment. Although the 2013 examination is finalized, the statute of limitation was extended to June 30, 2018.\nPeter M. Carlino, our Chairman, and David A. Handler, one of our directors, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at GLPI.\nPeter M. Carlino serves as our Chairman and as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI. In addition, David A. Handler, one of our directors, is also a director of GLPI. While we have procedures in place to address such situations, these overlapping positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or GLPI\u2019s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as greenfield development opportunities or potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and GLPI. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and GLPI (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and GLPI, such as under the Leases with GLPI. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and GLPI enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, GLPI agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that GLPI\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, GLPI has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that GLPI agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from GLPI any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from GLPI.\nA court could deem the distribution in the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us.\nIf the transaction is challenged by a third party, a court could deem the distribution of GLPI common shares or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our shareholders to return to us some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.\nIf we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, both we and GLPI could experience adverse tax consequences.\nIf we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, the IRS will be authorized to reallocate income and deductions between us and GLPI to reflect arm\u2019s length terms. If the IRS were to successfully establish that rents paid by us to GLPI are excessive, (1) we would be denied a deduction for the excessive portion and (2) we would be subject to a penalty on the portion deemed excessive, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, our shareholders would be deemed to have received a distribution that was then contributed to the capital of GLPI.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Pinnacle\nWe may be unable to integrate the business of Pinnacle into our business successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the Pinnacle transaction.\nWe entered into the merger agreement with Pinnacle with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits for the combined company, including, among others, synergies resulting from cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the respective businesses and assets of both companies can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Pinnacle with our operations. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine the business of Pinnacle with our business in a manner that permits the parties to achieve the full revenue, cost synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the transaction;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other\nassets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration of Pinnacle\u2019s business with our business.\nEven if we are able to integrate Pinnacle\u2019s businesses successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Pinnacle\u2019s businesses. While we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the transaction may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage the expanded operations following the transaction.\nThe size of the combined business is significantly larger than the size of either the Penn business or the Pinnacle business prior to the closing of the transaction. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the Pinnacle transaction.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had indebtedness of $2.45 billion, including $112.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $1.8 billion in outstanding term loans. In addition, we are required to make significant annual lease payments to GLPI which increased upon the closing of the Pinnacle Acquisition by approximately $355 million to approximately $817 million. Beginning January 1, 2019, we are required to make $23.2 million in initial annual lease payments to VICI pursuant to the Margaritaville Lease. Additionally, upon closing of the Greektown acquisition, we will pay VICI an initial annual rent amount of $55.6 million.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and a significant fixed annual lease payments under the Leases. Our substantial indebtedness and additional fixed costs under our Lease obligations could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to participate in multiple or large development projects, including mergers and acquisitions, absent additional third party financing;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to satisfy our financing obligation and debt service, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of\nour debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The terms of our debt do not, and any future debt may not, fully prohibit us from incurring additional debt, including debt related to facilities we develop or acquire. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nVolatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our revenues and our ability to access favorable financing terms.\nWhile we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, we may require additional financing to support our continued growth. However, depending on then current economic or capital market conditions, our access to capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further, if adverse regional and national economic conditions persist or worsen, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness. Finally, our borrowing costs under our senior secured credit facility are tied to LIBOR. We currently have no hedges in place to mitigate the impact of higher LIBOR rates and as such significant increases in LIBOR could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on business.\nWe intend to finance some of our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and equity or debt financings. We are required by the Leases to, in the case of certain expansion projects, or may choose, in the case of other development projects, provide GLPI or VICI with the right to provide the financing needed for such purposes. Depending on the state of the credit markets, if we are unable to finance our current or future projects, we could have to seek alternative financing, such as through selling assets, restructuring debt, increasing our reliance on equity financing or seeking additional joint venture partners. Depending on credit market conditions, alternative sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development and/or renovation, or such other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe capacity under our revolving credit facility, which expires in 2023, is $700 million. If a large percentage of our lenders were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to us, we could experience decreased levels of liquidity which could have a detrimental impact on our operations. There is no certainty that our lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our senior secured credit facility.\nOur indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us that could limit our operations and lead to events of default if we do not comply with those covenants.\nOur senior secured credit facility requires us, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests, including interest coverage, senior secured net leverage and total net leverage ratios. In addition, our credit facility restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee obligations, repay certain other indebtedness or amend debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on our assets, make investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates or otherwise restrict corporate activities. In addition, the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding certain indebtedness under our credit facility), issue certain preferred stock, pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, create liens on our assets to secure certain debt, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with another company, transfer and sell assets and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the documentation governing any of our indebtedness, termination of the Leases (subject to certain exceptions) or the occurrence of certain defaults under the Leases could lead to an event of default thereunder that could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. Such acceleration would likely constitute an event of default under our other indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness. We also may incur indebtedness related to facilities we develop or acquire in the future prior to generating cash flow from those facilities. If those facilities do not provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness, we will need to rely on cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage. In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly. As we are required to satisfy amortization requirements under our senior secured credit facility or as other debt matures, we may also need to raise funds to refinance all or a portion of our debt. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our senior secured credit facility, on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all.
