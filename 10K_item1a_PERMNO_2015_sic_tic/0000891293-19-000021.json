{"cik": "891293", "company": "CTI BIOPHARMA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the risks described below and elsewhere in this document, including the risk that our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, operating results or prospects and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe were incorporated in 1991 and have incurred a net operating loss every year since our formation. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.2 billion, and we expect to continue to incur net losses. As part of our business plan, we will need to continue to conduct research, development, testing and regulatory compliance activities with respect to our compounds and ensure the procurement of manufacturing and drug supply services, the costs of which, together with projected general and administrative expenses, is expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurances that we will ever achieve profitability.\nOur prospects are dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of pacritinib.\nWe have resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement in October 2016, and we are no longer eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinib\u2019s development from Baxalta. Because obtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, the termination of this collaborative partnership could negatively impact our ability to successfully develop and commercialize pacritinib. Even if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for pacritinib, it would face competition from currently approved compounds and potentially other candidates being developed by our competitors. We currently have no commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund the development and commercial launch of pacritinib, and we may need to seek additional funding, which may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms. We could also seek another collaborative partnership for the development and commercialization of pacritinib, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we partner pacritinib, we may have to relinquish valuable economic rights and would potentially forgo additional economic benefits that could be realized if we continued the development and commercialization activities alone. Even if pacritinib receives approval from the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities, we would need to incur significant expenses to support the commercialization and launch of pacritinib, which investment may never be realized if sales are insufficient. As our primary product candidate under development, our prospects are substantially dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of pacritinib. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize pacritinib, our business would be materially and adversely impacted as we have no other product candidates in active clinical development.\nWe face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.\nCompetition in the oncology market is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological and product development. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market. Our competitors in the U.S. and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Specifically:\n\u2022If we are successful in bringing pacritinib to market, pacritinib will face competition from the currently approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, Jakafi\u00ae / Jakavi\u00ae and may face competition from fedratinib, which Celgene has announced is being prepared for an NDA submission in myelofibrosis. Celgene announced their pending acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb in January 2019. Pacritinib may also face competition from momelotinib, which Sierra Oncology acquired from Gilead and has announced will likely require an additional clinical study to consolidate data across the momelotinib development program.\nIn addition to the specific competitive factors discussed above, new anti-cancer drugs that may be under development or developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.\nMany of our competitors, particularly multinational pharmaceutical companies, either alone or together with their collaborators, have substantially greater financial and technical resources and substantially larger development and marketing teams than us, as well as significantly greater experience than we do in developing, commercializing, manufacturing, marketing and selling products. As a result, products of our competitors might come to market sooner or might prove to be more effective, less expensive, have fewer side effects or be easier to administer than ours. In any such case, sales of any potential future product would likely suffer and we might never recoup the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to develop and market these compounds.\nEven if our compounds are successful in clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals, we or our collaboration partners may not be able to successfully commercialize them.\nThe development and ongoing clinical trials for our compounds may not be successful and, even if they are, the resulting products may never be successfully developed into commercial products. Even if we are successful in our clinical trials and in obtaining other regulatory approvals, the respective products may not reach or remain in the market for a number of reasons including:\n\u2022they may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects;\n\u2022they may be difficult to manufacture on a scale necessary for commercialization;\n\u2022they may experience excessive product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, inadequate transportation or storage, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields or variability in product characteristics;\n\u2022they may be uneconomical to produce;\n\u2022political and legislative changes may make the commercialization of our product candidates more difficult;\n\u2022we may fail to obtain reimbursement approvals or pricing that is cost effective for patients as compared to other available forms of treatment or that covers the cost of production and other expenses;\n\u2022they may not compete effectively with existing or future alternatives;\n\u2022we may be unable to develop commercial operations and to sell marketing rights;\n\u2022they may fail to achieve market acceptance; or\n\u2022we may be precluded from commercialization of a product due to proprietary rights of third parties.\nUncertainty and speculation continue regarding the possible repeal of all or a portion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through legislative action, as well as possible changes to the regulations implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by the Department of Health and Human Services. The uncertainty this causes for the healthcare industry could also adversely affect the commercialization of our products. If we fail to commercialize products or if our future products do not achieve significant market acceptance, we will not likely generate significant revenues or become profitable.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to operate our business, but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise required capital when needed could harm our liquidity, financial condition, business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have substantial operating expenses associated with the development of our compounds, and we have significant contractual payment obligations. Our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $67.0 million as of December 31, 2018. In February 2018, we received approximately $64.2 million in net proceeds from an offering of common stock. In addition, we received a $10.0 million milestone payment from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in February 2019 relating to the achievement of a worldwide net sales milestone of TRISENOX in December 2018. While we believe that our present financial resources will be sufficient to fund our operations through the second quarter of 2020, cash forecasts and capital requirements are subject to change as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties. Developments in and expenses associated with our clinical trials and other research and development activities, including the resumption of primary responsibilities for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the\nPacritinib License Agreement in October 2016, acquisitions of compounds or other assets, regulatory approval developments, our ability to consummate appropriate collaborations for development and commercialization activities, our ability to reach milestones triggering payments under applicable contractual arrangements, receive the associated payments, litigation and other disputes, competitive market developments and other unplanned expenses or business developments may consume capital resources earlier than planned. Due to these and other factors, any forecast for the period for which we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations, as well as any other operational or business projection we have disclosed, or may, from time to time, disclose, may fail.\nWe may need to acquire additional funds in order to develop our business. We may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, disposition of assets, debt financings or restructurings, bank borrowings or other sources of financing. For example, we have a sales agreement in place with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, to sell up to $50.0 million worth of shares of our common stock, from time to time, through an \u201cat-the-market\u201d equity offering program under which Cowen will act as sales agent. However, our ability to raise capital is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, constraints and consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities is restricted by the limited number of our residual authorized shares, the potential difficulty of obtaining stockholder approval to increase authorized shares and the restrictive covenants under our secured term loan agreement;\n\u2022issuance of equity-based securities will dilute the proportionate ownership of existing stockholders;\n\u2022our ability to obtain further funds from any potential loan arrangements is limited by our existing loan and security agreement;\n\u2022certain financing arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to various assets and/or impose more restrictive terms than any of our existing or past arrangements; and\n\u2022we may be required to meet additional regulatory requirements, and we may be subject to certain contractual limitations, which may increase our costs and harm our ability to obtain funding.\nFor these and other reasons, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or-equity linked securities, including pursuant to our at-the-market offering facility with Cowen, our stockholders may experience dilution. If we fail to obtain additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses, be unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, refrain from making our contractually required payments when due (including debt payments) and/or be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Any of these consequences could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe may never be able to generate significant product revenues.\nWe anticipate that, for at least the next several years, our ability to generate significant revenues and become profitable will be substantially dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize pacritinib. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our development stage or approved products as planned, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe are dependent on third-party service providers for a number of critical operational activities including, in particular, for the manufacture, testing and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations, as well as for clinical trial activities. Any failure or delay in these undertakings by third parties could harm our business.\nOur business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under contractual relationships. In particular, we rely heavily on third parties for the manufacture and testing of our compounds. We do not have internal analytical laboratory or manufacturing facilities to allow the testing or production of compounds in compliance with GLP and cGMP. As a result, we rely on third parties to supply us in a timely manner with manufactured products/product candidates. We may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. In particular, we depend on third-party manufacturers to conduct their operations in compliance with GLP and cGMP or similar standards imposed by the U.S. and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA. Any of these regulatory authorities may take action against a contract\nmanufacturer who violates GLP and cGMP. Failure of our manufacturers to comply with FDA, EMA or other applicable regulations may cause us to curtail or stop the manufacture of such products until we obtain regulatory compliance.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our compounds if we are unable to secure manufacturers when needed, or if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or otherwise fail to manufacture compounds according to our schedule and specifications or fail to comply with cGMP regulations. In particular, in connection with the transition of the manufacturing of pacritinib drug supply to successor vendors, we could face logistical, scaling or other challenges that may adversely affect supply. Furthermore, in order to ultimately obtain and maintain applicable regulatory approvals, any manufacturers we utilize are required to consistently produce the respective compounds in commercial quantities and of specified quality or execute fill-finish services on a repeated basis and document their ability to do so, which is referred to as process validation. In order to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of a compound, the applicable regulatory authority must consider the result of the applicable process validation to be satisfactory and must otherwise approve of the manufacturing process. Even if our compound manufacturing processes obtain regulatory approval and sufficient supply is available to complete clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval, there are no guarantees we will be able to supply the quantities necessary to effect a commercial launch of the applicable drug, or once launched, to satisfy ongoing demand. Any compound shortage could also impair our ability to deliver contractually required supply quantities to applicable collaborators, as well as to complete any additional planned clinical trials.\nWe also rely on third-party service providers for certain warehousing, transportation, sales, order processing, distribution and cash collection services. With regard to the distribution of our compounds, we depend on third-party distributors to act in accordance with GDP, and the distribution process and facilities are subject to continuing regulation by applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the distribution and storage of products.\nIn addition, we depend on medical institutions and CROs (together with their respective agents) to conduct clinical trials and associated activities in compliance with GCP and in accordance with our timelines, expectations and requirements. To the extent any such third parties are delayed in achieving or fail to meet our clinical trial enrollment expectations, fail to conduct our trials in accordance with GCP or study protocol or otherwise take actions outside of our control or without our consent, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, subjecting us to additional risks and challenges, including, in particular, as a result of the engagement of foreign medical institutions and foreign CROs, who may be less experienced with regard to regulatory matters applicable to us and may have different standards of medical care.\nWith regard to certain of the foregoing clinical trial operations and stages in the manufacturing and distribution chain of our compounds, we rely on single vendors. In addition, in the event pacritinib is approved, we will initially have only one commercial supplier for pacritinib. We may in the future seek to qualify an additional manufacturer of pacritinib, but the process for qualifying a manufacturer, and seeking prior regulatory approval for a new manufacturer, can be lengthy and may not occur on a timely basis or at all. The use of single vendors for core operational activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacturing and distribution, and the resulting lack of diversification, expose us to the risk of a material interruption in service related to these single, outside vendors. As a result, our exposure to this concentration risk could harm our business.\nAlthough we monitor the compliance of our third-party service providers performing the aforementioned services, we cannot be certain that such service providers will consistently comply with applicable regulatory requirements or that they will otherwise timely satisfy their obligations to us. Any such failure and/or any failure by us to monitor their services and to plan for and manage our short and long term requirements underlying such services could result in shortage of the compound, delays in or cessation of clinical trials, failure to obtain or revocation of product approvals or authorizations, product recalls, withdrawal or seizure of products, suspension of an applicable wholesale distribution authorization and/or distribution of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, other administrative or judicial sanctions (including civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution) and/or unanticipated related expenditures to resolve shortcomings. Such consequences could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which was amended in May 2018, the proceeds of which were partially used to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under our loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital.\nBorrowings under this loan and security agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets except intellectual property and subject to certain other exceptions. The loan and security agreement restricts our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our business assets or property, subject to limited exceptions;\n\u2022make material changes to our business or management;\n\u2022enter into transactions resulting in significant changes to the voting control of our stock;\n\u2022make certain changes to our organizational structure;\n\u2022consolidate or merge with other entities or acquire other entities;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or create encumbrances on our assets;\n\u2022pay dividends, other than dividends paid solely in our common shares, or make distributions on and, in certain cases, repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022repay subordinated indebtedness; or\n\u2022make certain investments.\nIn addition, we are required under our loan agreement and security agreement to comply with various affirmative covenants. The covenants and restrictions and obligations in our loan and security agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan and security agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable and eliminate our eligibility to receive additional loans under the agreement.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when they mature, or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our business operations and financial condition.\nWe will incur a variety of costs for, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of, acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic transactions.\nWe evaluate and undertake acquisitions, collaborations and other strategic transactions from time to time. The process of negotiating these transactions, as well as integrating any acquisitions and implementing any strategic alliances, may result in operating difficulties and expenditures. In addition, these transactions may require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. These undertakings could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and we may never realize the anticipated benefits. In addition, following the consummation of a transaction, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those that affected our results of operations and the market price of our common stock prior to such acquisition. Any of the foregoing consequences resulting from transactions of the type described above could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nIf we are unable to recruit, retain, integrate and motivate senior management, other key personnel and directors, or if such persons are unable to perform effectively, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain senior management, other key personnel and directors to enable the execution of our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our operations are dependent on our ability to integrate and train our new personnel quickly and effectively. In February 2017, we announced the appointment of Adam Craig, M.D., Ph.D., as President and Chief Executive Officer effective March 2017, and also in September 2017, we announced the appointment of Bruce J. Seeley as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and David H. Kirske as Chief Financial Officer. In\nDecember 2018, we announced a restructuring plan to improve efficiencies and reduce costs within the organization, which resulted in workforce reductions impacting approximately half of the total number of our employees immediately prior to the restructuring. These leadership transitions, management changes and the recent reduction in force can be difficult to manage and may create uncertainty or disruption to our business, increase the likelihood of turnover in our other officers and employees and negatively impact our ability to recruit.\nDirectors and management of publicly traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits and stockholder claims, as well as governmental, creditor and other claims that may be made against them. Due to these and other reasons, such persons are also becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors and officers liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending such claims. We currently carry directors and officers liability insurance. However, directors and officers liability insurance is expensive and can be difficult to obtain, particularly for companies like ours that have had a history of litigation. If we are unable to continue to provide directors and officers sufficient liability insurance at affordable rates or at all, or if directors and officers perceive our ability to do so in the future to be limited, it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain management and qualified directors to serve on our Board of Directors.\nThe loss of the services of senior management, other key personnel or directors and/or the inability to timely attract or integrate such persons could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nOne component of our business strategy is the in-licensing and acquisition of drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories, such as pacritinib. Competition for new promising compounds and commercial products can be intense. If we are not able to identify future in-licensing or acquisition opportunities and enter into arrangements on acceptable terms, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nWe may owe additional amounts for VAT related to our operations in Europe.\nOur European operations are subject to the VAT which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased and sold throughout Europe. We historically carried out research and development activities in Italy and incurred value added tax, or VAT, from Italian suppliers on the acquisition of goods and services in Italy. This VAT should be considered as an Input VAT credit. We treated the majority of our sales made in Italy without output VAT (on the basis that the supplies should be considered outside the scope of Italian VAT). This resulted in the value of input VAT exceeding the value of output VAT, and accordingly we submitted a refund claim for the VAT. The Italian Tax Authority, or the ITA, has challenged the treatment of the sales transactions and claimed that the sales transactions made by us should have been subject to output VAT. Our Italian VAT receivable was $4.5 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn April 14, 2009, December 21, 2009 and June 25, 2010, the ITA issued notices of assessment to CTI (Europe) based on the ITA\u2019s audit of CTI (Europe)\u2019s VAT returns for the years 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The ITA audits concluded that CTI (Europe) did not collect and remit VAT on certain invoices issued to non-Italian clients for services performed by CTI (Europe). The assessments, including interest and penalties, for the years 2003, 2006 and 2007 are \u20ac0.6 million, \u20ac2.7 million and \u20ac0.9 million, respectively. While we are defending ourselves against the assessments both on procedural grounds and on the merits of the case, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in such defense. The 2005 VAT assessment was decided in favor of the Company by the Italian Supreme Court, with no further potential liabilities for the Company. Further information pertaining to these cases can be found in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\" and is incorporated by reference herein. If the final decision of the Italian Supreme Court is unfavorable to us, or if, in the interim, the ITA were to make a demand for payment and we were to be unsuccessful in suspending collection efforts, we may be requested to pay to the ITA an amount up to \u20ac4.2 million, or approximately $4.8 million converted using the currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2018, including interest and penalties for the period lapsed between the date in which the assessments were issued and the date of effective payment.\nWe are currently subject to certain regulatory and legal proceedings, and may in the future be subject to additional proceedings and/or allegations of wrong-doing, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory matters and legal claims, including possible securities, derivative, consumer protection and other types of proceedings pursued by individuals, entities or regulatory\nbodies. See Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies,\" for more information regarding the regulatory matters and legal claims in which we are currently involved. Additionally, we were previously required to supply documents in response to a subpoena from the SEC in connection with an investigation into potential federal securities law violations; however, in August 2018, the SEC staff sent a letter stating that it had concluded its investigation of us, and, based on information it had as of that date, it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against us. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and we have had and may in the future have unfavorable rulings and settlements. Adverse outcomes may result in significant monetary damages and penalties or injunctive relief against us. It is possible that our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in any period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings we are or may be subject to, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed. The ultimate outcome of litigation and other claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, and our view of these matters may change in the future.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings we are or may be party to in the future. In addition, negative publicity resulting from any allegations of wrong-doing could harm our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether there is a finding of liability. Furthermore, we may have to incur substantial time and expense in connection with such lawsuits and management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business as we respond to the litigation. Our insurance is subject to high deductibles and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages. In the event of negative publicity resulting from allegations of wrong-doing and/or an adverse outcome under any currently pending or future lawsuit, our business could be materially harmed.\nA variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we engage in significant cross-border activities, we will be subject to risks related to international operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for initiating clinical trials and maintaining approval of drugs in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, political instability or open conflict in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations of doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in North America;\n\u2022\nlikelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations, which likelihood may increase with an increase of operations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntighter restrictions on privacy and the collection and use of data, including genetic material, may apply in jurisdictions outside of North America; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nIf any of these issues were to occur, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur net operating losses may not be available to reduce future income tax liability.\nWe have substantial tax loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but our ability to use such carryforwards to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, as a result of prior changes in the stock ownership of our company. Moreover, future changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, may further limit our ability to use our net operating losses.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the United States signed into law, on December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhances and extends through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act. The rate adjustment to deferred tax assets, a discrete item for the quarter, is fully offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance: there is therefore no rate impact to us. In addition, there is no impact to current or deferred taxes related to the one-time deemed repatriation, as our foreign subsidiaries do not have cumulative positive earnings and profits. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the 2017 Tax Act as further guidance is released. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We use significant judgment in evaluating our worldwide income-tax provision. During the ordinary course of business, we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income-tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur international operations subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. We believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.\nDue to the fact that we have a European subsidiary conducting operations, together with the fact that we are party to certain contractual arrangements denoting monetary amounts in foreign currencies, we are subject to risk regarding currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the translation of euro-denominated financial results and accounts into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, in our European subsidiary will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro. Any expansion of our commercial operations in Europe may increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, certain of our contractual arrangements, denote monetary amounts in foreign currencies, and consequently, the ultimate financial impact to us from a U.S. dollar perspective is subject to significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, in which the majority of voters voted in\nfavor of an exit from the European Union has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and caused severe volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies (in particular, the euro) might have an adverse effect on our reported operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to produce a particular product or product candidate.\nWe may not be able to purchase the materials necessary to produce a particular product or product candidate in adequate volume and quality. If any raw material required to produce a product or product candidate is insufficient in quantity or quality, if a supplier fails to deliver in a timely fashion or at all or if these relationships terminate, we may not be able to qualify and obtain a sufficient supply from alternate sources on acceptable terms, or at all.\nBecause there is a risk of product liability associated with our compounds, we face potential difficulties in obtaining insurance, and if product liability lawsuits were to be successfully brought against us, our business may be harmed.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human pharmaceutical products. If our insurance covering a compound is not maintained on acceptable terms or at all, we might not have adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or limit the commercialization of any products we develop. A successful product liability claim could also exceed our insurance coverage and could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of a product or stolen product could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of a product that do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit product may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit product sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nWe may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, manufacture, storage, handlings, treatment, transportation and disposal of such materials and certain waste products and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources. Compliance with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption. Any such successful attacks could result in the theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. We have invested in our systems and the protection of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption, and we monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. We anticipate needing to make further investments in protecting against these matters going forward. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows. Our contract manufacturers and other service providers face similar risks with respect to interruptions, breakdowns, and other security incidents, and any incidents suffered by our service providers can result in similar impacts upon our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows.\nWhile we maintain insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by any security incidents. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from serious disaster.\nOur headquarters are located in Seattle, Washington. We are vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes that could disrupt our operations. If a natural disaster, power outage, fire or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of a natural disaster or earthquake, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may lose samples or other valuable data. The occurrence of any of the forgoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe recently implemented a restructuring plan, which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended benefits.\nIn December 2018, we announced a restructuring plan to improve our efficiencies and reduce costs. We may incur significant costs to implement this restructuring plan, and doing so may subject us to litigation risks and expenses. Moreover, while we currently expect to realize cost savings of approximately $20 million primarily associated with reduced employee costs over the next three years as a result of our restructuring plan, there can be no assurance that the restructuring plan will achieve its intended benefits. In addition, our restructuring plan may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. As a result, our restructuring plan and its implementation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nThe regulatory approval process for pacritinib has been subject to delay and uncertainty associated with clinical holds placed on pacritinib clinical trials in February 2016 and the withdrawal of the MAA in Europe. While the full clinical hold on pacritinib trials has been removed, our dose-exploration trial for pacritinib and further registration clinical trials for pacritinib could be subject to further delay or we could be prevented from further studying pacritinib or seeking its commercialization.\nOn February 8, 2016, the FDA notified us that a full clinical hold had been placed on pacritinib clinical studies. A full clinical hold is a suspension of the clinical work requested under an IND application. Under the full clinical hold, all patients on pacritinib at the time of the hold order were required to discontinue pacritinib immediately, and no new patients could be enrolled or start pacritinib as initial or crossover treatment. In January 2017, the full clinical hold was removed following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and 2 trials and FDA agreement on a proposed study design for a dose-exploration clinical trial. In July 2017, we enrolled the first patient in the PAC203 trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of three dosing schedules over 24 weeks in patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with ruxolitinib. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC. Following meetings with the FDA and EMA and in consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second IDMC review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as\nrequested by the FDA. Based on FDA feedback received at a July Type B meeting, we plan to conduct a randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis. The dosing for the Phase 3 study will be determined using the results of the PAC203 study. We completed a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2018 and received input from the FDA on key elements of the design of the new randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in adult patients with myelofibrosis (primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis) and who have severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of less than 50,000 per microliter). Before commencing the Phase 3 study, we plan to seek FDA advice on the proposed final protocol design and seek scientific advice from European countries to support alignment on the Phase 3 study design. Although the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review in January 2019 and recommended that the PAC203 study continue without modification, we cannot be certain that the proposed new Phase 3 study will be sufficient for regulatory approval or that the full data from the PAC203 study will not raise additional questions from the FDA or identify an optimal dose or dosing regimen of pacritinib that can be used in the planned Phase 3 registration study, and the FDA may again request additional information or require us to pursue new clinical safety trials with changes to, among other things, protocol, study design or sample size.\nFurther, in the EMA\u2019s initial assessment report regarding our original MAA, the CHMP determined that the current application was not approvable because of major objections in the areas of efficacy, safety (hematological and cardiovascular toxicity) and the overall risk-benefit profile of pacritinib. After the filing of the original MAA, data from the second phase 3 trial of pacritinib, PERSIST-2, were reported. Following discussions with the EMA about how PERSIST-2 data might address the major objections and how to integrate the data into the current application, we withdrew the original MAA, and submitted a new application for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis who have thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter). The new MAA was validated by the EMA in July 2017; however, we withdrew the MAA in February 2019 following interactions with CHMP, during which we learned that CHMP was likely to formally adopt a negative opinion in its evaluation of the application. CHMP indicated that the risk-benefit profile for pacritinib for the intended indication has not been sufficiently established with the clinical data available to date. For additional information regarding the status of our clinical development efforts, see Part I, Item 2, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview.\"\nThe submission of new marketing applications, complying with any additional requests for information from the FDA or EMA or making any changes to protocol, study design, or sample size may be time-consuming, expensive and delay or prevent our ability to continue to study pacritinib. If we are unable to address any further recommendations, requests, or objections in a manner satisfactory to the FDA or EMA, as applicable, in a timely manner, or at all, we could be delayed or prevented from seeking commercialization of pacritinib. Delays in the commercialization of pacritinib would prevent us from receiving future milestone or royalty payments, and otherwise significantly harm our business.\nWe previously sought accelerated approval and requested Priority Review of our NDA for pacritinib. However, following the full clinical hold placed on pacritinib in February 2016, we subsequently withdrew our NDA. If we seek and the FDA does not grant accelerated approval or priority review for pacritinib or any of our other product candidates, we would experience a longer time to commercialization, if such product candidates are commercialized at all, our development costs would increase and our competitive position could be materially harmed.\nIf our development and commercialization collaborations are not successful, or if we are unable to enter into additional collaborations, we may not be able to effectively develop and/or commercialize our compounds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on the success of our development and commercialization collaborations. If our existing collaborations fail, or if we do not successfully enter into additional collaborations when needed, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize the applicable compounds, generate revenues to sustain or grow our business or achieve profitability, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nCompounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to reach later stages of development for a number of reasons, including, among others, that clinical trials may take longer to complete than expected or may not be completed at all, and top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reports may ultimately differ from actual results once existing data are more fully evaluated.\nSuccessful development of anti-cancer and other pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain, and obtaining regulatory approval to market drugs to treat cancer is expensive, difficult and speculative. Compounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to reach later stages of development for several reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022delay or failure in obtaining necessary U.S. and international regulatory approvals, or the imposition of a partial or full regulatory hold on a clinical trial;\n\u2022difficulties in formulating a compound, scaling the manufacturing process, timely attaining process validation for particular drug products and obtaining manufacturing approval;\n\u2022pricing or reimbursement issues or other factors that may make the product uneconomical to commercialize;\n\u2022production problems, such as the inability to obtain raw materials or supplies satisfying acceptable standards for the manufacture of our products, equipment obsolescence, malfunctions or failures, product quality/contamination problems or changes in regulations requiring manufacturing modifications;\n\u2022inefficient cost structure of a compound compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022obstacles resulting from proprietary rights held by others with respect to a compound, such as patent rights;\n\u2022lower than anticipated rates of patient enrollment as a result of factors, such as the number of patients with the relevant conditions, the proximity of patients to clinical testing centers, eligibility criteria for tests and competition with other clinical testing programs;\n\u2022preclinical or clinical testing requiring significantly more time than expected, resources or expertise than originally expected and inadequate financing, which could cause clinical trials to be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022failure of clinical testing to show potential products to be safe and efficacious, and failure to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy characteristics in human clinical trials;\n\u2022suspension of a clinical trial at any time by us, an applicable collaboration partner or a regulatory authority on the basis that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons;\n\u2022delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and trial sites; and\n\u2022failure of third parties, such as CROs, academic institutions, collaborators, cooperative groups and/or investigator sponsors, to conduct, oversee and monitor clinical trials and results.\nFor example, although PIXUVRI received conditional marketing authorization in the E.U. in May 2012, we were required to conduct a post-authorization trial, referred to as PIX306, comparing PIXUVRI and rituximab with gemcitabine and rituximab in the setting of aggressive B-cell NHL and follicular grade 3 lymphoma. In July 2018, we and Servier announced that PIXUVRI plus rituximab did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine plus rituximab and in February 2019, we and Servier mutually agreed to terminate our collaborative agreement.\nIn addition, from time to time, we report top-line data for clinical trials. Such data are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data, and such findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. Top-line or preliminary data are based on important assumptions, estimations, calculations and information then available to us to the extent we have had, at the time of such reporting, an opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate such information in light of all surrounding facts, circumstances, recommendations and analyses. As a result, top-line results may differ from future results, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once existing data have been more fully evaluated. In addition, third parties, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular compound and our business in general.\nIf the development of our compounds is delayed or fails, or if top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reported differ from actual results, our development costs may increase and the ability to commercialize our compounds may be harmed, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nIf we seek and the FDA does not grant accelerated approval or priority review for a drug candidate, we would experience a longer time to commercialization in the U.S., if commercialized at all, our development costs may increase and our competitive position may be harmed.\nWe may in the future decide to seek an accelerated approval pathway for our compounds. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint under an accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree that any endpoint we suggest with respect to any of our drug candidates is an appropriate surrogate endpoint. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any application will be accepted or that accelerated approval will be granted on any basis. Even if a product candidate is granted accelerated approval, such accelerated approval is contingent on the sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct one or more post-approval confirmatory trials that demonstrate a clinical benefit. Such confirmatory trial(s) must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial(s) be designed and/or initiated prior to approval. Moreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of a product candidate or indication approved under the accelerated approval pathway for a variety of reasons, including if the trial(s) required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of a product candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug, or if the sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval trial(s) with due diligence.\nIn the event of priority review, the FDA has a goal to (but is not required to) take action on an application within six months after it has accepted an application for filing (rather than a goal of twelve months for a standard review). The FDA grants priority review only if it determines that a product treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness when compared to a standard application. The FDA has broad discretion whether to grant priority review, and, while the FDA has granted priority review to other oncology product candidates, our drug candidates may not receive similar designation. Moreover, receiving priority review from the FDA does not guarantee completion of review or approval within the targeted six-month cycle or thereafter.\nA failure to obtain accelerated approval or priority review would result in a longer time to commercialization of the applicable compound in the U.S., if commercialized at all, could increase the cost of development and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nWe or our collaboration partners may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to develop or commercialize some or all of our compounds.\nWe are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable agencies in other jurisdictions, including the EMA in the E.U. Some of our other product candidates are currently in research or development and, other than conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI in the E.U., we have not received marketing approval for our compounds. Our products may not be marketed in the U.S. until they have been approved by the FDA and may not be marketed in other jurisdictions until they have received approval from the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies. Each product candidate requires significant research, development and preclinical testing and extensive clinical investigation before submission of any regulatory application for marketing approval. Obtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we may not be able to obtain approval of any of our products on a timely basis, or at all. For instance, in February 2016, the FDA placed pacritinib on full clinical hold and the clinical hold was not removed until January 2017. The number, size, design and focus of preclinical and clinical trials that will be required for approval by the FDA, the EMA or any other foreign regulatory agency varies depending on the compound, the disease or condition that the compound is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular compound. For example, in July 2018, we attended a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed regulatory pathway for pacritinib. Based on FDA feedback at the meeting, we intend to conduct a randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis, which Phase 3 study will require significant time and resources to complete and, even if completed, may not be sufficient to support approval. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or preclude regulatory approval. The FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a compound for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a compound may not be shown to be safe or effective;\n\u2022the clinical and other benefits of a compound may not outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022clinical trial results may be negative or inconclusive, or adverse medical events may occur during a clinical trial;\n\u2022the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by regulatory agencies for approval;\n\u2022such regulatory agencies may interpret data from pre-clinical and clinical trials in different ways than we do;\n\u2022such regulatory agencies may not approve the manufacturing process of a compound or determine that a third-party contract manufacturers manufactures a compound in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n\u2022a compound may fail to comply with regulatory requirements; or\n\u2022such regulatory agencies might change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf our compounds are not approved at all or quickly enough to provide net revenues to defray our operating expenses, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nThe pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement and access to drugs, which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nTo the extent our products are developed, commercialized and successfully introduced to market, they may not be considered cost-effective and third-party or government reimbursement might not be available or sufficient. Globally, governmental and other third-party payors are becoming increasingly aggressive in attempting to contain health care costs by strictly controlling, directly or indirectly, pricing and reimbursement and, in some cases, limiting or denying coverage altogether on the basis of a variety of justifications, and we expect pressures on pricing and reimbursement from both governments and private payors inside and outside the U.S. to continue. In the U.S., we are subject to substantial pricing, reimbursement and access pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, and implementation of U.S. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act instituted comprehensive health care reform, which includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement and impose new and/or increased taxes. In addition, members of the Trump administration, including the President, have made public statements criticizing pricing practices within the pharmaceutical industry, indicating that they may seek to increase pricing pressures on the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn almost all European markets, pricing and choice of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. Therefore, the price of our products and their reimbursement in Europe is and will be determined by national regulatory authorities. Reimbursement decisions from one or more of the European markets may impact reimbursement decisions in other European markets. A variety of factors are considered in making reimbursement decisions, including whether there is sufficient evidence to show that treatment with the product is more effective than current treatments, that the product represents good value for money for the health service it provides and that treatment with the product works at least as well as currently available treatments. The continuing efforts of governments and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payors of health care costs, to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect the availability of capital, as well as our future revenues and profitability or those of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners.\nPost-approval or authorization regulatory reviews and obligations often result in significant expense and marketing limitations, and any failure to satisfy such ongoing obligations could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nEven if a product receives regulatory approval or authorization, as applicable, we are and will continue to be subject to numerous regulations and statutes regulating the manner of obtaining reimbursement for and selling the product, including limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed, promoted and advertised. Approved or authorized products are subject to extensive manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping regulations. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports. In addition, such products are subject to ongoing maintenance of product registration and continued compliance with cGMPs, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and good laboratory practices, or GLPs for post-approval studies. Further, distribution of products must be conducted in accordance with good distribution practices, or GDPs. The distribution process and facilities of our third-party distributors are subject to, and our wholesale distribution authorization by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency subjects us to, continuing regulation by applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the distribution and storage of products. Regulatory authorities may also impose new restrictions on continued product marketing or may require the withdrawal of a product from the market if adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency are discovered following approval. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose post-approval/post-authorization clinical trials, such as the PIX306 trial of PIXUVRI required by the EMA. In\nJuly 2018, we and Servier announced that PIXUVRI plus rituximab did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine plus rituximab, and in February 2019, we and Servier mutually agreed to terminate our collaborative agreement, which limits our ability to receive future payments and royalties related to PIXUVRI. For more information on the termination of our agreement with Servier, see the section of this report captioned \u201cBusiness - License Agreements - Servier.\u201d\nAny other failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in warning or untitled letters, product recalls, interruption of manufacturing and commercial supply processes, withdrawal or seizure of products, suspension of an applicable wholesale distribution authorization and/or distribution of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, revocation of the applicable product\u2019s approval or authorization, other administrative or judicial sanctions (including civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution) and/or unanticipated related expenditure to resolve shortcomings, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for non-FDA-approved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, ultimate sale and use of products that are subject to FDA, EMA and or other regulatory agencies regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. This means that in the U.S., we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome, generate negative publicity and may result in fines or payments of settlement awards. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations related to health care fraud and abuse, false claims, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, in which violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the sales, marketing and education programs for our products. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program. The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. Any allegation, investigation, or violation of these domestic health care fraud and abuse laws could result in government or internal investigations, significant diversion of resources, exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, significant fines, penalties, or other financial consequences, any of which may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor our sales and operations outside the United States, we are similarly subject to various heavily-enforced anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws around the world. These laws generally prohibit U.S. companies and their employees and intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any advantage. We face significant risks if we, which includes our third parties, fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nWe leverage various third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our commercial partners and our other third-party intermediaries, including collaborators and licensees, may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities (such as in the context of obtaining government approvals, registrations, or licenses or sales to government owned or controlled health care facilities,\nuniversities, institutes, clinics, etc.) and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, collaborators, licensees and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. To that end, while we have adopted and implemented internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such compliance measures ultimately may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, collaborators, licensees, agents and other third parties or intermediaries from violating or circumventing our policies and/or the law.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nOur employees, collaborators and other personnel may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, collaborators, vendors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA, EMA and other regulators, providing inaccurate or misleading information to the FDA, EMA and other regulators, failure to comply with data privacy and security and healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, reporting inaccurate financial information or clinical data or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Additionally, laws regarding data privacy and security, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, as well as applicable laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation and Clinical Trials Regulation, the latter of which will replace the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive and which is expected to take effect beginning in late 2019 or in 2020, may impose obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, use, security, transmission and other processing of individually identifiable health information and other personal data that we may collect, retain, and otherwise process. As the General Data Protection Regulation entered into force recently, guidance on implementation and compliance practices are still being developed, updated or otherwise revised. Although the General Data Protection Regulation is intended to provide for a high level of harmonization across the European Union, Member States may still implement certain variations, and data protection authorities may enforce the General Data Protection Regulation and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. Furthermore, there is a trend towards the public disclosure of clinical trial data in the E.U. which also adds to the complexity of processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new E.U. Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the General Data Protection Regulation, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation. Additionally, we rely on the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission in order to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. These standard contractual clauses are subject to legal challenge in the E.U., and it is possible that they will be invalidated or modified. In such event, we could need to implement alternative measures to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all. In the U.S., in addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nVarious laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Any misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives, including consultants, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the\nprecautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf any of our license agreements for intellectual property underlying our compounds are terminated, we may lose the right to develop or market that product.\nWe have acquired or licensed intellectual property from third parties, including patent applications and patents relating to intellectual property for pacritinib and other product candidates. Some of our product development programs depend on our ability to maintain rights under these arrangements. Each licensor has the power to terminate its agreement with us if we fail to meet our obligations under these licenses. We may not be able to meet our obligations under these licenses. If we default under any license agreement, we may lose our right to market and sell any products based on the licensed technology and may be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy may result in the termination of agreements pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property rights.\nWe hold rights under numerous patents that we have acquired or licensed or that protect inventions originating from our research and development, and the expiration of any of these patents may allow our competitors to copy the inventions that are currently protected.\nWe dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. Patents have been issued on many of these applications. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the U.S. and foreign countries directed to pacritinib and other product candidates. However, the lives of these patents are limited. Patents for the individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.\nOur U.S. and foreign method and composition of matter patents for pacritinib expire as follows: U.S. patents expire in May 2028 (method) / January 2029 (compound) / March 2030 (salt); foreign patents expire in November 2026 (method and compound) / December 2029 (salt). We expect our U.S. and foreign patent applications for use of pacritinib for treating transplant rejection will expire in 2036. Pacritinib has orphan drug designation for myelofibrosis in the U.S. and the E.U.\nEach patent may be eligible for future patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. However, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before such candidates are commercialized which may prevent us from obtaining any regulatory extensions if all the patents covering our candidates are expired prior to regulatory approval of the corresponding product candidate. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nAlso, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data may be complementary to patent protection. During a period of regulatory exclusivity, competitors generally may not use the original applicant\u2019s data as the basis for a generic application. In the U.S., the data protection generally runs for five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication.\nIn the absence of a patent, we would, to the extent possible, need to rely on unpatented technology, know-how and confidential information. Ultimately, the lack or expiration at any given time of a patent to protect our compounds may allow our competitors to copy the underlying inventions and better compete with us.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and the potential for long-term success could be harmed.\nDevelopment and protection of our intellectual property are critical to our business. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies. Our success depends in part on our ability to:\n\u2022obtain and maintain patent protection for our products or processes both in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022protect trade secrets; and\n\u2022prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including ours, generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents. If it allows broad claims, the number and cost of patent interference proceedings in the U.S. and the risk of infringement litigation may increase. If it allows narrow claims, the risk of infringement may decrease, but the value of our rights under our patents, licenses and patent applications may also decrease. Patent applications in which we have rights may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable. Litigation, interference proceedings or other governmental proceedings that we may become involved in with respect to our proprietary technologies or the proprietary technology of others could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. Third parties may independently develop such know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology. While we require our employees, consultants and corporate partners with access to proprietary information to enter into confidentiality agreements, these agreements may not be honored.\nPatent litigation is widespread in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, and any patent litigation could harm our business.\nCostly litigation might be necessary to protect a patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights, and we may not have the required resources to pursue any such litigation or to protect our patent rights. Any adverse outcome in litigation with respect to the infringement or validity of any patents owned by third parties could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using a product or technology. With respect to our in-licensed patents, if we attempt to initiate a patent infringement suit against an alleged infringer, it is possible that our applicable licensor will not participate in or assist us with the suit, and as a result, we may not be able to effectively enforce the applicable patents against the alleged infringers.\nWe may be unable to obtain or protect our intellectual property rights and we may be liable for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if unsuccessful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nAt times, we may monitor patent filings for patents that might be relevant to some of our products and product candidates in an effort to guide the design and development of our products to avoid infringement, but may not have conducted an exhaustive search. We may not be able to successfully challenge the validity of third-party patents and could be required to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for past infringement and attorneys\u2019 fees if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe such patents. Further, we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties.\nMoreover, third parties may challenge the patents that have been issued or licensed to us. We do not believe that pacritinib or any of the other compounds we are currently developing infringe upon the rights of any third parties nor do we believe that they are materially infringed upon by third parties; however, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements or redesign our compounds so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed from any third parties. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nEven if infringement claims against us are without merit, or if we challenge the validity of issued patents, lawsuits take significant time, may, even if resolved in our favor, be expensive and divert management attention from other business\nconcerns. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other life sciences companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we or our employees may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. A loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of shares of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of your investment in our securities to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. For example, during the 12-month period ended February 28, 2019, our stock price ranged from a low of $0.60 to a high of $5.36. Fluctuations in the market price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of your investment in our common stock. Factors that may have an impact, which, depending on the circumstances, could be significant, on the market price and marketability of our securities include:\n\u2022announcements by us or others of results of clinical trials and regulatory actions, such as the imposition of a clinical trial hold;\n\u2022announcements by us or others of serious adverse events that have occurred during administration of our products to patients;\n\u2022announcements by us or others relating to our ongoing development and commercialization activities;\n\u2022halting or suspension of trading in our common stock on the Nasdaq;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new commercial therapeutic products by us, our collaborative partners or our present or potential competitors;\n\u2022our issuance of debt or equity securities, which we expect to pursue to generate additional funds to operate our business, or any perception from time to time that we will issue such securities;\n\u2022our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022liquidity, cash position or financing needs;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022developments in relationships with collaborative partners;\n\u2022acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our compounds;\n\u2022litigation and government proceedings;\n\u2022adverse legislation, including changes in governmental regulation;\n\u2022third-party reimbursement policies;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u2022short selling of our securities;\n\u2022changes in health care policies and practices;\n\u2022a failure to achieve previously announced goals and objectives as or when projected; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or the Nasdaq, or trading on the Nasdaq may otherwise be halted or suspended, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock and consequently may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe regained compliance in January 2017 with the minimum $1.00 bid price requirement by effecting a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on January 1, 2017, after receiving notice of non-compliance from the Nasdaq in March 2016.\nWe have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with the Nasdaq requirements. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq for failure to comply with the minimum $1.00 per share closing bid price requirement or for any other reason, it may harm our stock price, increase the volatility of our stock price, decrease the level of trading activity and make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares of our common stock. Our failure to maintain a listing on the Nasdaq may constitute an event of default under our loan and security agreement and any future indebtedness, which would accelerate the maturity date of such debt or trigger other obligations. In addition, certain institutional investors that are not permitted to own securities of non-listed companies may be required to sell their shares adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. If we are not listed on the Nasdaq, our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted. Additionally, for so long as our non-affiliate public float does not exceed $75 million, the amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3 will be limited to the equivalent of one-third of our public float, which will limit our ability to file or use shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and further limit our ability to raise capital. We have relied significantly on shelf registration statements on Form S-3 for most of our financings in recent years, so any such limitations may harm our ability to raise the capital we need. Trading in our common stock has been halted or suspended on the Nasdaq in the past and may also be halted or suspended in the future on the Nasdaq due to market or trading conditions at the discretion of the Nasdaq. Any halt or suspension in the trading in our common stock may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nFuture financing, strategic and other activities may require us to increase the number of authorized shares in our certificate of incorporation. An inability to secure requisite stockholder approval for such increases could materially and adversely impact our ability to fund our operations.\nAt our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we sought and received approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares and the total number of authorized shares of our common stock by 20 million. We proposed the increase in authorized shares due to the fact that we anticipate the need to issue additional shares of common stock in the future in connection with one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nfinancing transactions, such as public or private offerings of common stock or derivative securities;\n\u2022\nour equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan;\n\u2022\ndebt, warrant or other equity restructuring or refinancing transactions, such as debt or warrant exchanges or offerings of new convertible debt or modifications to existing securities, or as payments of interest on debt securities;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and strategic investments;\n\u2022\ncorporate transactions, such as stock splits or stock dividends; and\n\u2022\nother corporate purposes that have not yet been identified.\nWe may seek approval to increase the number of authorized shares again in the future. Without such increases in the number of authorized shares, we may be constrained in our ability to raise capital when needed, and may lose important business opportunities, including to competitors, which could adversely affect our financial performance, growth and ability to continue our operations. As opportunities or circumstances that require prompt action frequently arise, we believe that the delay necessitated for stockholder approval of a specific issuance could result in a material and adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we obtain approval to increase the number of authorized shares, we are required under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to a minimum price as set forth in the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, as well as under certain other circumstances. We have in the past and may in the future issue additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding in order to fund our operations. However, we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for any future issuance that requires stockholder approval pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. If we are unable to obtain financing or our financing options are limited due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may harm our ability to continue operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under Delaware law and in other applicable instruments could make removal of incumbent management or an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests or to effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u2022elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware\u2019s anti-takeover statute, which imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain interested stockholders. Other existing provisions applicable to us that could have an anti-takeover effect include our executive employment agreements and certain provisions of our outstanding equity-based compensatory awards that allow for acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control. Our shareholder rights plan expired pursuant to its terms on December 2, 2018, and was not replaced; however, the Board may, subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law, choose to implement a similar plan in the future. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the future. These provisions prohibit a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d\nThe foregoing provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could adversely affect our investors' confidence, our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner within the time periods required for our financial reporting under SEC rules and regulations. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements or omissions in our financial statements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. We have recently implemented a reduction in force, which may result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. The changes could relate to different employees performing internal control activities than those who have previously performed those activities or revisions to our actual control activities as we evaluate the appropriate internal control structure after our workforce reduction. A changing internal control environment increases the risk that our system of internal controls is not designed effectively or that internal control activities will not occur as designed. The occurrence\nof or failure to remediate a significant deficiency material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could cause you to incur dilution and could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nAs of December 31, 2018, options to purchase 7,219,292 shares of our common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $4.08 per share were outstanding. The exercise of any of these options would result in dilution to current stockholders. Further, because we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and clinical development programs, we may in the future sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Future option grants and issuances of common stock under our share-based compensation plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThese future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and any additional shares of common stock issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business, the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the market price of our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. If securities and industry analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nOur management team has broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from public or private equity or debt financings and the investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return. We may invest the proceeds in ways with which our stockholders disagree.\nWe have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from our November 2017 debt financing and February 2018 public equity offering of our common stock. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of the proceeds and our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities may not improve our results of operation or enhance the value of our common stock. The results and effectiveness of the use of proceeds are uncertain, and we could spend the proceeds in ways that you do not agree with or that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, delay the development of our product candidates and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, until the net proceeds are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.", "PERMNO": 84604, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CTIC"}
