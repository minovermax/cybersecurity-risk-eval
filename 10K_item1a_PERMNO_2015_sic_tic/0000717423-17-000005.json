RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nVolatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAmong the most significant variables affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations are the sales prices for crude oil and natural gas that it produces. The indices against which much of the Company\u2019s production is priced have been volatile in recent years, and sales prices for crude oil and natural gas can be significantly different in U.S. markets compared to markets in foreign locations.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices averaged about $43 per barrel in 2016, compared to $49 per barrel in 2015 and $93 per barrel in 2014. The closing price for WTI at the end of 2016 was approximately $54 per barrel. As demonstrated by the significant decline in WTI crude oil prices in late 2014 and further declines over 2015 and early 2016, prices can be quite volatile. A portion of the Company\u2019s crude oil production is more sour than WTI quality crude; therefore, this crude oil usually sells at a discount to WTI and other light and sweet crude oils. In addition, the sales prices for sour crude oils do not always move in relation to price changes for WTI and lighter/sweeter crude oils, including certain U.S. and Canadian crude oils and all crude oil produced in Malaysia, generally price off oil indices other than WTI, and these indices are influenced by different supply and demand forces than those that affect the U.S. WTI prices. The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company\u2019s crude include Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS), Brent and Malaysian crude oil indices\nThe average NYMEX natural gas sales price was $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2016, down from $2.61 per MCF in 2015 and $4.34 per MCF in 2014. The closing price for NYMEX natural gas trades as of December 31, 2016, was $3.72 per MCF. Certain natural gas production offshore Sarawak have been sold in recent years at a premium to average NYMEX natural gas prices due to pricing structures built into the sales contracts. Associated natural gas produced at fields in Block K offshore Sabah, representing approximately 3% of the Company\u2019s 2016 natural gas sales volumes, is sold at heavily discounted prices compared to NYMEX gas prices as stipulated in the sales contract.\nThe Company cannot predict how changes in the sales prices of oil and natural gas will affect its results of operations in future periods. The Company often seeks to hedge a portion of its exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil and natural gas by selling forwards, swaps and other forms of derivative contracts.\nLow oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations in several ways in the future.\nAs noted elsewhere in this report, crude oil prices were again weaker in 2016 than in prior years. WTI oil prices averaged about $43 per barrel in 2016, but have improved above $50 per barrel in late 2016 and early 2017. Low oil and natural gas prices adversely affect the Company in several ways, and as noted below could continue to do so in 2017 if prices remain low or decline further.\n\u00b7\nLower sales value for the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas production hurts cash flows and net income.\n\u00b7\nLower cash flows may cause the Company to reduce its capital expenditure program, thereby potentially hampering its ability to grow production and add proved reserves. The Company may continue to restrict its capital expenditures to balance its cash positions going forward.\n\u00b7\nLower oil and natural gas prices could lead to further impairment charges in future periods.\n\u00b7\nA weakening of oil and natural gas prices could lead to reductions in the Company\u2019s proved reserves in 2017 or future years. Low prices could make certain of the Company\u2019s proved reserves uneconomic, which in turn could lead to removal of certain of the Company\u2019s 2016 year-end reported proved oil reserves in future periods. These reserve reductions could be significant.\n\u00b7\nLow oil prices have adversely impacted the Company\u2019s financial metrics, and the credit rating agencies tend to lower credit ratings during such periods of low commodity prices. In addition, banks and other suppliers of financing capital have generally reduced their lending limits in response to the lower oil price environment. In February 2016, Moody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded the Company\u2019s senior unsecured notes to a \u201cB1\u201d rating, effectively reducing the Company\u2019s credit to below investment grade status. Also, in February 2016, Fitch Rating downgraded the Company\u2019s notes to below investment grade. Standard & Poor\u2019s rates the Company\u2019s debt as investment grade at \u201cBBB-\u201d. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing is affected by the Company\u2019s debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. Any further lowering of the Company\u2019s debt credit ratings could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to borrow.\n\u00b7\nLow prices for oil and natural gas could lead to weaker market prices for the Company\u2019s common stock and could cause the Company to lower its dividend.\nCertain of these effects are further discussed in risk factors that follow.\nMurphy Oil\u2019s businesses operate in highly competitive environments, which could adversely affect it in many ways, including its profitability, its ability to grow, and its ability to manage its businesses.\nMurphy operates in the oil and gas industry and experiences intense competition from other oil and gas companies, which include state-owned foreign oil companies, major integrated oil companies, and independent producers of oil and natural gas. Virtually all of the state-owned and major integrated oil companies and many of the independent producers that compete with the Company have substantially greater resources than Murphy. In addition, the oil industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying energy requirements around the world. Murphy competes, among other things, for valuable acreage positions, exploration licenses, drilling equipment and human resources.\nIf Murphy cannot replace its oil and natural gas reserves, it may not be able to sustain or grow its business.\nMurphy continually depletes its oil and natural gas reserves as production occurs. In order to sustain and grow its business, the Company must successfully replace the crude oil and natural gas it produces with additional reserves. Therefore, it must create and maintain a portfolio of good prospects for future reserves additions and production by obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas. In addition, it must find, develop and produce and/or purchase reserves at a competitive cost structure to be successful in the long-term. Murphy\u2019s ability to operate profitably in the exploration and production segments of its business, therefore, is dependent on its ability to find, develop and produce and/or purchase oil and natural gas reserves at costs that are less than the realized sales price for these products and at costs competitive with competing companies in the industry. In response to significantly lower oil prices in recent years, the Company has reduced its exploration program from previous years\u2019 levels, which is expected to reduce the rate at which it is able to replace reserves.\nMurphy\u2019s proved reserves are based on the professional judgment of its engineers and may be subject to revision.\nProved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas included in this report on pages 105 through 111 have been prepared by qualified Company personnel or qualified independent engineers based on an unweighted average of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the respective year as well as other conditions and information available at the time the estimates were prepared. Estimation of reserves is a subjective process that involves professional judgment by engineers about volumes to be recovered in future periods from underground oil and natural gas reservoirs. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, and consequently, different engineers could arrive at different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data and using industry accepted engineering practices and scientific methods. Under existing SEC rules, reported proved reserves must be reasonably certain of recovery in future periods.\nMurphy\u2019s actual future oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nOil and natural gas prices which are materially different from prices used to compute proved reserves\n\u00b7\nOperating and/or capital costs which are materially different from those assumed to compute proved reserves\n\u00b7\nFuture reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves, and\n\u00b7\nGovernmental regulations or actions which materially change operations of a field.\nThe Company\u2019s proved undeveloped reserves represent significant portions of total proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 44% of the Company\u2019s crude oil proved reserves, 48% of natural gas liquids proved reserves and 56% of natural gas proved reserves are undeveloped. The ability of the Company to reclassify these undeveloped proved reserves to the proved developed classification is generally dependent on the successful completion of one or more operations, which might include further development drilling, construction of facilities or pipelines, and well workovers.\n\ufeff\nThe discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves as reported on pages 115 and 116 should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP), the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the reserves computations.\nIn addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the crude oil and natural gas business in general.\nExploration drilling results can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company drills exploratory wells each year which subjects its exploration and production operating results to significant exposure to dry holes expense, which may have adverse effects on, and create volatility for, the Company\u2019s results of operations. In response to significantly lower oil prices, the Company has reduced its exploration program from previous years\u2019 levels. In 2016 wildcat wells were primarily drilled offshore Vietnam, Malaysia and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company\u2019s 2017 planned exploratory drilling program presently includes commitment wells in Block SK 314A in Malaysia and in Blocks 11-21/11 and 15-1/05 in Vietnam, and one discretionary well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\nPotential federal or state regulations could increase the Company\u2019s costs and/or restrict operating methods, which could adversely affect its production levels.\nThe Company\u2019s onshore North America oil and gas production is dependent on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing whereby water, sand and certain chemicals are injected into deep oil and gas bearing reservoirs in North America. This process creates fractures in the rock formation within the reservoir which enables oil and natural gas to migrate to the wellbore. The Company primarily uses this technique in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in Western Canada. This practice is generally regulated by the states, but at times the U.S. has proposed additional regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In June 2011, the State of Texas adopted a law requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Provinces of British Columbia and Alberta have also issued regulations related to hydraulic fracturing activities under their jurisdictions. It is possible that the states, the U.S., Canadian provinces and certain municipalities adopt further laws or regulations which could render the process unlawful, less effective or drive up its costs. If any such action is taken in the future, the Company\u2019s production levels could be adversely affected or its costs of drilling and completion could be increased.\nIn April 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s (DOI) Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) enacted broad regulatory changes related to Gulf of Mexico well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment, among other items. These changes are known broadly as the Well Control Rule, and compliance is required over the next several years. Recent BSEE interpretation and enforcement of the Rule appear, at this time, to present reduced risk of a significant business impact to the Company. However, some provisions remain for which BSEE future enforcement action and intent are unclear, so risk of impact leading to increased future cost on the Company\u2019s Gulf of Mexico operations remains.\nIn July 2016, the DOI\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued an updated Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) providing details on revised procedures BOEM will be using to determine a lessee\u2019s ability to carry out decommissioning obligations for activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including the Gulf of Mexico. This revised policy became effective in September 2016 and institutes new criteria by which the BOEM will evaluate the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the OCS. If the BOEM determines under the revised policy that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. In January 2017 BOEM extended the implementation timeline for the NTL by six months for properties which have co-lessees, and in February BOEM withdrew sole liability orders issued in December to allow time for the new administration to review the financial assurance program for decommissioning. Although the Company believes the new BOEM policy will lead to increased costs for its Gulf of Mexico operations, it does not currently believe that the impact will be material to its operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn the future, BOEM and/or BSEE may impose new and more stringent offshore operating regulations which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nHydraulic fracturing exposes the Company to operational and regulatory risks and third party claims.\nHydraulic fracturing operations subject the Company to operational risks inherent in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas. These risks include underground migration or surface spillage due to releases of oil, natural gas, formation water or well fluids, as well as any related surface or ground water contamination, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Ineffective containment of surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination resulting from hydraulic fracturing operations, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, could result in environmental pollution, remediation expenses and third party claims alleging damages, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, hydraulic fracturing requires significant quantities of water, and waste water from oil and gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Certain increased seismic activities have been linked to underground water injection. Any diminished access to water for use in the hydraulic fracturing process, any inability to properly dispose of waste water, or any further restrictions placed on waste water, could curtail the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise result in operational delays or increased costs.\nClimate change initiatives and other environmental rules or regulations could reduce demand for crude oil and natural gas, which may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe issue of climate change has caused considerable attention to be directed towards initiatives to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the United States entered into an international climate agreement (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d) at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 and the United States is one of over 100 nations that have indicated an intent to comply with the agreement, which will take effect in 2020. It is possible that the Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, and other such initiatives, including environmental rules or regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, may reduce the demand for crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and other countries. While the magnitude of any reduction in hydrocarbon demand is difficult to predict, such a development could adversely impact the Company and other companies engaged in the exploration and production business. Although the new U.S. administration has expressed skepticism about the Paris Agreement, it is currently unclear whether the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement or otherwise avoid complying with the agreement.\nCapital financing may not always be available to fund Murphy\u2019s activities.\nMurphy usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to find and develop reserves before revenue is generated from production. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow generated by operations may not fully cover capital funding requirements, especially in periods of low commodity prices such as those experienced in 2015 and 2016. Therefore, the Company maintains financing arrangements with lending institutions to meet certain funding needs. The Company must periodically renew these financing arrangements based on foreseeable financing needs or as they expire. The Company has two primary bank financing facilities with capacities of $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion that mature in May 2017 and August 2019, respectively. There is the possibility that financing arrangements may not always be available at sufficient levels required to fund the Company\u2019s activities in future periods. In February 2016, Moody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded the Company\u2019s senior unsecured notes to a \u201cB1\u201d rating, effectively reducing the Company\u2019s credit to below investment grade status. Also, in February 2016, Fitch Rating downgraded the Company\u2019s notes to below investment grade. These credit ratings of below investment grade could adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise debt as needed in public markets in future periods. Additionally, in order to obtain debt financing in future years, the Company may have to provide more security to its lenders. The downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit rating by Moody\u2019s in 2016 led to increased debt service costs for certain outstanding notes, and also made it more likely that the Company would have to post collateral such as letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements. The Company\u2019s primary revolving credit facility requires granting of security by the Company in certain circumstances. See further explanation in Note G of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of debt and/or equity securities through October 2018. Although not considered likely, the Company may not be able in the future to sell notes in the marketplace at interest rates that are acceptable to it.\nMurphy has limited or virtually no control over several factors that could adversely affect the Company.\nThe ability of the Company to successfully manage development and operating costs is important because virtually all of the products it sells are energy commodities such as crude oil, NGL and natural gas, for which the Company has little or no influence on the sales prices or regional and worldwide consumer demand for these products. Changes in commodity prices also impact the volume of production attributed to the Company under production sharing contracts in Malaysia. Economic slowdowns, such as those experienced in 2008 and 2009, had a detrimental\neffect on the worldwide demand for these energy commodities, which effectively led to reduced prices for oil and natural gas for a period of time. An oversupply of crude oil in 2015 and much of 2016 led to a severe decline in worldwide oil prices. Lower prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas inevitably lead to lower earnings for the Company. The low crude oil price environment in 2016 has caused the Company to reduce spending on discretionary drilling programs, which in turn hurts the Company\u2019s future production levels and future cash flow generated from operations. The Company often experiences pressure on its operating and capital expenditures in periods of strong crude oil and natural gas prices because an increase in exploration and production activities due to high oil and gas sales prices generally leads to higher demand for, and consequently higher costs for, goods and services in the oil and gas industry. The somewhat higher oil prices in late 2016 and early 2017 could lead to inflation in oil field goods and service costs beginning in 2017.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s major oil and natural gas producing properties are operated by others. Therefore, Murphy does not fully control all activities at certain of its significant revenue generating properties. During 2016, approximately 16% of the Company\u2019s total production was at fields operated by others, while at December 31, 2016, approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s total proved reserves were at fields operated by others.\nAdditionally, the Company relies on the availability of transportation and processing facilities that are often owned by others. These third party systems and facilities may not always be available to the Company, and if available, may not be available at a price that is acceptable to the Company.\nFailure of our partners to fund their share of development costs or obtain financing could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.\nSome of Murphy\u2019s development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. As a result, the Company\u2019s partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including financing arrangements. Murphy\u2019s partners are also susceptible to certain of the risk factors noted herein, including, but not limited to, commodity price declines, fiscal regime changes, government project approval delays, regulatory changes, credit downgrades and regional conflict. If one or more of these factors negatively impacts a project partners\u2019 cash flows or ability to obtain adequate financing, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of the Company\u2019s reserves and production, negatively impacting the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.\nMurphy\u2019s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide political developments.\nMany governments, including those that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), unilaterally intervene at times in the orderly market of crude oil and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 23% of the Company\u2019s proved reserves, as defined by the SEC, were located in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. Certain of the reserves held outside these two countries could be considered to have more political risk. In addition, prices and availability of crude oil, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political unrest and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect Murphy\u2019s operations and earnings include expropriation, tax changes, royalty increases, redefinition of international boundaries, preferential and discriminatory awarding of oil and gas leases, restrictions on drilling and/or production, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. Governments could also initiate regulations concerning matters such as currency fluctuations, currency conversion, protection and remediation of the environment, and concerns over the possibility of global warming or other climate change being affected by human activity including the production and use of hydrocarbon energy. A number of non-governmental entities routinely attempt to influence industry members and government energy policy in an effort to limit industry activities, such as hydrocarbon production, drilling and hydraulic fracturing with the desire to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which may harm air quality, and to restrict hydrocarbon spills, which may harm land and/or groundwater. Additionally, because of the numerous countries in which the Company operates, certain other risks exist, including the application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Canada Corruption of Foreign Officials Act, the Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption compliance statutes. Because these and other factors too numerous to list are subject to changes caused by governmental and political considerations and are often made in response to changing internal and worldwide economic conditions and to actions of other governments or specific events, we cannot predict the effects of such factors on Murphy\u2019s future operations and earnings.\nMurphy\u2019s business is subject to operational hazards, security risks and risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.\nThe Company operates in urban and remote, and often inhospitable, areas around the world. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather, and mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war, civil unrest, piracy and acts of terrorism could result in the loss of hydrocarbons and associated revenues, environmental pollution or contamination, personal injury, including death, and property damages for which the Company could be deemed to be liable, and which could subject the Company to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages.\nThe location of many of Murphy\u2019s key assets causes the Company to be vulnerable to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms. A number of significant oil and natural gas fields lie in offshore waters around the world. Probably the most vulnerable of the Company\u2019s offshore fields are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where severe hurricanes and tropical storms have often led to shutdowns and damages. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November. Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K report, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured.\nIn addition, the Company has risks associated with cybersecurity attacks. Although the Company maintains processes and systems to monitor and avoid damages from security threats, there can be no assurance that such processes and systems will successfully avert such security breaches. A successful breach could lead to system disruptions, loss of data or unauthorized release of highly sensitive data. This could lead to property or environmental damages and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and costs.\nMurphy\u2019s commodity price risk management priorities may limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully benefit from potential future price increases for oil and natural gas.\nThe Company routinely enters into various contracts to protect its cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices. Because of these contracts, if the prices for oil and natural gas increase in future periods, the Company will not fully benefit from the price improvement on all of its production.\nMurphy\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to offset costs associated with certain events and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the future on terms that justify its purchase.\nMurphy maintains insurance against certain, but not all, hazards that could arise from its operations. The Company maintains liability insurance sufficient to cover its share of gross insured claim costs up to approximately $500 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. Generally, this insurance covers various types of third party claims related to personal injury, death and property damage, including claims arising from \u201csudden and accidental\u201d pollution events. The Company also maintains insurance coverage with an additional limit of $400 million per occurrence ($850 million for Gulf of Mexico operations not related to a named windstorm), all or part of which could be applicable to certain sudden and accidental pollution events. These policies have deductibles ranging from $10 million to $25 million. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nLawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company is involved in numerous lawsuits seeking cash settlements for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters. Certain of these lawsuits will take many years to resolve through court proceedings or negotiated settlements. None of the currently pending lawsuits are considered individually material or aggregate to a material amount in the opinion of management.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risks associated with sales of certain of its products to third parties and associated with its operating partners.\nAlthough Murphy limits its credit risk by selling its products to numerous entities worldwide, it still, at times, carries substantial credit risk from its customers. For certain oil and gas properties operated by the Company, other companies which own partial interests may not be able to meet their financial obligation to pay for their share of capital and operating costs as they come due. The inability of a purchaser of the Company\u2019s oil or natural gas or a partner of the Company to meet their respective payment obligations to the Company could have an adverse effect on Murphy\u2019s future earnings and cash flows.\nMurphy\u2019s operations could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency conversion rates.\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operational scope exposes it to risks associated with foreign currencies. Most of the Company\u2019s business is transacted in U.S. dollars, and therefore the Company and most of its subsidiaries are U.S. dollar functional entities for accounting purposes. However, the Canadian dollar is the functional currency for all Canadian operations [and the British pound is the functional currency for U.K. discontinued operations related to the Company\u2019s former downstream business]. In certain countries, such as Canada, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, significant levels of transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency. In Malaysia, such transactions include tax and other supplier payments, while in Canada, certain crude oil sales are priced in U.S. dollars. In late 2016, Malaysian authorities altered the local currency rules such that 75% of the proceeds of export oil and gas sales must be converted to local currency when received; plus, beginning in 2017, resident suppliers of goods and services to the Company must be paid in local currency. This exposure to currencies other than the functional currency can lead to significant impacts on consolidated financial results. Exposures associated with current and deferred income tax liability balances in Malaysia are generally not hedged. A strengthening of the Malaysian ringgit against the U.S. dollar would be expected to lead to currency losses in consolidated operations; gains would be expected if the ringgit weakens versus the dollar. Foreign exchange exposures between the U.S. dollar and the British pound are not hedged. The Company would generally expect to incur currency losses when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the British pound and would conversely expect currency gains when the U.S. dollar weakens against the pound. In Canada, currency risk is often managed by selling forward U.S. dollars to match the collection dates for crude oil sold in that currency. See Note L in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative contracts.\nThe costs and funding requirements related to the Company\u2019s retirement plans are affected by several factors.\nThe costs and funding requirements related to the Company\u2019s retirement plans are affected by several factors. A number of actuarial assumptions impact funding requirements for the Company\u2019s retirement plans. The most significant of these assumptions include return on assets, long-term interest rates and mortality. If the actual results for the plans vary significantly from the actuarial assumptions used, or if laws regulating such retirement plans are changed, Murphy could be required to make more significant funding payments to one or more of its retirement plans in the future and/or it could be required to record a larger liability for future obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.", "PERMNO": 28345, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MUR"}
