Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K or in Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 21 2016 FORM 10-K |\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K unless otherwise indicated.\nRisks Related to Ambac Common Shares\nInvestments in Ambac's common stock are highly speculative and the price per share of Ambac's common stock may be subject to a high degree of volatility, including significant price declines.\nAmbac's common stock, which was issued pursuant to its Reorganization Plan, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on May 1, 2013. Although Ambac's common stock is listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the trading market or the price at which such shares can be sold. The price of the shares may decline substantially in response to a number of events or circumstances, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nadverse developments in our financial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the actual or perceived risk within our insured portfolio;\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory status;\n\u2022\nchanges in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock;\n\u2022\nmarket trends unrelated to our stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy; and\n\u2022\nresults and actions of other participants in our industry.\nIn addition, the price of Ambac's shares may be affected by the additional risks described below, including risks associated with Ambac Assurance\u2019s ability to deliver value to Ambac. Investments in Ambac's common stock should be considered highly speculative and may be subject to a high degree of volatility.\nAmbac may not be able to realize value from Ambac Assurance or generate earnings apart from Ambac Assurance.\nBecause Ambac is a holding company, the value of its stock is dependent upon the residual value of its main operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance, the receipt of payments to be made by Ambac Assurance pursuant to the Amended TSA and the Cost Allocation Agreement, the receipt of payments on the Owner Trust Certificate issued to Ambac by Corolla Trust (the \"Owner Trust Certificate\"), the receipt of payments on investments made on securities issued or insured by Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account, and the receipt of dividends from Ambac Assurance. There can be no assurance that Ambac will be able to realize residual value in Ambac Assurance, which is in run-off. In addition, the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation is subject to rehabilitation proceedings and under the control of the Rehabilitator, as further described below. It is unclear whether Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account will be able to satisfy all of their respective obligations to policyholders, holders of their respective surplus notes and holders of Ambac Assurance\u2019s preferred stock, even if Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account are successful in achieving recoveries and mitigating losses. Our ability to achieve recoveries and mitigate losses is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including as a result of varying potential perceptions of the value of Ambac Assurance\u2019s guarantees and securities.\nDue to the above considerations, as well as applicable legal and contractual restrictions described elsewhere herein, it is highly unlikely that Ambac Assurance will be able to pay Ambac any dividends for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the payments to be made to Ambac under the Amended TSA and the Cost Allocation Agreement are subject to contingencies that are difficult to predict, making the amount and timing, if any, of such payments uncertain. Payments to be made under the Amended TSA, in particular, depend on the generation of future taxable income by Ambac Assurance above certain thresholds. Ambac Assurance\u2019s ability to generate taxable income above such thresholds is uncertain. Due to these factors, there can be no assurance as to the amounts that Ambac will receive from Ambac Assurance under the Amended TSA. Moreover, the Cost Allocation Agreement provides that Ambac Assurance's reimbursement of Ambac's operating expenses after 2017 is subject to the approval of the Rehabilitator and limited to $4.0 million per annum. We can provide no assurance as to whether the Rehabilitator will approve such reimbursement or any portion thereof.\nIt is also uncertain whether and to what extent Ambac will realize value from the Owner Trust Certificate. The Owner Trust Certificate is subordinated to $299.2 million of senior secured notes issued by Corolla Trust. Such notes and the Owner Trust Certificate are collateralized by and payable solely from a $350.0 million face amount Segregated Account junior surplus note plus interest thereon. No payment of interest on or principal of a Segregated Account junior surplus note may be made until all existing and future indebtedness of the Segregated Account, including Segregated Account surplus notes, policy claims and claims having statutory priority, and all existing and future senior ranking surplus notes, contribution notes or similar obligations of Ambac Assurance, have been paid in full. All payments of principal and interest on Segregated Account junior surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of OCI. If OCI does not approve the payment of interest on Segregated Account junior surplus notes, such interest will accrue and compound annually until paid. Payments on the senior secured notes issued by Corolla Trust will only be made when and to the extent that the Segregated Account makes payments on the junior surplus note held by Corolla Trust. The senior secured notes must be paid in full before any payments will be made on the Owner Trust Certificate. If Corolla Trust has failed to pay all interest and principal outstanding on the senior secured notes within three business days of August 28, 2039, the senior secured noteholders may also take possession of and sell the junior surplus note. If such a sale were to occur, it is uncertain whether and to what extent there would be any value for the Owner Trust Certificate after satisfaction of the senior secured notes.\nThe value of Ambac's common stock may also depend upon the ability of Ambac to generate earnings apart from Ambac Assurance. As noted below, Ambac is selectively exploring potential business opportunities that, among other things, may permit utilization of Ambac\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards, but there are no assurances regarding its ability to find or execute such business opportunities or the prospects of any such opportunities.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that rank senior to Ambac's common stock may adversely affect the market price of its common stock.\nIf Ambac decides to issue debt or additional equity securities in the future that rank senior to its common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 22 2016 FORM 10-K |\ncovenants restricting Ambac's operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities issued in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of common stock and may result in dilution to owners of common stock. Because Ambac's decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of future offerings. Holders of common stock bear the risk of future offerings reducing the market price of Ambac's common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in the Company.\nThe occurrence of certain events could result in the initiation of rehabilitation proceedings against Ambac Assurance, with resulting adverse consequences to holders of our securities.\nIncreased loss development in the General Account of Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account or significant losses or other events resulting from litigation against Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account may prompt OCI to determine that it is in the best interests of policyholders to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to Ambac Assurance, either preemptively or in response to any such event, and in addition to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings.\nIf, as a result of the occurrence of any such event(s), OCI decides to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to Ambac Assurance, adverse consequences may result, including, without limitation and absent enforceable protective injunctive relief, the assertion of damages by counterparties (including mark-to-market claims with respect to insured transactions executed in ISDA format), the acceleration of losses based on early termination triggers and the loss of control rights in insured transactions. Any such consequences may reduce the residual value of Ambac Assurance. Additionally, the Rehabilitator would assume control of all of Ambac Assurance\u2019s assets and management of Ambac Assurance. In exercising control, the Rehabilitator would act for the benefit of policyholders, and would not take into account the interests of our securityholders. Such actions may result in material adverse consequences for our securityholders.\nThe issuance of new common stock may dilute current shareholder value or have adverse effects on the market price of Ambac's common stock.\nIf Ambac raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock, whether for select business transactions, general corporate purposes, or in exchange for other securities, the value of current shareholders\u2019 interests may be diluted as Ambac is not required to offer any such shares to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis.\nAmbac cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of its common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for its common stock.\nRisks Related to Insured Portfolio Losses\nLoss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential losses; changes in loss reserves may result in further volatility of net income and comprehensive income.\nLoss reserves are established when management has observed credit deterioration, in most cases, when the underlying credit is considered below investment grade. Loss reserves established with\nrespect to our non-derivative financial guarantee insurance policies are based upon estimates and judgments by management, including estimates and judgments with respect to the probability of default, the severity of loss upon default, management\u2019s ability to execute policy commutations, and estimated remediation recoveries for, among other things, breaches by RMBS issuers of representations and warranties. Furthermore, the objective of establishing loss reserve estimates is not to, and our loss reserves do not, reflect the worst possible outcome. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, our loss reserves may change materially based on future developments. As a result of the inherent uncertainties in the estimates and judgments made to determine loss reserves, there can be no assurance that either the actual losses in our financial guarantee insurance portfolio will not exceed such reserves or that our reserves will not increase or decrease materially over time as circumstances, our assumptions, or our models change.\nAdditionally, inherent in our estimates of loss severities and remediation recoveries is the assumption that we will retain control rights in respect of our insured portfolio. However, according to the terms of relevant transaction documents, we may lose our control rights in many insured transactions if, among other things, we are the subject of delinquency proceedings and/or other regulatory actions which could result from our deteriorated financial position. If we lose control rights, our ability to mitigate loss severities and realize remediation recoveries will be compromised, and actual ultimate losses in our insured portfolio could exceed our loss reserves. The Rehabilitation Court issued an injunction restraining certain actions by holders of policies in the Segregated Account and other parties, including actions based on the loss of control rights. If this injunction does not successfully preclude such actions, Ambac Assurance could lose its control rights with respect to certain policies in the Segregated Account.\nSome issuers of public finance obligations we insure are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased losses on those obligations or increased liquidity claims, including losses or claims resulting from payment defaults, Chapter 9 bankruptcy or other restructuring proceedings or loss of market access.\nWe have historically experienced low levels of defaults in our public finance insured portfolio, including during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. However, some issuers of public finance obligations we insure continue to report budget shortfalls, significantly underfunded pensions or other fiscal stresses that will require them to significantly raise taxes and/or cut spending in order to satisfy their obligations. Government entities may also take other actions that may impact their own creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of related issuers. Some issuers of obligations we insure have declared a payment moratorium, defaulted or filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns about their ultimate ability to service the debt we insure and our ability to recover claims paid in the future. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, cut spending, or receive federal or state assistance, or if such issuers default or file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9, we may experience liquidity claims and/or ultimate losses on those obligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe insure obligations of several issuers that have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9. The consequences of such proceedings for creditors remain uncertain. For example, the\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 23 2016 FORM 10-K |\ntreatment of general obligation debt in relation to other obligations remains in flux, with Detroit's 2014 precedent unfavorable for debt creditors. If issuers succeed in materially adjusting their obligations to bondholders and financial guarantors, other issuers may be encouraged to default or file for Chapter 9 protection and seek similar adjustments to their debt. These events could materially increase losses in Ambac\u2019s insured portfolio of municipal credits.\nLoss of market access is a risk embedded in our municipal exposures. From time to time the municipal bond market evidences heightened investor concerns overall or for select sectors or issuers, as has been the case with Puerto Rico. Such adverse market conditions may trigger a loss of market liquidity for affected issuers, which in turn may significantly raise their cost of alternative financing or cause a liquidity crisis and potential for default on debt service payments we guarantee.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $2.1 billion of net par exposure to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, including its affiliates and public corporations. Components of Puerto Rico net par outstanding include capital appreciation bonds that are reported at the par amount at the time of issuance of the related insurance policy. The Commonwealth has announced that it cannot meet its obligations and that it intends to impair some or all of its creditors. In April 2016, the Commonwealth enacted the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act, which the then Governor of Puerto Rico invoked to, among other things, prevent the payment of debt service owed by several issuers. The Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have defaulted on a portion of their debt service payments, including payments owed on bonds insured by Ambac Assurance. Ambac Assurance may be required to make significant amounts of policy payments over the next several years, the recoverability of which is subject to great uncertainty, which may lead to material permanent losses. Our exposure to Puerto Rico is impacted by the Puerto Rico economy, which may be impacted by factors such as perceptions regarding its ability to maintain appropriate infrastructure standards. Given our exposure to Puerto Rico and the economic, legal and political uncertainties associated therewith, our loss reserves may ultimately prove to be insufficient to cover our losses, potentially by a material amount, and may be subject to material volatility.\nThe Commonwealth has proposed to restructure and renegotiate its obligations and those of certain of its affiliates and public corporations. Alternatives could be proposed or adopted that could significantly impair our exposures, including by failing to recognize or properly differentiate legal structures and protections applicable to such exposures, such that our loss reserves would need to be increased. In June 2016, the United States enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d). Among other things, PROMESA contains provisions that may permit consensual and non-consensual restructurings of debt obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities under the auspices of an oversight board created thereunder, subject to compliance with PROMESA. At this time, Ambac is unable to predict to what extent debt restructurings will be proposed or implemented under PROMESA, and what such restructurings or renegotiations would entail. PROMESA also contains a temporary stay on litigation, which has been extended to May 1, 2017, thus potentially limiting Ambac Assurance\u2019s ability to engage in loss mitigation. Litigation challenging the legal protections on which Ambac Assurance and its insured exposures rely is likely to intensify, which may materially increase our risk of\nloss. On October 7, 2016, certain holders of Puerto Rico\u2019s GO bonds requested leave of court to file an amended complaint that, among other things, challenges the structure of the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporations (\"COFINA\") and seeks injunctive relief requiring the sales and use tax proceeds securing the bonds issued by COFINA to be transferred to the Commonwealth treasury for payment of GO bonds. On October 26, 2016, Ambac filed a motion to intervene in that lawsuit in order to argue that the proposed claims are subject to PROMESA\u2019s litigation stay, and reserving the right to move to dismiss the claims should the Court determine they are not stayed. On February 17, 2017, the Court granted Ambac's motion to intervene and ruled that the claims challenging the COFINA structure are not subject to litigation stay. If successful, the GO plaintiffs\u2019 challenge against COFINA, and any similar claims that could be asserted by other plaintiffs in the future, could have a significant negative impact on Ambac\u2019s liquidity, loss reserves and capital resources. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, there could be material variability in our loss reserves for the foreseeable future given the fluid and unpredictable situation concerning the debts of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities.\nWe are subject to credit risk and other risks in our insured portfolio, including related to RMBS and securities backed by student loans. We are also subject to risks associated with adverse selection as our insured portfolio runs off. Measures taken to reduce such risks may have an adverse effect on operating results or financial position.\nPerformance of our insured transactions, including (but not limited to) RMBS transactions and those involving securities backed by student loans, can be adversely affected by general economic conditions, such as recession, rising unemployment rates, underemployment, home prices that decline or do not increase in the patterns assumed in our models, increasing foreclosure rates and unavailability of consumer credit, mortgage product attributes, such as interest rate adjustments and balloon payment obligations, borrower and/or originator fraud, mortgage and student loan servicer performance or underperformance and financial difficulty, such as risks related to whether the servicer may be required to delay the remittance of any cash collections held by it or received by it after the time it becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.\nWhile further deterioration in the performance of consumer assets, including mortgage-related assets and student loans, may occur, the timing, extent and duration of any future deterioration of the credit markets is unknown, as is the impact on potential claim payments and ultimate losses on the securities within Ambac Assurance\u2019s portfolio. In addition, there can be no assurance that any governmental or private sector initiatives designed to address such credit deterioration in the markets will be successful or inure to the benefit of the transactions we insure. For example, any initiative which permits the discharge of student loan debt in bankruptcy may adversely affect our portfolio. Similarly, servicer settlements with governmental authorities regarding foreclosure or servicing irregularities are generally designed to protect borrowers and may increase losses on securities we insure. In particular, the student loan industry has been subject to heightened Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) scrutiny over servicing and collections practices and, consequently, any settlements resulting from this scrutiny could lead to increased losses on securities we insure.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 24 2016 FORM 10-K |\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that we would be successful, or that we would not be delayed, in enforcing the subordination provisions, credit enhancements or other contractual provisions of the RMBS that Ambac Assurance insures.\nAs the runoff of the insured portfolio continues, the proportion of exposures we rate as below investment grade relative to the aggregate insured portfolio is likely to continue to increase, leaving the portfolio increasingly concentrated in higher risk exposures. This risk may result in greater volatility or have adverse effects on our results from operations and on our financial condition.\nOne of our primary goals is to create shareholder value through transaction terminations, policy commutations, settlements and restructurings that we believe will improve our risk profile. As we take such actions to reduce known and potential risks, such actions may negatively impact our operating results or financial position in one or more reporting periods.\nOur credit risk management policies and practices may not adequately identify significant risks.\nAs described in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRisk Management\u201d in this Form 10-K, we have established risk management policies and practices which seek to mitigate our exposure to credit risk in our insured portfolio. Ongoing surveillance of credit risks in our insured portfolio is an important component of our risk management. These policies and practices in the past have not insulated us from risks that were unforeseen and which had unanticipated loss severity, and such policies and practices may not do so in the future. There can be no assurance that these policies and practices will be adequate to avoid future losses. If we are not able to identify significant risks, we may not be able to timely remediate such risks, thereby increasing the amount of losses to which we are exposed. An inability to identify significant risks could also result in the failure to establish loss reserves that are sufficient in relation to such risks.\nWe use analytical models to assist our projection of performance of our insured obligations and our investment portfolio but actual results could differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.\nWe rely on internally and externally developed complex financial models, including default models related to RMBS and waterfall modeling provided by a nationally recognized vendor for RMBS and student loan exposures, to project performance of our insured obligations and related securities in our investment portfolio. These models assume various conditions, probability scenarios, facts and circumstances, and there can be no assurance that such models accurately predict or measure the quantum of losses, loss reserves and timing of losses. Differences in the models that we employ, and/or uncertainties and/or flaws in these financial models and/or faulty assumptions inherent in these financial models and those determined by management, could lead to material changes in projected outcomes, and could include increased losses, loss reserves and/or other than temporary investment impairments. Moreover, modeled estimates of transaction performance depend in part on our interpretations of contracts and other bases of our legal rights. Such interpretations may prove to be incorrect or different interpretations may be employed by bond trustees and other transaction participants and, ultimately courts, which could lead to increased losses, loss reserves and/or investment impairments.\nPotential outcome of litigation relating to certain military housing credit exposures could adversely affect Ambac.\nAmbac Assurance is a party to a number of litigations relating to military housing securitization credits, where opposing parties contend that, among other things, Ambac Assurance has lost its control rights due to the existence of an \u201cAmbac Default\u201d caused by, among other things, the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. If Ambac Assurance is found to have lost control rights in these transactions, our ability to mitigate losses could be significantly compromised, and actual ultimate losses in these military housing transactions could exceed our current loss reserves. Moreover, an adverse outcome relating to the assertion of an \u201cAmbac Default\u201d could prompt other counterparties to make similar assertions, which would increase the risk of losing control rights in other transactions.\nRisk Related to Segregated Account Rehabilitation\nActions of the Rehabilitator could adversely affect Ambac, including impacting our ability to realize our remediation recoveries.\nAs a consequence of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings, the Rehabilitator retains operational control and decision-making authority with respect to all matters related to the Segregated Account, including surveillance, remediation, loss mitigation and efforts to recover losses in the Segregated Account, including recovery efforts in respect of breaches of representations and warranties by sponsors of Ambac-insured RMBS. Similarly, by virtue of the contracts executed between Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account in connection with the establishment, and subsequent rehabilitation, of the Segregated Account, the Rehabilitator retains the discretion to oversee and approve certain actions taken by Ambac Assurance in respect of assets and liabilities that remain in Ambac Assurance. Moreover, the Rehabilitator retains the sole discretion to adjust claim payments, to make payments on Deferred Amounts and, with regulatory approval, to make payments on or redeem Segregated Account surplus notes (which would require Ambac Assurance to make proportionate payments on or proportionately redeem its surplus notes). As a result, certain efforts to remediate losses, and certain other actions taken by Ambac Assurance, are subject to the approval of the Rehabilitator, as are decisions about the timing of payments of significant liabilities of the Segregated Account. In exercising such authority, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of our securityholders. Decisions made by the Rehabilitator for the benefit of policyholders may result in material adverse consequences for our securityholders. In addition, we are not able to predict the impact such decisions will have on the remediation of losses, and, in particular, on our efforts to recover losses attributable to breaches of representations and warranties by sponsors of Ambac-insured RMBS, our ability to commute outstanding policies and purchase insured bonds or surplus notes, or how vigorously the Rehabilitator will pursue risk remediation in general. We are similarly unable to predict the decisions of the Rehabilitator as to claims payments or payments on Deferred Amounts or, with regulatory approval, payments on or redemptions of Segregated Account surplus notes, the timing and impact of which may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any negative consequences resulting from payments on or redemptions of Segregated Account surplus notes would be magnified due to the fact that the Rehabilitator\u2019s decision to make such payments would, as a result of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2010\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 25 2016 FORM 10-K |\n(the \"Settlement Agreement\"), by and among Ambac Assurance, Ambac Credit Products LLC (\u201cACP\u201d), Ambac and certain counterparties to credit default swaps with ACP that were guaranteed by Ambac Assurance, require Ambac Assurance to make proportionate payments on its surplus notes.\nChanges to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan could adversely affect the holders of securities issued or insured by Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account.\nThe Rehabilitator retains discretion to pursue modifications to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan, subject to the approval of the Rehabilitation Court. Such modifications could include, among others, an adjustment to the rate of accretion on Deferred Amounts, which the Rehabilitator has stated is under review. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on the interests of holders, or a subset of holders, of securities issued or insured by Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account.\nIntercompany disputes or disputes with OCI may arise, which may have material adverse effects on the Company.\nThe Segregated Account, Ambac Assurance, Ambac and other affiliates have entered into agreements that govern certain activities of such entities. OCI has certain enforcement rights with respect to such agreements and, as regulator of Ambac Assurance and as Rehabilitator of the Segregated Account, has further authority over the activities of Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account. Disputes may arise over the interpretation of such agreements, the exercise or purported exercise of rights thereunder, or the performance of or failure or purported failure to perform obligations thereunder. Disputes may also arise over certain actions taken or proposed to be taken by OCI in reliance on its contractual or legal rights or in reaction to actions taken or to be taken by the Company. In taking such actions or reacting to actions or decisions of the Company, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of our securityholders. Any such dispute could have material adverse effects on the Company, whether through litigation, failure to execute transactions sought by management, interference with corporate strategies, objectives or prerogatives, inefficient decision-making or execution, forced realignment of resources, increased costs, distractions to management, strained working relationships or otherwise. Such effects would also increase the risk that OCI would seek to initiate rehabilitation proceedings against Ambac Assurance.\nRisks Related to Capital, Liquidity and Markets\nOur inability to realize the expected recoveries included in our financial statements could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have estimated representation and warranty subrogation recoveries of $1,878.7 million (net of reinsurance) included in our financial statements. These recoveries are based on contractual claims arising from RMBS transactions that we have insured, and represent a probability-weighted estimate of amounts we expect to recover under various possible scenarios, and do not represent the best or the worst possible outcomes with respect to any particular transaction or group of transactions. Our ability to recover these amounts and the time of the recoveries, if any, is subject to significant uncertainty, including risks inherent in litigation, collectability of such amounts from counterparties and/or their respective parents and affiliates, timing of receipt of any such recoveries, intervention by OCI or the Rehabilitator which could impede our ability to take the actions required to realize such\nrecoveries, and uncertainties inherent in the assumptions used in estimating such recoveries. The amount of these subrogation recoveries is significant and if we were unable to recover such amounts, our stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2016 would decrease from $1,978.0 million to $99.3 million.\nWe expect to recover material amounts of claims payments through remediation measures including the litigation described above as well as through cash flows in the securitization structures of transactions that we insure. Realization of such expected recoveries is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the rights and defenses of other parties with interests that conflict with our interests, the performance of the collateral and assets backing the obligations that we insure, the performance of servicers involved in securitizations in which we participate as insurer, and the effect on our rights of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Plan and orders of the Rehabilitation Court. Additionally, the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings may impair our ability to realize recoveries in insured transactions if orders of the Rehabilitation Court are not effective.\nAdverse developments with respect to such variables may cause our recoveries to fall below expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to successfully monetize assets, restructure or exchange certain outstanding debt and insurance obligations, or commute or reduce insured exposures.\nAmbac Assurance is evaluating the possibility of entering into one or more transactions to improve the financial condition of Ambac Assurance which may, subject to OCI approval, lead to the conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. In pursuing this objective, Ambac Assurance is considering the possibility of monetizing certain assets, restructuring or exchanging certain outstanding debt and insurance obligations, and/or commuting or reducing insured exposures. Transactions of this nature may not be feasible or economically viable. We cannot provide any assurance that any such transaction will be consummated by Ambac Assurance in the future, or if it is, as to the timing, terms or conditions of any such transaction, or as to whether it could lead to the conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. OCI has not indicated a course of action to address Segregated Account or other obligations or to conclude the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. The terms, conditions, and timing of a potential conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings are in the sole discretion of OCI, and subject to the approval of the Rehabilitation Court. This discretion includes the authority to address Segregated Account obligations without the agreement of Ambac Assurance or its board of directors. Even if Ambac Assurance consummates one or more such transactions, doing so may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful in creating value for any or all of our stakeholders and may adversely affect our operating results or financial position. Moreover, any such transaction would be subject to the prior approval of the board of directors of Ambac Assurance, OCI and the Rehabilitation Court and may require third-party consents, which may not be obtained.\nThe Rehabilitator recently filed with the Rehabilitation Court a supplement to his 2016 Annual Report dated June 1, 2016 relating to the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings (the \u201cSupplement\u201d). In the Supplement, the Rehabilitator stated that at the present time and absent further actions, Ambac Assurance\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 26 2016 FORM 10-K |\nhas insufficient capital to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Rehabilitator that the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings could be concluded and leave Ambac Assurance with sufficient financial resources to meet all policy obligations, as projected by the Rehabilitator (in his sole discretion) under a varying range of base and stress case scenarios. The Rehabilitator further stated in the Supplement that given such requirements, any transaction facilitating the conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings will need to provide for an increase in Ambac Assurance\u2019s existing surplus capital, as determined and defined by OCI in its sole discretion. We cannot provide assurance that the terms of any possible transaction will satisfy OCI or the Rehabilitator that Ambac Assurance has, or will have, sufficient capital to meet all policy obligations after the conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. The terms, conditions, and timing of a potential conclusion of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings are in the sole discretion of OCI, and subject to the approval of the Rehabilitation Court. Even if the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings could be brought to a successful conclusion, there can be no assurance that any level of capital deemed sufficient by OCI to permit such conclusion will be sufficient to cover all future losses, whether currently anticipated or unanticipated.\nRevenues and cash flow would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, Ambac Assurance has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by Ambac Assurance could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations or insufficiency of cash flows (by the premium paying entity). Additionally, the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings may result in the loss of installment premium income from such insured transactions if orders of the Rehabilitation Court are not effective. Such reductions would result in lower revenues.\nThe change in composition of the securities in our investment portfolio exposes us to greater risk.\nEach of Ambac Assurance and Ambac Assurance UK Limited (\u201cAmbac UK\u201d) maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in lower-rated securities and/or \u201calternative assets\u201d in order to increase the risk-adjusted return on its portfolio. Investments in lower-rated securities and \u201calternative assets\u201d could expose Ambac and/or Ambac UK to greater earnings volatility, increased losses and decreased liquidity in the investment portfolio.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operational flexibility and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations as well as the performance of our insured portfolio, which is driven to an extent by events outside our control, increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due, in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial debt and events outside our control could also have other significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, payment of policyholder claims, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and to fund the execution of our key strategies;\n\u2022\nlimit or restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability or increase the costs to refinance indebtedness or ever repay such indebtedness due to ongoing interest accretion;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to attract and retain key employees; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions, as well as the volume of those transactions.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt. While restrictive covenants in certain of our contracts currently provide limits on the amount of additional indebtedness Ambac Assurance may incur, we may obtain a waiver of those restrictions and incur additional indebtedness in the future. In addition, if Ambac incurred indebtedness, it would depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to it so that Ambac could pay its obligations and expenses, including satisfying its indebtedness. Ambac\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on, or refinance, any such indebtedness would depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to made distributions or dividends, which in turn will depend on their future operating performance and legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions or dividends to which they may be subject. There can be no assurance that any such dividends or distributions would be made. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nThe determination of the amount of other-than temporary impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. In particular, we use externally developed financial models to project impairments with respect to RMBS held in our investment portfolio, including Ambac Assurance guaranteed RMBS. Differences in the models we employ and/or flaws in these models and/or faulty assumptions inherent in these models and those determined by management, could lead to increased impairments with respect to RMBS in our investment portfolio.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 27 2016 FORM 10-K |\nRisks Related to the Financial and Credit Markets\nChanges in prevailing interest rate levels and market conditions could adversely impact our business results and prospects.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. In the event that investments must be sold in order to pay claims, to pay Deferred Amounts, to redeem surplus notes, or to meet Financial Services liquidity needs due to contract terminations or collateral posting requirements, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Additionally, increasing interest rates would have an adverse impact on our insured portfolio. For example, increasing interest rates could result in higher claim payments in respect of defaulted obligations that bear interest at floating rates of interest. Higher interest rates can also lead to increased credit stress on consumer asset-backed transactions (as the securitized assets supporting a portion of these exposures are floating rate consumer obligations), slower prepayment speeds and resulting \u201cextension risk\u201d relative to such consumer asset-backed transactions in our insured and investment portfolios, and decreased refinancing activity.\nDecreasing interest rates could result in early terminations of financial guarantee insurance policies in respect of which we are paid on an installment basis and do not receive a termination premium, thus reducing premium earned for these transactions. Decreases in prevailing interest rates may also limit growth of or reduce investment income and may adversely impact our interest rate swap portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by credit rating downgrades, ABS and RMBS prepayment speeds, foreign exchange movements, spread volatility, and credit losses.\nWe are subject to credit risk throughout our businesses, including large single risks, risk concentrations, correlated risks and reinsurance counterparty credit risk.\nWe are exposed to the risk that issuers of debt which we have insured (or with respect to which we have written credit derivatives), issuers of debt which we hold in our investment portfolio, reinsurers and other contract counterparties (including derivative counterparties) may default in their financial obligations, whether as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. These credit risks could cause increased losses and loss reserves, and/or estimates of credit impairments and mark-to-market losses with respect to credit derivatives in our financial guarantee business; and we could experience losses and decreases in the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. Such credit risks may be in the form of large single risk exposures to particular issuers, reinsurers or counterparties; losses caused by catastrophic events (including terrorist acts and natural disasters); losses caused by increases in municipal defaults; or losses in respect of different, but correlated, credit exposures.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory inquiries or investigations, and the outcome of proceedings we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nAmbac Assurance is defending various lawsuits relating to its financial guarantee business. Ambac is defending a putative securities class action lawsuit. In addition, the Company from time to time receives various regulatory inquiries and requests for\ninformation. Please see Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for information on these various proceedings.\nIt is not possible to predict whether additional suits will be filed or whether additional regulatory inquiries or requests for information will be made, and it is also not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, inquiries or requests for information. It is possible that there could be unfavorable outcomes in these or other proceedings. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from unfavorable outcomes or of the expenses that will be incurred in defending these lawsuits. Under some circumstances, adverse results in any such proceedings and/or the incurring of significant litigation expenses could be material to our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nThe Settlement Agreement contains restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ambac Assurance must seek prior approval by OCI of certain corporate actions. The Settlement Agreement also includes covenants which generally restrict the operations of Ambac Assurance and remain in force until the surplus notes that were issued to the counterparties by Ambac Assurance pursuant to the Settlement Agreement have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full. Certain of these restrictions may be waived with the approval of a majority of Unaffiliated Qualified Directors (as defined in the Settlement Agreement), certain holders of our surplus notes and/or OCI. If we are unable to obtain the required consents under the Settlement Agreement, we may not be able to execute our planned business strategies.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for many enterprise-critical functions and a prolonged failure or interruption of these systems for any reason could cause significant disruption to our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our information technology and application systems may be vulnerable to threats from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. Computer hackers may be able to penetrate our network\u2019s system security and misappropriate or compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition to our own confidential information, we sometimes receive and are required to protect confidential information from third parties. To the extent any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or that of others, it could cause significant financial losses that are either not, or not fully, insured against, damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with third parties, lead to claims against us, result in regulatory action, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to mitigate the damage caused by any security breach, or to protect against future damage. Moreover, although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion in the event of a disruption to our information technology and application systems.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 28 2016 FORM 10-K |\nWe may incur losses resulting from operational risk due to inadequate or failed internal processes, breakdown of settlement or communication systems, or from external events leading to disruption of our business. Events subject to operational risk include:\n\u2022\nInternal Fraud-misappropriation of assets, intentional mismarking of positions\n\u2022\nExternal Fraud-theft of information, third-party theft and forgery\n\u2022\nClients, Products, & Business Practice-improper trade, fiduciary breaches\n\u2022\nDamage to Physical Assets\n\u2022\nBusiness Disruption & System Failures-software failures, hardware failures; and\n\u2022\nExecution, Delivery, & Process Management-data entry errors, accounting errors, failed mandatory reporting, settlement errors, and negligence.\nWe may be adversely affected by failures in services or products provided by third parties.\nWe have outsourced and may continue to outsource certain segments of our operations and business, and rely upon third-party vendors for other essential services and information, such as the provision of data used in setting loss reserves and the provision of risk management information and services. A material failure by an external service or information provider or a material defect in the products, services or information provided thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees or the loss of any of these personnel could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies depend on the retention and recruitment of qualified executives and other professionals. We rely substantially upon the services of our current executive team. In addition to these officers, we require key staff with risk mitigation, structured finance, insurance, credit, investment, accounting, finance, legal and technical skills. As a result of Ambac\u2019s financial situation and the rehabilitation proceedings for the Segregated Account, there is a higher risk that executive officers and other key staff will leave the Company and replacements may not be motivated to join the Company. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or our inability to hire and retain other talented personnel could delay or prevent us from succeeding in executing our strategies, which could further negatively impact our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected by actions of stakeholders whose interests may not be aligned with the broader interests of our stockholders.\nAmbac could be negatively affected as a result of actions by stakeholders whose interests may not be aligned with the broader interests of our stockholders, and responding to any such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt operations and divert the attention of management and employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute on our strategic plans.\nRisks Related to International Business\nActions of the PRA and FCA could reduce the value of Ambac UK realizable by Ambac, which could adversely affect our securityholders.\nAmbac\u2019s international business is operated by Ambac UK, which is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (\u201cPRA\u201d) for prudential purposes and the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) for conduct purposes. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\u201cFSMA\u201d), the PRA authorized Ambac UK to carry out financial guaranty insurance business in the UK and in the EU by way of the EU\u2019s passporting regime (although this may change following Brexit), subject to the terms and conditions of the permission granted by the PRA and consented to by the FCA. However, the terms of Ambac UK\u2019s regulatory authority are now restricted and Ambac UK is in run-off. Among other things, Ambac UK may not write any new business, and, with respect to any entity within the Ambac group of affiliates, commute, vary or terminate any existing financial guaranty policy, transfer certain assets, or pay dividends, without the prior approval of the PRA and FCA. The PRA and FCA act generally in the interests of Ambac UK policyholders and will not take into account the interests of securityholders of Ambac or Ambac Assurance when considering whether to provide any such approval. Accordingly, determinations made by the PRA and FCA, in their capacity as Ambac UK\u2019s regulator, could potentially result in adverse consequences for our securityholders and also reduce the value realizable by Ambac for Ambac UK.\nRegulatory uncertainty in relation to Ambac UK\u2019s capital position could adversely affect the value of Ambac UK and affect our securityholders.\nUnder applicable regulatory capital rules (\u201cSolvency II\u201d) Ambac UK remains significantly deficient in terms of capital. Ambac UK does not have a remedial plan other than to build its assets over time by on-going premium collections and earned investment income, as well as attempting to accelerate the run-off of its exposures. Further, there currently is no prospect of any capital support from the Ambac group of affiliates. The PRA is well aware of Ambac UK\u2019s position and prospects. The PRA supervisory statement SS7/15 \u201cSupervision of firms in difficulty or run-off\u201d notes that \u201cthere are many circumstances in which a run-off strategy is in the best interests of policyholders\u201d and notes that the PRA will review such firms and that they \u201cmay be permitted to continue activities necessary to carry out existing contracts in a manner, and for so long as, the PRA considers necessary in order to afford an appropriate degree of protection to policyholders\u201d. AUK clearly falls into this category and therefore AUK\u2019s current run off approach remains at all times subject to the continuing forbearance of the PRA in relation to its capital deficit and related Solvency II requirements. Alternative courses of action open to the PRA could adversely impact the anticipated run-off trajectory of Ambac UK and impact its value.\nUncertainty regarding the economic impact of \u201cBrexit\u201d may have an adverse effect on Ambac\u2019s insured international portfolio and the value of its foreign investments, both of which primarily reside with its subsidiary Ambac UK.\nIn a non-binding referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u201d) membership in the European Union in June 2016, a majority of those who voted approved the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). As a result of the referendum, the British government has announced that it intends to commence negotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and of its future\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 29 2016 FORM 10-K |\nrelationship with the EU in March 2017, with the expectation of withdrawing two years later. The terms of the future relationship between the EU and the UK are uncertain at this time and may be so for some time to come, and could result in the UK losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The Brexit vote, subsequent uncertainty, and the perceptions as to the ultimate impact of the withdrawal of the UK may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) the risk that one or more other EU countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the EU, (ii) the risk of a greater demand for independence by Scottish nationalists or for unification in Ireland and its impact on the United Kingdom, or (iii) the risk that the Euro as the single currency of the Eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on economic growth or business activity in the UK, the Eurozone, and/or the EU, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, the availability of credit, political systems or financial institutions and the financial and monetary system.\nThese economic conditions, particularly a recession or depression, may have a material adverse effect on Ambac\u2019s international insured exposures particularly in the UK and Europe, the majority of which reside in Ambac UK. The creditworthiness of Ambac\u2019s international insured exposures is subject to risks associated with, among other matters, lower asset values related to collateral backing transactions, depressed demand for services resulting in lower operating cash flows and reduced access to the capital markets and other sources of financing or refinancing. In addition, such conditions may have a material adverse effect on the value and volatility of investments, including investments in UK property funds and equities that Ambac maintains, mainly through Ambac UK, in markets and currencies outside of the U.S. Collectively, these effects may have a negative impact on Ambac\u2019s operating results and financial condition resulting from unexpected credit, investment and foreign exchange losses, volatile asset values, reduced liquidity and lost revenues.\nThe uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the Brexit could result in additional volatility in the equity, foreign exchange, real property, bond and other markets, which could adversely impact the UK economy and Ambac's results of operations and financial condition over the near and long term.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nCertain surplus notes or other obligations issued by either Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance and as a result, Ambac Assurance may no longer be a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which Ambac is the common parent.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations issued by either Ambac Assurance or the Segregated Account may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance that is taken into account for tax affiliation purposes and it is determined that such \u201cequity\u201d represented more than twenty percent of the total value of the stock of Ambac Assurance, Ambac Assurance may no longer be characterized as an includable corporation that is affiliated with Ambac. As a result, Ambac Assurance would no longer be\ncharacterized as a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which Ambac is the common parent (the \u201cAmbac Consolidated Group\u201d) and Ambac Assurance would be required to file a separate consolidated tax return as the common parent of a new U.S. federal income tax consolidated group including Ambac Assurance as the new common parent and Ambac Assurance\u2019s affiliated subsidiaries (the \u201cAmbac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group\u201d).\nTo the extent Ambac Assurance is no longer a member of the Ambac Consolidated Group, Ambac Assurance\u2019s NOLs (and certain other available tax attributes of Ambac Assurance and the other members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group) may no longer be available for use by the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group or any of the remaining members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group to reduce the U.S. federal income tax liabilities of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group. Ambac, Ambac Assurance and their affiliates entered into a tax sharing agreement that would require Ambac to make certain tax elections that could mitigate the loss of NOLs and other tax attributes resulting from a deconsolidation of Ambac Assurance from the Ambac Consolidated Group. However, in the event of a deconsolidation, certain other benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to the Ambac Consolidated Group including certain favorable rules relating to transactions occurring between members of the Ambac Consolidated Group and members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group.\nIf surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance, the Ambac Assurance NOLs (and certain other tax attributes or tax benefits of the Ambac Consolidated Group) may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Tax Code.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations may be characterized as equity of Ambac Assurance for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d of Ambac Assurance for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. If such an ownership change were to occur, the value and amount of the Ambac Assurance NOLs would be substantially impaired, increasing the U.S. federal income tax liability of Ambac Assurance and materially reducing the value of Ambac Assurance\u2019s stock owned by Ambac and the potential of future cash tolling or dividend payments from Ambac Assurance to Ambac.\nDeductions with respect to interest accruing on certain surplus notes may be eliminated or deferred until payment.\nTo the extent certain surplus notes are characterized as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, accrued interest will not be deductible by Ambac Assurance. In addition, even if such surplus notes are characterized as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deduction of interest accruing on such surplus notes may be deferred until paid or eliminated in part depending upon (i) the terms of any deferral and payment provisions provided in such surplus notes, (ii) whether such surplus notes have \u201csignificant original issue discount,\u201d and (iii) the yield to maturity of surplus notes. To the extent deductions with respect to interest are eliminated or deferred, the U.S. federal income tax of the members of the Ambac Consolidated Group or the members of the Ambac Assurance Consolidated Tax Group as the case may be, could be increased reducing the amount of cash available to pay its obligations.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 30 2016 FORM 10-K |\nChanges in Political or Economic Conditions\nNew U.S. Administration\u2019s proposed tax reform may have adverse consequences for the Company.\nThe recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could significantly impact our business and the insurance industry.\nIn particular, significant changes in the U.S. federal tax code are possible. One potential proposal is to reduce the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 15%. Any reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate will reduce the value of Ambac\u2019s and Ambac Assurance\u2019s NOLs. This potential loss of value includes the prospects of lower tolling payments to be made by Ambac Assurance to Ambac. In addition, the effects of lower corporate tax rates, when coupled with other economic expectations (such as higher inflation) may adversely impact the pricing and valuation of fixed-income securities, including those in our investment portfolio.\nA reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rates may also adversely affect municipal issuers\u2019 funding costs and market access. A lower corporate tax rate could make tax-exempt indebtedness issued by municipal issuers less attractive, possibly resulting in a re-pricing of the municipal bond market. Any such re-pricing may result in lower re-fundings of our municipal exposures than projected, and/or increased losses in our municipal credit portfolio.\nIn addition, there can be no certainty that the proposed tax reforms will not also limit or abolish the income tax exemption for municipal bond interest. Such a reform could potentially place further stress on municipal issuers\u2019 ability to fund their operations, with the potential for increased defaults on debt service payments.\nWe are also currently unable to predict whether other reform discussions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant for our business, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Strategic Plan\nAmbac is exploring select business opportunities which may permit utilization of Ambac\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards; however, such business opportunities may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not create value and may negatively impact our financial results.\nAmbac is exploring select business opportunities which may permit utilization of its net operating loss carry-forwards. Such business opportunities, may involve the acquisition of assets or existing businesses or the development of businesses through new or existing subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time to predict the future prospects or other characteristics of any such business opportunities. Although we intend to conduct business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of any future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. Efforts to pursue select business opportunities may be unsuccessful or require significant financial\nor other resources, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition. No assurance can be given that Ambac will be able to complete such business opportunities, generate any earnings or be able to successfully integrate any such business into our current operating structure.\nMoreover, Ambac\u2019s ability to enter new businesses, including new businesses apart from Ambac Assurance, is also subject to significant doubt, given the condition and circumstances of the Segregated Account and Ambac Assurance, the difficulty of leveraging or monetizing Ambac\u2019s other assets, and the uncertainty of its ability to raise capital. Due to these factors, as well as those relating to Ambac Assurance as described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, the value of our securities is highly speculative.\nAmbac\u2019s current strategy and initiatives have been derived from, and created as a consequence of, the company\u2019s current financial condition and circumstances. Should changes in Ambac\u2019s circumstances or financial condition or in the political, economic and/or legal environment occur, there can be no assurances that all or any part of such strategy and/or initiatives will not be abandoned or amended to take account of such changes. Any such adjustment or abandonment may have an adverse effect on our securities.", "PERMNO": 76757, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "AMBC"}
