RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves significant risks. Before investing, carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are the ones we believe may materially affect us. However, there may be others of which we are unaware that could materially harm our business or financial condition and cause the price of our stock to decline, in which case you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Commercial Activities\nFailure to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of Korlym would harm our financial results and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nOur ability to generate revenue and to fund our commercial operations and development programs is dependent on the sale of Korlym to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Physicians will prescribe Korlym only if they determine that it is preferable to other treatments, even if those treatments are not approved for Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Because Cushing\u2019s syndrome is rare, most physicians are inexperienced diagnosing or caring for patients with the illness and it can be hard to persuade them to identify appropriate patients and treat them with Korlym.\nMany factors could limit our Korlym revenue, including:\n\u2022\nthe preference of some physicians for off-label treatments for Cushing\u2019s syndrome, such as ketoconazole;\n\u2022\ncompetition from non-medical treatments, such as surgery and radiation;\n\u2022\nthe potential introduction of a competitor for Korlym, including a generic version of Korlym;\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability of adequate private and government insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and political concerns about Korlym\u2019s active ingredient, mifepristone, which is approved in another drug for the termination of pregnancy; and\n\u2022\ntechnological change that makes Korlym obsolete.\nFailure to generate sufficient Korlym revenue may prevent us from fully funding our planned commercial and clinical activities and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nIf generic versions of Korlym are approved and successfully commercialized, our business, results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.\nThe marketing exclusivity provided by Korlym\u2019s orphan drug designation expired in February 2019. Other companies may now seek to introduce generic equivalents of Korlym for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, provided they receive FDA approval and can show that their products do not infringe patents we hold covering Korlym\u2019s use to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome or that these patents are invalid or unenforceable. If our patents are successfully challenged and a generic version of Korlym becomes available, our sales of Korlym tablets and their price could decline rapidly and significantly, which would reduce our revenue and materially harm our results of operations and financial position. Competition from a generic version of Korlym may also cause our revenue to be materially less than the public guidance we have provided, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have sued Teva and Sun in Federal District Court with respect to their proposed generic versions of Korlym. Litigation to enforce or defend intellectual property rights is complex, costly and involves significant commitments of management time. There can be no assurance of a successful outcome. Please see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d Furthermore, on August 1, 2020, after the 30-month stay provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act has expired, Teva may choose to market a generic version of Korlym, notwithstanding any ongoing litigation with us. Even if we prevail in our legal action and Teva withdraws its product and pays us damages, the temporary availability of a generic version of Korlym could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther companies offer or are attempting to develop different medications to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The availability of competing treatments could limit our revenue from Korlym.\nSince 2012, a medication developed by Novartis and now owned by the Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati, the somatostatin analogue Signifor\u00ae (pasireotide) Injection, has been marketed in both the United States and the EU for adult patients with Cushing\u2019s disease (a subset of Cushing\u2019s syndrome). Recordati is also developing the cortisol synthesis inhibitor osilodrostat to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Osilodrostat has been designated an orphan drug for that indication in both the EU and the United States. The EU\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended that osilodrostat be approved in the EU for the treatment of endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Recordati has announced that it also plans to seek marketing approval for osilodrostat in the United States.\nStrongbridge Biopharma plc (\u201cStrongbridge\u201d) has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of the cortisol synthesis inhibitor levoketoconazole to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Levoketoconazole is an enantiomer of the generic anti-fungal medication, ketoconazole, that is prescribed off-label to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Strongbridge has completed one Phase 3 trial, which met its primary endpoint of reducing cortisol synthesis, and is conducting a second Phase 3 trial.\nIf we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, we will be unable to generate significant revenues.\nThe commercial success of Korlym depends on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement. Government payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, as well as private insurers and health maintenance organizations, are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting reimbursement for medicines. If government or private payers cease to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, physicians may not prescribe the medication and patients may not purchase it, even if it is prescribed. In addition, delays in coverage for individual patients may reduce our revenues.\nIn some foreign markets, drug prices and the profitability of prescription medications are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. Also, the trends toward managed health care in the United States and recent laws and legislation intended to increase the public visibility of drug prices and reduce the cost of government and private insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for Korlym.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), which was passed in 2010, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The PPACA, among other things, expanded Medicaid program eligibility and access to commercial health insurance coverage, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. The PPACA also appropriated funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research, although it remains unclear how the research will affect Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payer policies.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, replace or repeal the PPACA will affect the law or our business. Any new limitations on, changes to, or uncertainty with respect to the ability of individuals to enroll in governmental reimbursement programs or other third-party payer insurance plans could reduce Korlym sales, which in turn could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products.\nOther legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2 percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from\nthree to five years. Moreover, the federal government and the individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in developing proposals, passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control drug pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, formulary flexibility, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nThese new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare-related measures that may be adopted in the future, could materially reduce our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nThe unfavorable public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to sell Korlym.\nThe active ingredient in Korlym, mifepristone, is approved by the FDA in another drug for the termination of early pregnancy. As a result, mifepristone is the subject of considerable debate in the United States and elsewhere. Public perception of mifepristone may limit the acceptance of Korlym by patients and physicians. Even though we have taken measures to minimize the chance that Korlym will accidentally be prescribed to a pregnant woman, physicians may choose not to prescribe Korlym to a woman simply to avoid the risk of terminating a pregnancy.\nWe depend on vendors to manufacture Korlym\u2019s active ingredient, form it into tablets, package it and dispense it to patients. We also depend on vendors to manufacture the API and capsules or tablets for our product candidates. If our suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform these functions and we cannot transfer these activities to replacement vendors in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\nA single third-party manufacturer, PCAS, supplies the API in Korlym. Two other third-party manufacturers produce and bottle Korlym tablets. Our agreement with PCAS automatically renews for two one-year terms, unless either party provides 12-months\u2019 written notice of its intent not to renew. A single specialty pharmacy, Optime Care, Inc. (\u201cOptime\u201d) dispenses the Korlym we sell directly to patients and collects payments from insurers and other payers representing approximately 99 percent of our revenue. If Optime does not adhere to its agreements with payers, it may not be able to collect some or all of the payments due to us. Our agreement with Optime has a five-year term and renews upon the written consent of both parties, subject to customary termination provisions. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for convenience.\nThe facilities used by our vendors to manufacture and package the API and drug product of Korlym and our product candidates must be approved by the FDA and, in some cases, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). We do not control the activities of these vendors, including whether they maintain adequate quality control and hire qualified personnel. We are dependent on them for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d). If our vendors cannot manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory authorizations for their facilities and we could be prohibited from using the API or drug product they have provided. If the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities withdraw regulatory authorizations of these facilities, we may need to find alternative vendors or facilities, which would be time-consuming, complex and expensive and could significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and market our products. Sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, refusal of regulators to approve our product candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may not have adequate insurance to cover our exposure to product liability claims.\nWe may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that Korlym or one of our product candidates has harmed a patient. Such a claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about Korlym or our product candidates\u2019 safety and could prevent or interfere with product development or commercialization. Less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are sometimes not known until long after the product is approved for marketing. Because the active ingredient in Korlym is used to terminate pregnancy, clinicians using Korlym in clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women must take strict precautions to ensure that it is not administered to pregnant women. Failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product liability claims.\nOur product liability insurance may not fully cover our liabilities. Inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage could inhibit development of our product candidates or result in significant uninsured liability. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and divert management from productive activities.\nIf we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome or if we fail to comply with other requirements, we will be unable to generate revenue and may be subject to penalties.\nWe are subject to oversight by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and elsewhere with respect to our research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and sales and marketing activities. These requirements include submissions of safety information, annual updates on manufacturing activities and continued compliance with FDA regulations, including cGMPs, good laboratory practices and good clinical practices\n(\u201cGCP\u201d). The FDA enforces these regulations through inspections of us and the laboratories, manufacturers and clinical sites we use. Foreign regulatory authorities have comparable requirements and enforcement mechanisms. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or product candidate, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or deficiencies in manufacturing processes or management, as well as failure to comply with FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, may subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, holds on clinical trials, product seizure, refusal to permit the import or export of products, restrictions on product marketing, withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental NDAs, and suspension or revocation of product approvals.\nWe cannot predict how government regulations may change. The Trump administration has taken actions that could impose significant burdens on or materially delay the FDA\u2019s ability to implement new rules, issue guidance and review and approve marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions will be implemented, if at all, and the extent to which they will affect the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its authority. If these executive actions impair the FDA\u2019s ability to carry out its regulatory responsibilities or if we are slow or unable to adapt to sudden changes in regulatory requirements, our regulatory compliance may lapse and we may lose marketing approval for Korlym or face enforcement action.\nWe may be subject to civil or criminal penalties if our marketing of Korlym violates FDA regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws.\nWe are subject to FDA regulations governing the promotion and sale of medications. Although physicians are permitted to prescribe drugs for any indication they choose, manufacturers may only promote products for their FDA-approved use. All other uses are referred to as \u201coff-label.\u201d In the United States, we market Korlym to treat hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and for whom surgery has failed or is not an option. We provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians covering the use of Korlym for this indication. The FDA may change its policies or enact new regulations at any time that restrict our ability to promote our products.\nAlthough we believe our marketing materials and training programs do not constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities by our employees or agents constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion, it could require us to change them. The FDA could also subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including issuance of a public \u201cwarning letter,\u201d injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. Other federal or state enforcement authorities might act if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may receive negative publicity, incur significant expenses and be forced to devote management time to defending our position.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse regulations, including:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to or entering into \u201csham\u201d consulting arrangements with customers to induce such customers to purchase, order or recommend the company\u2019s products in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws and regulations; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by certain governmental programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in the promotion of \u201coff-label\u201d uses that caused customers to submit claims to and obtain reimbursement from governmental payers for non-covered \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022, teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports detailing these financial arrangements by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information.\nThe risk of our operations being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under them, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers (some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products) and the manner in which we promote our products, could be subject to challenge. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors, and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Although we have policies and procedures prohibiting such activity, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct and the precautions we take may not be effective in controlling unknown risks or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, individual imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our financial results and ability to operate.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems or our failure to protect confidential information concerning patients or others could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe store valuable confidential information relating to our business, patients and employees on our computer networks and on the networks of our vendors. Despite the implementation of security measures, these networks are subject to the risk of cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and internet and electrical failures. They may also be manipulated by criminals seeking to commit fraud or theft. In addition, system failures could cause the loss or theft of valuable clinical trial data or otherwise disrupt our clinical and commercial activities and be expensive and time-consuming to remedy. If a disruption or security breach resulted in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed or otherwise harmed.\nWe are subject to government regulation and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. Compliance with these requirements is complex and costly. Failure to comply could materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to statutes concerning data privacy and security, including HIPAA and the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). These and other regulatory frameworks are evolving rapidly as new rules are enacted and existing ones updated and made more stringent.\nIn the United States, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon \u201ccovered entities\u201d (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an\naudit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C \u00a7 45(a). The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC\u2019s guidance for appropriately securing consumers\u2019 personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.\nIn addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For instance, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nThe GDPR took effect in 2018. It establishes new requirements for the use and safeguarding of personal data in the EU and applies to companies established in the EU as well as companies that collect and use personal data to offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the EU (including in clinical trials). Penalties for failure to comply include fines of up to \u20ac20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. Data protection authorities in some of the EU member states have not completed their interpretative guidance and implementing laws and regulations, which makes compliance with the GDPR difficult. In addition, data protection authorities of the different EU countries may interpret GDPR requirements differently. Once promulgated, national and EU guidance will likely be updated from time to time, which will add complexity and cost to our collection and handling of data. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the EU will be regulated, especially following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 without a deal. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.\nComplying with HIPAA, the GDPR and other data privacy and security requirements is complex and costly. Failure to comply by us or our vendors could subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions and substantial penalties and fines, which could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the continued functioning of the FDA and other federal instrumentalities. Inadequate funding of these instrumentalities, their partial or complete closure, or their inability to hire and retain talented professionals due to uncertainties about their ability to pay their employees could materially harm our business.\nThe FDA\u2019s ability to carry out its mandated functions is affected by a variety of factors, including adequate government funding, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may slow the time to review new drug applications and respond to other inquiries. Disruptions at the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) may temporarily stop its ability to review and approve proposed financing transactions. Several times in the last few years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down and many regulatory agencies, including the FDA and SEC, have had to furlough employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impair the FDA, SEC and other authorities' ability to process our submissions, which could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our patients pay for Korlym with insurance or other support provided by payers who are funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and the Veterans Administration. If a partial or total shutdown of the federal government prevents these payers from funding their obligations, our revenues could decline.\nChanges in federal, state and local tax laws may reduce our net earnings.\nOur earnings are subject to federal, state and local tax. We offset a portion of our earnings using net operating losses and our taxes using research and development tax credits, which reduces the amount of tax we pay. Some jurisdictions require that we pay taxes or fees calculated as a percentage of sales, payroll expense, or other indicia of our activities. Please see \u201cPart IV, Item 16, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Income Taxes.\u201d Changes to existing tax laws that we cannot control or predict could materially increase the amount of taxes and fees we must pay. For example, an increase in income tax rates or a reduction or\nelimination of net operating losses and research and development tax credits could significantly increase our tax expense, which would reduce our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nA disaster could damage our own or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage from various types of natural disasters or other disruptive events, including earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses and communications failures. Our headquarters are in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is earthquake-prone. Our specialty pharmacy and tablet manufacturer are in areas subject to hurricanes and tornadoes. Political considerations relating to mifepristone put us and our manufacturers at increased risk of protests and disruptive events. If a disaster were to occur, we might not be able to operate our business. Our insurance may not cover or be adequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nRisks Related to our Research and Development Activities\nClinical drug development is lengthy, expensive and often unsuccessful. Results of early studies and trials are often not predictive of later trial results. Failure can occur at any stage of drug development. Our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize our product candidates may not succeed.\nClinical development is expensive, lengthy and often unsuccessful. Data from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The results from early clinical trials are often not predictive of results in later clinical trials. Product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having produced positive results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unanticipated or unexpectedly severe adverse events.\nOur current clinical trials may prove inadequate to support marketing approvals. Even trials that generate positive results may have to be confirmed in much larger, more expensive and lengthier trials before we could realistically seek regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nClinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays obtaining regulatory permission to start a trial, changes to the size or design of a trial or changes in regulatory requirements for a trial already underway;\n\u2022\ninability to secure acceptable terms with vendors and an appropriate number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or inability to obtain institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval at prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nslow patient enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of patients or investigators to comply with the clinical trial protocol;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues; and\n\u2022\nnegative findings of inspections of clinical sites or manufacturing operations by us, the FDA or other authorities.\nA trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the trial\u2019s data safety monitoring board, the IRBs governing the sites where the trial is being conducted or the FDA for many reasons, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols, negative findings in an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other authorities, unforeseen safety issues, failure to demonstrate a benefit or changes in government regulations.\nDuring the development of a product candidate, we may decide, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us, to conduct more pre-clinical or clinical studies or to change the size or design of a trial already underway, which could delay or prevent the completion of development and increase its cost. Even if we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate and the results are positive, we may not receive regulatory approval.\nVendors manufacture and distribute the drug product we use in our trials, conduct and manage some of our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis. Failure of these vendors to perform their duties or meet expected timelines may prevent or delay approval of our product candidates.\nThird-party clinical investigators and clinical sites enroll patients and CROs manage many of our trials and perform data collection and analysis. Although we control only certain aspects of these third-parties\u2019 activities, we are responsible for ensuring that every study adheres to its protocol and meets regulatory and scientific standards. If any of our vendors does not perform its duties or\nmeet expected deadlines or fails to adhere to applicable GCP, or if the quality or accuracy of the data it produces is compromised, affected clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain approval for our product candidates. Failure of our manufacturing vendors to perform their duties or comply with cGMPs may require us to recall drug product or repeat clinical trials, which would delay regulatory approval. If our agreements with any of these vendors terminate, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements in a timely manner or on reasonable terms.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our product or product candidates.\nWe cannot promote a product candidate unless the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approves it, which may not happen. Obtaining regulatory approval of a drug is difficult, uncertain, lengthy and expensive. Failure can occur at any stage. In order to receive FDA approval, we must demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that the new drug is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes comply with cGMPs. Our inability or the inability of our vendors to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of product sales and criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our business and financial condition.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and oversight, such as continued safety and other reporting requirements and post-marketing restrictions. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to develop our product candidates or market our products and may be subject to product recalls or seizures. Any regulatory approvals for our product candidates may require costly post-marketing studies. Future governmental action or changes in FDA policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an NDA or supplemental NDA.\nObtaining regulatory approval of product candidates in foreign jurisdictions would be costly and difficult. Failure to obtain such approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates outside the United States.\nWe may seek to commercialize our products in international markets, which would require us to receive a marketing authorization and, in many cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. These approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA\u2019s approval process and, in some cases, more. Approval procedures vary between countries and can require additional pre-clinical or clinical studies. Obtaining approval may take longer than it does in the United States. Although approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by others, failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or cause us significant liability.\nPatients in clinical trials report changes in their health, including new illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not these conditions were caused by the drug candidate being studied or something else. As we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of them becomes more widespread if receive regulatory approval, patients may report serious adverse events that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials. Many times, serious side effects are only detected in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or following commercial approval.\nAdverse events reported in clinical trials can slow or stop patient recruitment, prevent enrolled patients from completing a trial and could give rise to liability claims. Regulatory authorities could respond to reported adverse events by interrupting or halting our clinical trials or limiting the scope of, delaying or denying marketing approval. If we elect, or are required by authorities, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial or commercialization efforts, the commercial prospects of such product candidates or products may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from them may be delayed or eliminated.\nIf one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or adverse events, potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may suspend, limit or withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, including \u201cboxed\u201d warnings, or issue safety alerts other safety information about the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022\nthe product may become less competitive;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\nAny of these events could seriously harm our business.\nWe may face competition from companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources than our own.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical companies, which have greater resources than our own and may develop and commercialize medications that are superior to and less expensive than ours, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe need to increase the size of our organization and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nOur commercial and research and development efforts are constrained by our limited administrative, operational and management resources. To date, we have relied on a small management team. Growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit and retain additional employees. Our financial performance and ability to compete will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively. To that end, we must:\n\u2022\nmanage our sales and marketing efforts, clinical trials, research and manufacturing activities effectively;\n\u2022\nhire more management, clinical development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop our administrative systems and controls.\nFailure to accomplish any of these tasks could harm our business.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract more skilled personnel, we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization goals.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage growth depends upon hiring and retaining skilled managerial, scientific, sales, marketing, and financial personnel. The job market for qualified personnel is intensely competitive. We depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. Any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for a competitor. We do not have employment insurance covering any of our personnel. The loss of key individuals could delay our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to our Capital Needs and Financial Results\nWe may need additional capital to fund our operations or for strategic reasons. Such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are dependent on revenue from the sale of Korlym and our cash reserves to fund our commercial operations and development programs. If Korlym revenue declines, we may need to raise funds to support our plans. We may also choose to raise funds for strategic reasons. We cannot be certain funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In any event, equity financing would cause dilution and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we obtain funds through collaborations with other companies, we may have to relinquish rights to Korlym or our product candidates. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs or even discontinue operations.\nIf we acquire products or product candidates, we will incur significant costs and may not realize the benefits we anticipate.\nWe may acquire a product or product candidate that complements our strategic plan. Such an acquisition may give rise to unforeseen difficulties and costs and may absorb significant management attention. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, which could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest or cause us to incur significant expenses and debt.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain orphan designation for our product candidates our financial results may be negatively affected.\nIn the United States and the EU, orphan drug designation confers financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and reduction of fees or fee waivers. Although we have received orphan drug designation for relacorilant for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome and patients with pancreatic cancer in both the United States and EU, we may be unable to maintain these designations or to obtain designations for our other product candidates, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nTo succeed, we must secure and maintain adequate patent protection for the composition and methods of use of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators and for the use of Korlym to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome and other disorders.\nPatents are uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and are frequently the subject of litigation. The patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged at any time. Similarly, competitors and others may take actions we believe infringe our intellectual property, causing us to take legal action to defend our rights. Litigating with respect to patents and other forms of intellectual property is lengthy, expensive and requires significant management attention. Outcomes are uncertain. If we do not protect our intellectual property, competitors may erode our competitive advantage. Please see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents. Any patent issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Our patent claims may not prevent third parties from producing competing products. The foreign countries in which we may someday operate may not protect our intellectual property to the extent the laws of the United States do. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection in other countries, others may produce competing products in those countries based on our technology.\nThird parties may allege that our patents infringe their rights. Defending against such allegations may result in costly litigation and may require us to obtain a license or bar us from commercializing our product candidates or Korlym for a new indication.\nOur development and commercialization of Korlym or our selective cortisol modulators may give rise to claims that our patents or the patents we have licensed infringe the rights of others, which may require us to engage in costly, time-consuming and possibly unsuccessful litigation. If it is determined that one of our products or product candidates infringe others\u2019 patent rights, we may have to obtain licenses to those rights or delay or suspend commercial activity while we attempt to design around the infringed patent. If our efforts fail, we may be unable to commercialize the infringing product or product candidate. We do not have liability insurance for patent infringement.\nWe do not believe that we infringe any patents or other proprietary rights. We are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property except to the University of Chicago. To maintain these licenses, we must make milestone and royalty payments. If we do not comply with our payment and other obligations, we may lose the right to commercialize cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, for the treatment of TNBC and CRPC.\nOur ability to compete could be diminished if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures may not be adequate, in which case competitors could exploit our proprietary information to our disadvantage. If employees, consultants or anyone else breaches their agreements with us regarding our proprietary information, we may not have adequate remedies for the breach.\nThe mifepristone patents we own or license cover the use of mifepristone, not its composition, which may make it harder to prevent patent infringement.\nWe own or have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents covering the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, to treat a variety of disorders. A method of use patent covers only a particular use of a compound, not its composition. Because our patents do not cover the composition of mifepristone, we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone to treat disorders not covered by our method of use patents. The availability of mifepristone for these disorders may enable patients to obtain mifepristone from other companies for indications covered by our patents. Although such \u201coff-label\u201d use would violate our patents, effectively monitoring compliance and enforcing our rights may be difficult and costly. Mifepristone is sold in the United States by Danco Laboratories for the termination of pregnancy. We cannot be certain that patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome will not be able to obtain mifepristone from Danco or from another company, should it receive approval to market mifepristone for any indication.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe price of our common stock fluctuates widely and is likely to continue to do so. Opportunities for the sale of shares at any particular time may be limited.\nWe cannot assure investors that a liquid trading market for our common stock will exist at any particular time. As a result, holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the current market price. During the 52-week period ended February 12, 2020, our average daily trading volume was approximately 814,063 shares and the intra-day sales prices per share of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from $9.55 to $17.48. As of February 12, 2020, our officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately 16 percent of our common stock.\nOur stock price can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. Securities class action lawsuits are often instituted against companies following periods of stock market volatility. Such litigation is costly and diverts management\u2019s attention from productive efforts.\nFactors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate rapidly and widely include:\n\u2022\nchanges in the expected or actual timing of our competitors\u2019 potential development programs, including developments in ANDA litigation and proceedings before the PTAB and the announcement of ANDA filings seeking approval for generic versions of Korlym;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results or changes to any public guidance we have provided;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nshort selling of our common stock, the publication of speculative opinions about our business or other market manipulation activities by third parties that are intended to lower our stock price or increase its volatility;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or the failure of our performance to meet the published expectations of those analysts or any public guidance we have provided;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations by us, our collaborators or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nconditions in the pharmaceutical industries, including the market valuations of companies similar to Corcept;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nour cash and short-term investment position; and\n\u2022\nadditional financing activities.\nOur stock price may decline if our financial performance does not meet the guidance that we provided to the public, estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations.\nThe guidance we provide as to our expected 2020 revenue is only an estimate of what we believe is realizable at the time we give such guidance. Our actual results may vary materially. It is difficult to predict our revenue. For example, the rate of physician adoption of Korlym and the actions of government and private payers is uncertain. We may experience competition from generic versions of Korlym, which our public revenue guidance does not anticipate. We may not meet our financial guidance or other\ninvestor expectations for other reasons, including those arising from the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Research analysts publish estimates of our future revenue and earnings based on their own analysis. The revenue guidance we provide may be one factor they consider when determining their estimates.\nResearch analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports.\nThe market for our common stock may be affected by the reports financial analysts publish about us. If any of the analysts covering us downgrades or discontinues coverage of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline rapidly and significantly. Paucity of research coverage may also adversely affect our stock price.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause its price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our stock in the public market could reduce its price. As additional shares of our stock become available for public resale, whether by the exercise of stock options by employees or directors or because of an equity financing by us, the supply of our stock will increase, which could cause its price to fall. Substantially all of the shares of our stock are eligible for sale, subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions.\nOur officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions.\nAs of February 12, 2020, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 16 percent of our common stock. Acting together, these stockholders could significantly influence any matter requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. The interests of this group may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because many investors perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.\nChanges in laws and regulations may significantly increase our costs, which could harm our financial results.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, including statutes and regulations concerning the development, approval, and marketing of medications, the provisions of the PPACA requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The Nasdaq Stock Market have and will likely continue to increase our cost of doing business and divert management\u2019s attention from revenue-generating activities.\nWe may fail to comply with our public company obligations, including securities laws and regulations. Such compliance is costly and requires significant management attention.\nThe federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. These developing requirements will continue to increase our compliance costs. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate the effectiveness of, and provide a management report with respect to, our internal controls over financial reporting. It also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our consolidated financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to complete the required assessment and report or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to issue an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price would likely decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. Some of these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders, require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent. In addition, a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or the Board of Directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. These provisions may prevent or delay a change in our Board of Directors or our management, which our Board of Directors appoints. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law could reduce the price that investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90125, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CORT"}
