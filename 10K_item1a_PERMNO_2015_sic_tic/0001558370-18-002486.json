RISK FACTORS\nWe take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision or activity. The challenge of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to identify and measure our risks and then to effectively manage those risks in order to optimize stockholder value. As a banking institution, our risks fall into five broad categories of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and reputational risk. The following discussion highlights the most significant risk factors of which we are aware that could affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we either are not aware of or do not believe to be material could also adversely affect us. If any of the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the potential risks described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PENDING MERGER WITH OLD LINE BANCSHARES\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nAlthough the Company and Old Line Bancshares have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger, the Merger is subject to various closing conditions that might not be satisfied. The Merger will not be consummated unless and until all of those closing conditions are either satisfied or waived by the parties. In addition, satisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, we expect. Any delay in completing the Merger may adversely affect the benefits that the Company and Old Line Bancshares expect to achieve from the Merger and the integration of our businesses. In addition, failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect Old Line Bancshares.\nFailure to complete the Merger could materially and adversely impact our stock price and future businesses and financial results. If the Merger is not completed, then our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nWe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Old Line Bancshares a termination fee of $5,076,000 under the Merger Agreement;\n\u00b7\nWe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u00b7\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u00b7\nMatters relating to the Merger have required and may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial the Company as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the\nMerger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Merger and requires us to pay a termination fee if we do.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits the Company and our directors, officers, representatives and agents, subject to narrow exceptions, from initiating, encouraging, soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding alternative acquisition proposals. The prohibition limits our ability to pursue offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending Merger with Old Line Bancshares from a financial point of view. If we receive an unsolicited proposal from a third party that is superior from a financial point of view to that made by Old Line Bancshares and the Merger Agreement is terminated, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $5,076,000. This fee makes it less likely that a third party will make an alternative acquisition proposal.\nIf the Merger is completed, then Old Line Bancshares may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nBecause the consideration to be paid to our stockholders in the Merger in exchange for their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock consists of Old Line Bancshares common stock, realization of the anticipated benefits in the Merger for our stockholders in the Merger will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of the Company and Old Line Bancshares. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices, operations and support functions.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on Old Line Bancshares\u2019 ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Old Line Bancshares and the Company. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, however, Old Line Bancshares must successfully combine the businesses of Old Line Bancshares and the Company. If Old Line Bancshares is unable to achieve these objectives, then the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOld Line Bancshares and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of key depositors or other bank customers, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect Old Line Bancshares\u2019 and the Company\u2019s ability to maintain their relationships with their respective clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may, to some extent, also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Old Line Bancshares and the Company during such transition period.\nIf the Merger is not completed, then we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger. The completion of the Merger depends on the satisfaction of specified conditions, including the approval of the\nMerger by stockholders of Old Line Bancshares and the Company. There is no guarantee that these conditions will be satisfied. If the Merger is not completed, then these expenses could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations because we would not have realized the expected benefits of the Merger.\nBecause the aggregate consideration to be received in the Merger is subject to adjustment, our stockholders will not know the value of the consideration that they will receive in the Merger until its effective time.\nUpon completion of the Merger, our stockholders will receive, for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock they own, between approximately 0.4047 and 0.4600 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, subject to adjustment, provided that cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares. The consideration will be adjusted in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s recent settlement of certain litigation and its resolution of certain loans. The consideration may also be adjusted if at any time during the five trading days before the effective date of the Merger, the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line Bancshares common stock during the 20 prior trading days is less than $24.30 and the decrease in such price from $27.00 is more than 15% lower than the change in the average of NASDAQ Bank Index prices for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the determination date (the \u201cFinal Index Price\u201d) relative to the NASDAQ Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, which allows the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement, and Old Line Bancshares exercises its right to prevent the Company from so terminating by increasing the consideration (by increasing the number of shares, making a cash payment or a combination of both) so that the per share consideration is an amount that equals the lesser of (i) $11.178 or (ii) (a) the Final Index Price divided by the NASDAQ Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, multiplied by (b) 0.3910 and the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price, divided by (c) the quotient of the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price divided by $27.00. Therefore, the value of the per share and aggregate consideration to be received in the Merger will depend on the market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock on the closing date of the Merger and the applicability and extent of any adjustments. The impact of these adjustments on the number of Old Line Bancshares common stock issued for each share of the Company\u2019 common stock will vary based on the recent trading prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock as of the effective date of the Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the businesses, operations and prospects of Old Line Bancshares and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond Old Line Bancshares\u2019 control.\nAs noted above, the Company has the option, but is not required, to terminate the Merger Agreement if the\naverage price of the Old Line Bancshares common stock falls below certain thresholds, although the Company would not have this option if Old Line Bancshares, in its sole discretion, were to exercise its right to prevent the Company from so terminating by increasing the consideration. We cannot predict at this time whether our board of directors would exercise its right to terminate the Merger Agreement if these conditions were met. The Merger Agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of the Company\u2019s stockholders in the event that the conditions are met following the approval of the Merger by the Company\u2019s stockholders and our board nevertheless chooses to complete the transaction. Our board of directors has made no decision as to whether it would exercise its right to terminate the Merger Agreement. In considering whether to exercise its right to terminate the Merger Agreement, our board of directors would take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances that exist at the time and would consult with our financial advisors and legal counsel.\nPending litigation related to the Merger may delay or prevent the Merger and could cause Old Line Bancshares and the Company to incur significant costs and expenses.\nOn December 14, 2017, Adam Franchi, both individually and on behalf of a putative class of the Company\u2019s stockholders, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Bay Bancorp and its directors as well as Old Line Bancshares (the \u201cLitigation\u201d). The complaint alleges that the version of the joint proxy statement/prospectus that was filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017 omitted certain material information in violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and asks the court to, among other things, enjoin the parties from proceeding with the Merger unless and until they revise the joint proxy statement/prospectus so that it includes the information that is alleged to have been omitted therefrom. In the event that the parties fail to do so and nevertheless proceed with the merger, the complaint asks the court to set aside the Merger or award rescissory damages. On February 14, 2018, without admitting any violation of law, Old Line Bancshares filed an amended joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC, and Mr. Franchi thereafter agreed to dismiss with prejudice all of his claims, but only as to himself and without prejudice to any other member of the putative class of stockholders. On March 28, 2018, the parties to the Litigation entered into a Stipulation and Proposed Order of Dismissal (the \u201cStipulation\u201d) that, if approved by the court, will resolve all issues raised in the Litigation except for a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. No assurance can be given that the court will approve the Stipulation. If the court does not approve the Stipulation, then the Litigation could delay or even prevent the merger and would likely cause the Company and Old Line Bancshares to incur significant legal fees and other costs to defend the claims, which could adversely impact the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and Old Line Bancshares, both before and after the Merger. No assurance can be given that Old Line Bancshares, the Company or the Company\u2019s directors would be successful in the defense of these claims if they are not dismissed.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on the successful growth of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the Bank and its other direct and indirect subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company\u2019s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of these subsidiaries. In the future, part of our growth may come from buying other depository institutions and buying or establishing other companies. Such entities may not be profitable after they are purchased or established, and they may lose money, particularly at first. A new bank or company may bring with it unexpected liabilities, bad loans, or bad employee relations, or the new bank or company may lose customers.\nWe could experience significant difficulties and complications in connection with our growth and acquisition strategy.\nWe grew significantly in 2013, 2015 and 2016 through acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow both organically and by acquiring financial institutions and branches. However, the market for acquisitions is highly competitive. We may not be as successful in identifying financial institutions and branch acquisition candidates, integrating acquired institutions or preventing deposit erosion at acquired institutions or branches as we currently anticipate. Even if we are successful with this strategy, we may not be able to manage this growth adequately and profitably due to unforeseen risks including:\n\u00b7\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired banks;\n\u00b7\nPotential exposure to asset quality issues of acquired banks;\n\u00b7\nPotential disruption to our existing business;\n\u00b7\nPotential diversion of the time and attention of our management; and\n\u00b7\nPotential loss of key employees and customers of the banks and other businesses that we acquire.\nWe may also encounter unforeseen expenses, as well as difficulties and complications in integrating expanded operations and new employees without disruption to our overall operations. Following each acquisition, we must expend substantial resources to integrate the entities. To manage future growth effectively, we will have to maintain and enhance financial and accounting systems and controls, as well as integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our expanding operations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFinally, we may expend significant cash and other resources in connection with a proposed acquisition that ultimately may not be approved by our regulators or the institution\u2019s stockholders, or may not close due to unforeseen circumstances, such as inaccurate representations and warranties made by a party in the definitive acquisition agreement, a party\u2019s breach of its covenants contained in the definitive acquisition agreement, material changes in conditions, and other situations that may be negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. In addition, we may change our strategies in contemplation of an acquisition and its anticipated effects on our financial condition and/or results of operations. If an acquisition does not close, then these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations and/or could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from our expectations. Moreover, a failed acquisition could significantly harm our reputation and cause our investors and customers to lose confidence in us.\nWe face intense competition in our target markets.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, mortgage banking, consumer lending and home equity lending, is highly competitive, and we will continue to encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our target markets in each of our lines of business. Our principal competitors in our target markets are other FSBs, commercial banks and credit unions. However, additional competition is and will continue to be provided by mutual funds, money market funds, finance companies, trust companies, insurers, leasing companies, credit unions and mortgage companies with respect to some of our products and services. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as us and thus have advantages over us in providing certain services. Many of our bank and credit union competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater access to capital and other resources, higher lending limits and larger branch networks. These competitive factors may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our lending and deposit operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by conditions in the local market where we operate and by the national economy.\nOur business activities are concentrated in the greater Baltimore metropolitan area of Maryland, as well as south along the Baltimore-Washington corridor. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to changes in local economic and business conditions. In addition, a significant decline in general economic conditions nationally caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets, declines in the housing market, a tightening credit environment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough economic conditions have improved since the economic recession ended in June 2009, certain sectors, such as real estate and manufacturing, remain weak. Future declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of an uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on our customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, local governments and many businesses are still experiencing difficulty due to lower consumer spending. Any deterioration in local economic conditions could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u00b7\nEconomic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market have resulted, and could again result, in deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolios, and such deterioration in credit quality has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on our business;\n\u00b7\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities; and/or\n\u00b7\nThe processes we use to estimate the allowance for loan losses and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio is made more complex by deteriorating market and economic conditions. A prolonged national economic recession or deterioration of conditions in our local markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for credit losses and result in the following consequences:\n\u00b7\nIncreases in loan delinquencies;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures;\n\u00b7\nDecreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position; and/or\n\u00b7\nDecreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power.\nThe occurrence of any of the above or similar conditions could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe activities and financial condition of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including counterparties in the financial industry, such as commercial banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions will expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, this credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon liquidation or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nTo absorb probable, incurred loan losses that we may realize, we recognize an allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience, and delinquency trends. However, we cannot estimate loan losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses. If charge offs exceed our allowance, our earnings would be adversely affected. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and the Bank beginning with our first full fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This standard will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our loan portfolio includes a substantial amount of commercial real estate loans, our earnings will be particularly sensitive to the financial and credit risks associated with these types of loans.\nThe financial and credit risk associated with commercial real estate loans is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, which is generally larger than consumer-type loans, and the effects of general economic conditions. Any significant failure of our customers to either pay on time or comply with the conditions of their loans would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio represented approximately 43% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot eliminate all risks related to these loans.\nCommercial real estate loans will typically be larger than consumer loans and may pose higher risks than other types of loans. This portfolio is bifurcated into \u201cinvestor\u201d and \u201cowner-occupied\u201d classes, with investor loans representing approximately 65% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio and 28% of the total loan portfolio. The primary source of repayment for investor commercial real estate loans is through the income stream generated by the property or successful development and sale of their properties. We may incur losses on investor commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates, rental rates and capitalization rates, which may decrease property values and may potentially decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives.\nAt December 31, 2017, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represented approximately 35% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio and 15% of the total loan portfolio. The primary source of repayment for owner-occupied real estate loans is the cash flow produced by the related commercial enterprise, and the value of the real estate is a secondary source of repayment of the loan. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending activities subject the Bank to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Bank may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Bank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Bank has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgage loans.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, it is customary for the seller to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The whole loan sale agreements require the repurchase or substitution of mortgage loans in the event we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, there may be a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We receive a limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers as a result of borrower fraud and early payment default of the borrower on mortgage loans. While we have enhanced our underwriting policies and procedures and maintain adequate reserves, these steps may not be effective or reduce the risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to access funding sufficient to support our asset growth.\nOur business plan and marketing strategy is based on access to funding from local customer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, FDIC insurance costs, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our asset growth, we will look to outside sources such as advances from the FHLB. Since the FHLB provides secured funding, our ability to access advances from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and to the extent we can provide collateral. We may also look to brokered deposits or branch acquisitions as a source of liquidity. An inability to obtain alternative funding to supplement our local core deposits or FHLB advances, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings.\nOur earnings are significantly dependent on net interest income, as we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We will experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, negatively affecting our earnings. We are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, rise in unemployment, tightening money supply, and disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Although our asset-liability management strategy is intended to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, we may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\nThe investment securities portfolio has risk factors beyond our control that may significantly influence its fair value. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades, issuer defaults, lack of market pricing, and instability in the credit markets. Any changes in these risk factors could negatively affect our accumulated other comprehensive income and stockholders\u2019 equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future downgrades, defaults or prepayments, including the liquidation of the underlying collateral in certain securities, could result in future classifications as other-than-temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on our future earnings, although the impact on stockholders\u2019 equity will be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive income for securities that were temporarily impaired.\nImpairment of deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2017, our net deferred tax assets were valued at $1.8 million, which included $0.5 million associated with a federal and state net operating loss carryforward which we expect to be substantially utilized in the current year. A deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the evidence available, both negative and positive, including the recent trend of quarterly earnings, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the total deferred tax asset will not be realized. Moreover, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). If an ownership change were to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Code could result in a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused, thereby impairing their value. Section 382\u2019s provisions are complex, and we cannot predict any circumstances surrounding the future ownership of the common stock. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience an ownership change in the future. The impact of such an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to operational risk.\nLike all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes in our systems, human error, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that any changes in circumstances or capabilities of these outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. Although we seek to mitigate operational risks through a system of internal controls which we regularly review and update, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair our ability to prevent fraud or report accurately and timely financial results, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.\nWe are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. These control systems are intended to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to us is made known to management and reported as required by the Exchange Act, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability and preparation of our financial statements, and to provide reasonable assurance that fraud and other unauthorized uses of our assets are detected and prevented. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business and stock price.\nWe are dependent on key personnel, including our executive officers and directors, and the loss of such persons may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe are dependent on the continued services of our executive officers, whose skills and years of industry experience are critical to the successful implementation of our business strategy. Should the services of these key executives become unavailable, there can be no assurance that a suitable successor could be found who would be willing to be employed upon the terms and conditions that we would offer. A failure to replace any of these individuals promptly could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. Additionally, the community involvement, diverse backgrounds, and extensive local business relationships of our directors is important to our success. If the composition of our board of directors were to change significantly, our banking business could suffer.\nWe are, and will continue to be, subject to extensive regulation in the conduct of our business operations, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds and depositors, not stockholders. These regulations affect lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. For example, federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations will limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit. From time to time, the United States Congress and state legislatures consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to further regulate the financial services industry. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the laws governing bankruptcy generally favor debtors, making it more expensive or more difficult to collect from customers who have declared bankruptcy.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is unknown because some rule making efforts are still required to fully implement all of its requirements and the implementation of some enforcement efforts is just beginning. We anticipate continued increases in regulatory expenses as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and affects the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of all financial institutions.\nBased on the text of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations, it is anticipated that the costs to banks may increase or fee income may decrease significantly, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may continue to reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices. Compliance with any such change may impact our business operations.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to adopt rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is new under the law. The full scope of the impact of this authority has not yet been determined as the CFPB has not yet released significant supervisory guidance.\nAs discussed above, the CFPB issued several rules in 2013 relating to mortgage operations and servicing, including a rule requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing and fees. These new rules have required the Bank to dedicate significant personnel resources and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nBank regulators and other regulations, including the Basel III Capital Rules, may require higher capital levels, impacting our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock.\nThe capital standards to which we are subject, including the standards created by the Basel III Capital Rules, may materially limit our ability to use our capital resources and/or could require us to raise additional capital by issuing common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock could dilute existing stockholders.\nRulemaking efforts by the Federal Reserve may negatively impact our noninterest income.\nOn November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve announced the final rules amending Regulation E that prohibit financial institutions from charging fees to consumers for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts-in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Compliance with this regulation was effective July 1, 2010 for new consumer accounts and August 15, 2010 for existing consumer accounts. These new rules negatively impacted the Banks\u2019 noninterest income in 2015 and 2016 and may do the same in future periods.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has issued rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act governing debit card interchange fees that apply to institutions with greater than $10 billion in assets. Although we are not subject to these rules, market forces may effectively require the Bank to adopt a debit card interchange fee structure that complies with these rules, in which case our noninterest income for future periods could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by other recent legislation and rule-making efforts.\nThe GLB Act repealed restrictions on banks affiliating with securities firms and it also permitted certain bank holding companies to become financial holding companies. Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a host of financial activities, and activities that are incidental to financial activities, that are not permitted for bank holding companies who have not elected to become financial holding companies, including insurance and securities underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking, and insurance company portfolio investment activities. The GLB Act may increase the competition that we face from other financial institutions, which could adversely impact our financial condition and/or results of operations in future periods.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management of every publicly traded company to perform an annual assessment of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and to report on whether the system is effective at the end of the company\u2019s fiscal year. If our management were to discover and report significant deficiencies or material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, then the market value of our securities and shareholder value could decline.\nThe USA Patriot Act requires certain financial institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain and prepare additional records and reports that are designed to assist the government\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism. This law includes sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and required additional regulations, including, among other things, standards for verifying client identification when opening an account and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. If we fail to comply with this law, we could be exposed to adverse publicity as well as fines and penalties assessed by regulatory agencies.\nThe Bank is a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nThe Bank is a community banking institution, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is, and will continue to be, dependent on technology and an inability to invest in technological improvements or obtain reliable technological support may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our ability to grow and compete will depend in part upon the ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy their operational needs, while managing the costs of expanding our technology infrastructure. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and third-party support. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. For the foreseeable future, we expect to rely on third-party service providers and on other third parties for services and technical support. If those products and services become unreliable or fail, the adverse impact on customer relationships and operations could be material.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could lead to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure that we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in operations could have an adverse effect on customers. In addition, we must be able to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against physical damage, security breaches and service disruption caused by the internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential customers.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of records and data, which subjects us to additional operational risks.\nLike most community banks, we outsource substantially all of our data processing to third-party providers. These third-party providers could also expose us to operational and information security risk resulting from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulties in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSafeguarding our business and customer information increases our cost of operations. To the extent that we, or our third-party vendors, are unable to prevent the theft of or unauthorized access to this information, our operations may become disrupted, we may be subject to claims, and our net income may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends heavily on the use of computer systems, the Internet and other means of electronic communication and recordkeeping. Accordingly, we must protect our computer systems and network from break-ins, security breaches, and other risks that could disrupt our operations or jeopardize the security of our business and customer information. Moreover, we use third party vendors to provide products and services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, which exposes us to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the service arrangements, including by failing to protect the confidential information we entrust to them. Any security measures that we or our vendors implement, including encryption and authentication technology that we use to effect secure transmissions of confidential information, may not be effective to prevent the loss or theft of our information or to prevent risks associated with the Internet, such as cyber-fraud. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments could permit unauthorized persons to gain access to our confidential information in spite of the use of security measures that we believe are adequate. Any compromise of our security measures or of the security measures employed by our vendors of our third party could disrupt our business and/or could subject us to claims from our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims and the costs of defensive actions, and such claims and costs could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may sue us for losses due to alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, errors and omissions of employees, officers and agents, incomplete documentation, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or many other reasons. Also, our employees may knowingly or unknowingly violate laws and regulations. Management may not be aware of any violations until after their occurrence. This lack of knowledge may not insulate us from liability. Claims and legal actions will result in legal expenses and could subject us to liabilities that may reduce our profitability and hurt our financial condition.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on business and, in turn, results of operation and financial condition.\nConsumers and businesses may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. The possibility of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of interest and fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those\ndeposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s largest stockholder is deemed to be a bank holding company, which exposes us to special risks.\nThe Company\u2019s largest stockholder, H Bancorp LLC (\u201cH Bancorp\u201d), beneficially owns approximately 26.5% of the Company\u2019s common stock and is deemed to be a bank holding company under the BHC Act with respect to the Bank. Under Federal Reserve guidelines, every bank holding company must serve as a \u201csource of strength\u201d for each of their bank subsidiaries. In addition, the FDI Act requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated by the FDIC arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The position of H Bancorp as a source of strength to other depository institutions may limit its ability to serve as a source of strength for us and could adversely affect our ability to access resources of H Bancorp. Federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution\u2019s financial condition.\nA bank for which H Bancorp is deemed to be a bank holding company may be required to indemnify, or cross-guarantee, the FDIC against losses the FDIC incurs with respect to any other bank controlled by H Bancorp. Accordingly, we may be obligated to provide financial assistance to any other financial institution to which H Bancorp is deemed to be a bank holding company. Any financial assistance that we would have to provide could reduce our capital and result in a reduction in the value of our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and, in such case, it may not be able to obtain such capital on favorable terms or at all. In such case, the Company may not be able to execute on its business plans, and its business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBanking authorities require the Company and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. In addition, the Company may elect to raise additional capital in the future to fund its growth or acquisition activities. Any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside its control. Conditions in the capital markets may be such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to the Company on reasonable terms. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to its existing stockholders. Furthermore, the significant amount of common stock that H Bancorp owns may discourage other potential investors from offering to acquire newly issued shares. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital as and when needed, then it may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate its growth and acquisition activities, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nThe shares of common stock are not insured.\nThe shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are not deposits and are therefore not insured against loss by the FDIC or any other governmental or private agency.\nApplicable banking and Maryland laws impose restrictions on the ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends and make other distributions on their capital securities, and, in any event, the payment of dividends is at the discretion of the boards of directors of the Company and the Bank.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends in the future will be largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank, and the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends will depend primarily on its future earnings and capital needs. Bank regulatory agencies have the ability to prohibit proposed dividends by a financial institution which would otherwise be permitted under applicable regulations if the regulatory body determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or\nunsound practice. Banks that are considered \u201ctroubled institutions\u201d are prohibited by federal law from paying dividends altogether. In addition, FSBs, like the Bank, must either submit an application or prior notice to the OCC before making a distribution to its stockholders, and the OCC has the authority to deny or object to that distribution. In any event, the declaration and payment of dividends and the amounts thereof are at the discretion of the board of directors. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Company or the Bank will declare or pay dividends in any future period.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company is limited by regulatory agreement.\nThe Bank is a party to an Operating Agreement with the OCC (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) that imposes certain minimal capital requirements on the Bank. In the Operating Agreement, the Bank agreed that it would not declare or pay any dividends or otherwise reduce its capital unless it is in compliance with the Operating Agreement, including these capital requirements. Due to the Company\u2019s desire to preserve its and the Bank\u2019s capital to fund growth, the Company currently does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition to these regulatory restrictions, it should be noted that the declaration of dividends by the Company and the Bank is at the discretion of their respective Boards of Directors and will depend, in part, on our earnings and future capital needs.\nThe common stock is not heavily traded.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, but shares of the common stock are not heavily traded. Securities that are not heavily traded can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, and various factors affecting the banking industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares the common stock. Management cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for any of the Corporation\u2019s securities will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock may not be able to sell their shares at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nThe Company\u2019s Charter and Bylaws and Maryland law may discourage a corporate takeover.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), and its Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. First, the Charter gives the Board the authority to classify and reclassify unissued shares of stock of any class or series of stock by setting, fixing, eliminating, or altering in any one or more respects the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications of, dividends on, and redemption, conversion, exchange, and other rights of, such securities. The Board could use this authority, along with its authority to authorize the issuance of securities of any class or series, to issue shares having terms favorable to management to a person or persons affiliated with or otherwise friendly to management. Second, the Bylaws require any stockholder who desires to nominate a director to abide by strict notice requirements.\nMaryland law also contains anti-takeover provisions that apply to the Company. The Maryland Business Combination Act generally prohibits, subject to certain limited exceptions, corporations from being involved in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (defined as a variety of transactions, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is defined generally as a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question and after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock. The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act applies to acquisitions of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d, which, subject to certain exceptions, are shares the acquisition of which entitle the holder, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of the corporation in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more, but less than one-third of all voting power; one-third or more, but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares have limited voting rights.\nAlthough these provisions do not preclude a takeover, they may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or deferring a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common stock. These provisions could potentially adversely affect the market prices of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 80517, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BYBK"}
