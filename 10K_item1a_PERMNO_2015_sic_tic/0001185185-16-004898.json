{"cik": "1177845", "company": "XPLORE TECHNOLOGIES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are many risks that affect our business and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and may never become profitable.\nUntil fairly recently, we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception. As of March 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was approximately $140 million, primarily due to our past losses. Historically, our losses have resulted primarily from expenses incurred in research and development of our technology and products and from selling and marketing our products. We may continue to incur additional operating losses as we continue our research and development efforts, introduce new products and expand our sales and marketing activities.\nPrior to the Motion Acquisition, Motion incurred net losses in each fiscal year since its inception. For its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, Motion had a net loss of approximately $9 million and, as of December 31, 2014, its accumulated deficit was approximately $128 million, primarily due to its past losses. In addition, Motion\u2019s revenues decreased from a high of approximately $110 million in 2012 to approximately $83 million in 2014. Because of the deterioration in the Motion business, Motion\u2019s senior secured lender foreclosed on its security interest in substantially all of the assets of Motion, and sold certain of those assets to us.\nSince the Motion Acquisition, our operating expenses have more than doubled. We also incurred additional expenses in fiscal 2016 related to interest payments on the indebtedness we incurred in connection with the Motion Acquisition, amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition, other related acquisition, integration and financing costs, and related depreciation and other amortization. We cannot assure you that our revenue will be adequate to offset these increased expenses, which may keep us from being profitable in the future. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate net profits from operations in fiscal 2017 or subsequent years. We cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or that we will be profitable in any future period.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we derived more than 10% of our revenue from two different customers. If we are unable to replace revenues generated from one or more of our major resellers or end-user customers with revenues from others in future periods, our revenues may decline and our growth would be limited.\nHistorically, in any given year a single customer, either reseller or end-user customer, could account for more than 10% of our revenue. In fiscal year 2016, two resellers, Synnex Information Technologies and Prosys Information Systems, Inc., accounted for approximately 23% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively. Prosys Information Systems, Inc., VT Miltope and Software House International, accounted for approximately 17%, 15% and 14% of our total revenue, respectively, for fiscal year 2015. If we are unable to replace revenues generated from one or more of our major resellers or end-user customers with revenues from others, our revenues may decline and our growth could be limited.\nWe experience lengthy sales cycles for our products and the delay of an expected large order could result in a significant unexpected revenue shortfall.\nThe purchase of our rugged computer systems is often an enterprise-wide decision for prospective end-user customers, which requires us to engage in sales efforts over an extended period of time and provide a significant level of education to prospective end-user customers regarding the uses and benefits of such systems. As a result, our products generally have a lengthy sales cycle, ranging from several months to several years. Consequently, if forecasted sales from a specific end-user customer are not realized, we may not be able to generate revenue from alternative sources in time to compensate for the shortfall. The loss or delay of an expected large order could result in a significant unexpected revenue shortfall. Moreover, to the extent we enter into and perform significant contracts earlier than expected, operating results for subsequent periods may fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate as a result of many factors and our quarterly operating results may not be indicative of results in any given year or future quarter.\nOur quarterly revenue, expenses, operating results, and gross profit margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such fluctuation may result from our inability to replace revenue generated from large orders from one of our major resellers or end-user customers with revenue from other resellers and end-users, the lengthy sales cycle related to our products and delays in the delivery of products and components. Our quarterly revenue could also be materially affected in any period by a decline in the economic prospects of our customers or the economy in general, which could alter current or prospective customers\u2019 spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle for the period. For example, in fiscal year 2016, one of our largest end user customers was the subject of a labor strike, which was only recently settled. During the duration of that strike, our customer greatly reduced its orders for our products. Due to such factors, our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate and such results may not be indicative of our results in any given year or future quarter. As a result, our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some quarters, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from the Motion Acquisition, including potential cost synergies, due to challenges associated with integrating the two operations or other factors.\nThe success of the Motion Acquisition will depend in part on the success of our management in integrating the operations, technologies and personnel. Our management's inability to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the Motion Acquisition could seriously harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the Motion operations into our company will continue to require substantial attention from our management, which could further harm our results of operations.\nThe challenges involved in this integration include:\n\u00b7\nintegrating the operations, processes, people, technologies, products and services;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating and integrating sales and marketing and research and development functions;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrating to our customers that the Motion Acquisition will not result in adverse changes in business focus, products and service deliverables (including customer satisfaction);\n\u00b7\nassimilating and retaining the personnel of both companies and integrating the business cultures, operations, systems and clients of both companies; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and administrative functions.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate operations in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Motion Acquisition, including potential cost and operating synergies or sales or growth opportunities, to the extent or in the time frame anticipated. The anticipated benefits and synergies of the Motion Acquisition are based on assumptions and current expectations, assume a successful integration and reallocation of resources among our facilities without unanticipated costs, and assume our efforts do not have unforeseen or unintended consequences. In addition, our ability to realize the benefits and synergies of the business combination could be adversely impacted to the extent that relationships with existing or potential customers, suppliers or strategic partners are adversely affected as a consequence of the acquisition or by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations.\nWe are currently dependent on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and products under development and our reliance on contract manufacturers subjects us to significant operational risks, many of which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers should they occur.\nWe currently rely primarily on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products. Our reliance involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nreduced management and control of component purchases;\n\u00b7\nreduced control over delivery schedule and quality assurance;\n\u00b7\nreduced control over manufacturing yields;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand;\n\u00b7\nlimited warranties on products supplied to us;\n\u00b7\npotential increases in prices;\n\u00b7\ninterruption of supplies from assemblers as a result of fire, natural calamity, strike or other significant events; and\n\u00b7\nmis-appropriation of our intellectual property.\nOur business is therefore dependent upon our contract manufacturers for their manufacturing capabilities. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we purchased inventory and engineering services of approximately $48.0 million and $23.3 million, respectively, from our contract manufacturers. Our agreements with the contract manufacturers contain provisions that allows for termination for any reason. We cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will continue to work with us, that they will continue to be able to operate profitably, that they will be able to meet our manufacturing needs in a satisfactory and timely manner or that we can obtain additional or alternative manufacturers when and if needed.\nThe availability of our contract manufacturers and the amount and timing of resources to be devoted by them to our activities is not within our control, and we cannot assure you that we will not encounter manufacturing problems that would materially harm our business. The loss of one of our contract manufacturers, a significant price increase, an interruption of supply or the inability to obtain additional or an alternative manufacturer when and if needed would impair our ability to deliver our products to our customers.\nWe face competition from companies that have greater resources than we do and we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our primary competitors in the mobile rugged computer market include Panasonic, Getac, Inc., DRS Technologies and Mobile Demand in the tablet PC market and Panasonic in the notebook market. We also face competition from manufacturers of nonrugged mobile computers, such as Samsung, Inc., Dell, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Apple, Inc., Sony and Toshiba, to the extent customers decide to purchase less expensive traditional computers for use in environments that we believe are better suited for mobile rugged computers. The principal competitive factors in our industry include:\n\u00b7\nproduct performance, features and reliability;\n\u00b7\nprice;\n\u00b7\nname recognition; and\n\u00b7\nproduct availability and lead times.\nMost of our competitors have a wider variety of products, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, because of the higher volume of components that many of our competitors purchase from their suppliers, they are able to keep their costs of supply relatively low and, as a result, may be able to recognize higher margins on their product sales than we do. Many of our competitors may also have existing relationships with our contract manufacturers, the resellers who we use to sell our products, or with our potential customers. This competition may result in reduced prices, reduced margins and longer sales cycles for our products. The introduction of lower-priced personal computers, combined with the brand strength, more product offerings to address shifting demand for specific rugged product form factors, extensive distribution channels and financial resources of the larger vendors, could cause us to lose market share and could reduce our margins on those personal computers we sell. If any of our larger competitors were to commit greater technical, sales, marketing and other resources to our markets, our ability to compete would be adversely affected. If we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors our sales would suffer and as a result our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to acquire key components or are unable to acquire them on favorable terms, our business will suffer.\nSome key components included in our line of products are currently available only from single or limited sources. In addition, some of the suppliers of these components are also supplying certain of our competitors. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will be able to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost-effective manner. We carry little inventory of our products or our product components and, as a result, rely on our suppliers to deliver our products and necessary components to us or our contract manufacturers in a timely manner based upon forecasts we provide. If any of our suppliers become unreliable in providing components, we may not be able to develop an alternative source of supply in a timely manner, which could hurt our ability to deliver our products to our customers. In addition, if we are unable to buy these components on a timely and a cost-efficient basis, we may not be able to deliver products to our customers, or the margins we receive for our products may suffer, which would negatively impact our future financial performance and, in turn, seriously harm our business.\nAt various times, some of the key components for our products have been in short supply. Delays in receiving components would harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, because we expect to rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our suppliers, we cannot predict with certainty our ability to procure components in the longer term. If we receive a smaller allocation of components than is necessary to manufacture our products in quantities sufficient to meet our customers\u2019 demand, those customers could choose to purchase competing products.\nIn January 2015, the supplier of screens for our iX104C6 product went out of business without giving us any prior notice. In addition, the same supplier supplied screens for approximately 50% of Motion\u2019s products. We identified a replacement supplier for this component to continue producing our iX104C6 product, but we were not be able to finish the transition to the new component in time to avoid delays in shipping our iX104C6 product. We also transitioned to a new supplier of screens for the Motion C5 and products. We suffered delays in shipping some of our iX104C6 product orders as well as some of the Motion C5 and product orders in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, some of which may have caused the loss of sales in the that fiscal year and beyond, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the delays in shipping shifted some of our revenues into later periods, which may make it even more difficult for you to rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results.\nIf we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property, our competitive position will be harmed.\nOur ability to compete is heavily affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright and trademark laws, trade secret, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We also enter, and plan to continue to enter, into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties with whom we contract, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. The steps we take to protect our technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, time consuming and costly, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, the effect of either of which would harm our competitive position in the market.\nOthers could claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, which may result in costly and time consuming litigation and could delay or otherwise impair the development and commercialization of our products.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensees with respect to current or future products. Claims for alleged infringement and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could delay the development and commercialization of our products or reduce our margins. If we are unable to obtain a required license, our ability to sell or use certain products may be impaired. In addition, if we fail to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license are burdensome to us, our operations could be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to risks by doing business outside of the United States that could impair our ability to grow our revenues.\nIn the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, approximately 32% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue was comprised of sales made outside of the United States. In the calendar year 2014, approximately 46% of Motion\u2019s revenue was comprised of sales made outside of the United States, much of which was denominated in as many as six foreign currencies. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\n\u00b7\nongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7\nlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers;\n\u00b7\ntrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors and governmental currency controls or devaluations versus the U.S. dollar, which could make our products more expensive in those markets;\n\u00b7\nlocal labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;\n\u00b7\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u00b7\nimport, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in freight costs and duty costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in Taiwan for the production of our tablet computers.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA. Although we are implementing policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of these policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs we continue expanding our cross-border operations into foreign markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which we may be less well-known. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers, fail to anticipate competitive conditions or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets or across markets. The expansion of our international business will also expose us to risks relating to staffing and managing those operations, increases in duty rates, exchange or price controls, increased costs to protect intellectual property, tariffs and other trade barriers, differing and potentially adverse tax consequences, increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements, political, social and economic changes and disruptions, lack of acceptance of our product offerings, challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences and possible difficulty in enforcing contracts or legal rights under foreign legal systems. Accordingly, any efforts we make to expand our international operations may not be successful, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur operations are dependent on the abilities, experience and efforts of a number of key personnel, including Philip S. Sassower, our chairman and chief executive officer, Mark Holleran, our president and chief operating officer, Tom Wilkinson, our chief financial officer and corporate secretary, and Peter Poulin, our chief marketing officer. Should any of these persons or other key employees be unable or unwilling to continue in our employ, our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected. In addition, our success is highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Because we have experienced operating losses, which resulted in a reduction in our workforce in the past, we may have a more difficult time in attracting and retaining the employees we need. Other than an employment agreement with our president and chief operating officer, our relationships with our key employees are \u201cat will.\u201d Also, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring skilled personnel could harm our relations with our customers and our ability to respond to technological change, which could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nWe will depend on the continued performance of certain members of our senior management team and certain other key employees to assist in executing our strategy after the Motion Acquisition. We also expect that our efforts to integrate the Motion product lines will place a significant strain on our personnel, management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Our ability to manage future growth effectively will also require us to successfully attract, train, motivate, retain and manage new employees and continue to update and improve our operational, financial and management controls and procedures. Our employees, including those recently added from Motion, may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us after the Motion Acquisition. These circumstances may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We also must continue to attract and motivate all of our employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals following the Motion Acquisition.\nIf we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could reduce our gross margins or cause us to lose sales.\nWe provide, and will continue to provide, forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers prior to the scheduled delivery of products to our customers. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have excess component inventory, which could increase our costs. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have an inadequate component inventory, which could interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenue. In addition, lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. We may also experience shortages of components from time to time, which also could delay the manufacturing of our products or increase the costs of our products.\nOur inability to obtain any third-party license required to develop new products and product enhancements could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain any third-party license necessary to develop new products or product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must respond quickly and effectively to new technological developments, and the failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our future success also depends on our ability to enhance existing hardware and systems and to respond to changing technological developments. If we are unable to successfully develop and bring to market new hardware and systems in a timely manner, our competitors\u2019 technologies or services may render our products or services noncompetitive or obsolete.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nOur planned implementation of an ERP software solution and other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nWe plan to implement an enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and other complementary information technology systems over the next several years. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The interdependence of these solutions and systems is a significant risk to the successful completion of the initiatives and the failure of any one system could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our overall information technology infrastructure. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, decreases in productivity as our personnel and third party providers implement and become familiar with new systems, increased costs and lost revenues. In addition, transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Implementation of this new information technology infrastructure has a significant impact on our business processes and information systems across a significant portion of our operations. As a result, we will be undergoing significant changes in our operational processes and internal controls as our implementation progresses, which in turn will require significant change management, including recruiting and training of qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully manage these changes as we implement these systems, including harmonizing our systems, data, processes and reporting analytics, our ability to conduct, manage and control routine business functions could be negatively affected and significant disruptions to our business could occur. In addition, we could incur material unanticipated expenses, including additional costs of implementation or costs of conducting business. These risks could result in significant business disruptions or divert management's attention from key strategic initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe anti-takeover effect of certain of our charter provisions could adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nOur authorized capital consists of preferred stock issuable in one or more series. Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and determine the price, designation, rights, preferences, privileges, restrictions and conditions, including voting and dividend rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of additional preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible financings and acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities, which could deprive holders of our common stock of a premium that they might otherwise realize in connection with the acquisition of us by a third party.\nVolatility in the price for our common stock could adversely affect the long-term price of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially. We believe that a variety of factors have caused and could in the future cause the stock price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u00b7\ndilution from our capital raise in March 2015;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty surrounding the Motion Acquisition;\n\u00b7\nquarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nnew products or product enhancements introduced by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in patents and other intellectual property rights and related litigation;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our relationships with our third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers and/or suppliers; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral conditions in the global economy.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of smaller capitalization technology companies in particular, has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Any fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs of June 10, 2016, Phoenix Venture Fund LLC and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 13.6% of our common stock, and thus have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOne of our stockholders, Phoenix Venture Fund LLC, or Phoenix, which is co-managed by Philip S. Sassower, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Andrea Goren, one of our directors, beneficially owns approximately 10.5% of our common stock. In addition, Mr. Sassower, personally and through other entities controlled by him other than Phoenix, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 3.2% of our common stock, and Mr. Goren, personally and through other entities controlled by him other than Phoenix, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 0.4% of our common stock. Thus, Phoenix, Mr. Sassower and Mr. Goren, together, beneficially own in the aggregate, approximately 13.6% of our common stock. Accordingly, Phoenix, Mr. Sassower and Mr. Goren have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters generally requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. Our current policy is to retain any future earnings to finance the future development and expansion of our business. Any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, operating and financial conditions and on such other factors the board of directors deems relevant. Under the terms of our financing agreement with our senior lender, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13658, "SIC": 3571, "TIC": "XPLR"}
