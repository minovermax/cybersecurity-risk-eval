{"cik": "937098", "company": "TRINET GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous complex laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could negatively affect our business.\nThe products and services we provide to our clients are governed by numerous complex federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those described under the heading \"Legal and Regulatory\" in Item 1 of this Form10-K. Many of these laws (such as ERISA and federal and state employment tax laws, wage and hour laws, anti-discrimination laws, etc.) may not result in a consistent approach at the federal, state and local level, do not specifically address PEOs and co-employment relationships or may allow significant regulatory interpretation and discretion in enforcement. As a result, there is uncertainty in how they might be applied to our operations and those of our clients and WSEs.\nNew laws, changes in existing laws, or adverse application or interpretation (in courts, agencies or otherwise) of new or existing laws regarding our co-employment relationship with our clients and WSEs could reduce or eliminate the need for, or benefit provided by, some or all of the services we provide or require us to make significant changes in our methods of doing business and providing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory changes could affect the extent and type of employee benefits employers can or must provide employees, the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay or the time within which employers must remit taxes to the applicable tax authority. For example, continued uncertainty regarding the implementation and future of health care reform in the U.S. under the ACA, any successor to the ACA, related or similar state laws, and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder, has the potential to substantially change the health insurance market for SMBs and how such employers provide health insurance to their employees, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain our clients. In addition, there could be significant changes to the ACA in 2017 and beyond, including the potential modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. Changes to the ACA could also result in new or amended regulations being introduced at the state or local level. Changes in, or uncertainty regarding, the ACA and other health care reforms could impact our business and we are not able to predict the direction or ultimate impact of health care reform on our business operations.\nSimilarly, state regulatory authorities generally impose licensing requirements on companies acting as insurance agents or third-party administrators, such as those that handle health or retirement plan funding and claim processing. We do not believe that our current activities require such licensing, but if regulatory authorities in any state determine that we are acting as an insurance agent or as a third-party administrator, we may need to hire additional personnel to manage regulatory compliance and become obligated to pay annual regulatory fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur co-employment relationship with our worksite employees exposes us to business risks.\nWe are the co-employer of our WSEs. As the co-employer of our WSEs, we assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer. For instance, we are responsible for providing benefits to our WSEs regardless of whether the cost of providing benefits exceeds the fees received from our clients. Under certain circumstances, it could be argued that we are, or we may be found to be, responsible for paying salaries, wages and related payroll taxes of our WSEs, regardless of whether our client timely remits payments to us.\nWe co-employ people in our clients' workplaces. Our ability to control the workplace environment of our clients is limited. As a co-employer of our WSEs, there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or other laws and other acts and omissions by our clients or WSEs, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations.\nWe seek to mitigate these risks through our client agreements and with employment practices liability insurance coverage. Our agreements with our clients establish the contractual division of responsibilities between us and our clients and that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or our WSEs' conduct, however, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect on these contractual obligations. In addition, we maintain employment practices insurance to limit our and our clients' exposure to various WSE related claims, but we are still responsible for any deductible layer under such insurance and such insurance generally excludes coverage for claims relating to the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, other wage and hour issues, and employment contract disputes, among other things. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us and for which we are unable to obtain indemnification from our clients. Negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our corporate employees, our WSEs, or others associated with any of these parties, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our\nbrand. In addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including creating challenges in retaining clients or attracting new clients and hiring and retaining employees.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.\nIn order to sponsor our employee benefit plan offerings for our WSEs, we must qualify as an employer of our WSEs for certain purposes under the Code and ERISA. In addition, our status as an employer is important for purposes of ERISA\u2019s preemption of certain state laws. The definition of employer under various laws is not uniform, and under both the Code and ERISA, the term is defined in part by complex multi-factor tests.\nGenerally, these tests are designed to evaluate whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee and they provide substantial weight to whether a purported employer has the right to direct and control the details of an individual's work. Some factors that the IRS has considered important in the past have included the employer\u2019s degree of behavioral control (the extent of instructions, training and the nature of the work), the financial control and the economic aspects of the relationship, and the intent of the parties, as evidenced by the specific benefit, contract, termination and other similar arrangements between the parties and the on-going versus project-oriented nature of the work to be performed. However, a definitive judicial interpretation of \u201cemployer\u201d in the context of PEOs has not been established. For ERISA purposes, for example, courts have held that test factors relating to ability to control and supervise an individual are less important, while the U.S. Department of Labor has issued guidance that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry do not qualify as common law employers for ERISA purposes. Although we believe that we qualify as an employer of our WSEs under ERISA and the U.S. Department of Labor has not provided guidance otherwise, we are not able to predict the outcome of any future regulatory challenge.\nIf we were found not to be an employer for ERISA purposes, it could adversely affect the manner in which we are able to provide employee benefits to our WSEs. Similarly, to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code, certain employee benefit plans such as 401(k) retirement plans and cafeteria plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees. All of our 401(k) retirement plans are operated pursuant to guidance provided by the IRS and we have received favorable determination letters from the IRS confirming the qualified status of the plans. However, the IRS uses its own complex, multi-factor test to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer. Although we believe that we qualify as an employer of our WSEs under the Code, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge this position or continue to provide favorable determination letters. Moreover, the IRS' 401(k) guidance and qualification requirements are not applicable to the operation of our cafeteria plans.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer under the Code or ERISA, we may be required to change the method by which we report and remit payroll taxes to the tax authorities and the method by which we provide, or discontinue providing, certain employee benefits to our WSEs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe must also qualify as an employer of our WSEs under state regulations, which govern licensing, certification and registration requirements for PEOs. Forty-two states have passed such laws and other states may implement such requirements in the future. While we believe that we qualify as an employer of our WSEs under these state regulations, these requirements vary from state to state and change frequently and if we are not able to satisfy existing or future licensing requirements or other applicable regulations of any states, we may be prohibited from doing business in that state.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims or damage to our reputation.\nMaintaining the security of our IT infrastructure and the confidentiality of our, our clients' and WSEs' personal data and information is paramount for us and our clients. Clients using our technology platform rely on the security of our IT infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our products and services and the protection of their and their WSEs data. We use and store significant personal data and confidential information about our clients, WSEs and employees, including bank account and social security numbers, tax return data, certain medical information, retirement account information and payroll data. Threats to security can take a variety of forms. Hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our networks and data centers. Sophisticated organizations or individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods to gain access to our networks, applications and confidential data. Although we rely on standard security systems, development practices and third-party assessment service to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data, these threats may result in breaches of ou\nr network or data security, disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or other negative impacts on our business.\nMaintaining the security of our WSEs' information is particularly important to us as a sponsor of employee benefit plans with access to certain personal health information. The manner in which we manage protected health information (PHI) is subject to HIPAA and the HITECH Act. Although we maintain, and actively seek to improve, security measures and infrastructure designed to protect against unauthorized access to this sensitive data, cyber-attacks and security breaches remain a significant threat to our business. Any security breach could result in the access, public disclosure, loss or theft of the confidential and personal data of our clients and WSEs, which could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn providing our services, we also rely on third-party service providers and products, such as insurance carriers, to process sensitive information about our clients, WSEs and employees. Through contractual provisions, we take steps to require that our service providers protect sensitive information. However, we cannot provide assurances as to the security steps taken by such providers. Any security breach or other disruption of our third-party service providers that results in an inadvertent disclosure or loss of confidential information could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nWe devote resources to defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers. We focus our defense efforts on the following cyber-security discipline areas:\n\u2022\nsecurity threat detection and prevention,\n\u2022\ndata loss prevention,\n\u2022\nidentity and access management,\n\u2022\naudit, policies and controls, and\n\u2022\nproduct security.\nThe cost of these precautionary measures could reduce our operating margins.\nAny cyber-attack or security breach that accesses or discloses sensitive data may affect negatively our reputation and our client relationships, and the cost of remediating any attack, breach or disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnexpected changes in workers' compensation and health insurance claims by worksite employees could harm our business.\nOur insurance costs, which make up a significant portion of our overall costs, are impacted significantly by our WSEs\u2019 health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience. We establish reserves to provide for the estimated costs of reimbursing our workers' compensation and health insurance carriers under our insurance policies, but the volume and severity of claims activity is inherently unpredictable. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claim activity, our costs could increase, and it could be more difficult to secure replacement insurance policies on competitive terms once our current policies expire. Estimating these reserves involves our consideration of a number of factors and requires significant judgment. If there is an unexpected increase in the severity or frequency of claims activity of our WSEs (including activity arising from any of a number of factors that affect claim activity levels, such as changes in general economic conditions, claims differing significantly from expectations for new and existing clients, proposed and enacted regulatory changes, and terrorism, disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events ), or if we subsequently receive updated information indicating insurance claims were higher than previously estimated and reported, our insurance costs could be higher in that period or subsequent periods as we adjust our reserves accordingly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have experienced insurance cost variability due to claims activity in the past and could have similar or worse experience in the future.\nOur fully-insured agreements with our health insurance carriers include non-guaranteed cost policies that typically include limits to our exposure for individual claims, which are referred to as pooling limits, and limits to our maximum aggregate exposure for claims in each policy year. Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of these policies. We have experienced variability, and may experience variability in the future, in the amounts that we are required to pay our health insurance carriers for group health insurance expenses incurred by WSEs within our deductible layer under non-guaranteed cost policies, based on continually changing trends in the frequency and severity of claims. These historical trends may change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop, which may make it more difficult for us to manage this aspect of our business and which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClient unemployment tax rates can change based on factors outside of our control, which could adversely affect client retention and growth.\nWe must comply with federal unemployment tax regulations and state unemployment tax regulations where our clients are located. Unemployment taxes are generally based on taxable wages. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years\u2019 compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client\u2019s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, some states can retroactively increase unemployment tax rates to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds, and federal unemployment taxes can be retroactively increased in states that have failed to timely repay federal unemployment loans. It may be difficult for us to recover increased taxes from our clients in the event of such retroactive tax increases.\nIn addition, adverse U.S. economic conditions and associated reductions in employment levels can place strain on unemployment systems, which has resulted in substantial increases in state and federal unemployment tax rates over the past few years and this trend may continue. In some states, our clients may face higher rates as a result of these increases under a co-employment relationship with us than they would alone. While we have taken steps to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in state and federal unemployment tax rates, including reporting and remitting unemployment insurance taxes or contributions at the client level and/or under the client\u2019s own account number in approximately 40 states, unexpected state and federal unemployment tax increases or regulatory changes could adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or attract new clients.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nOur future operating results are subject to quarterly variations based upon a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe volume and severity of health and workers' compensation insurance claims by our WSEs, recorded as part of our insurance costs, and the timing of related claims information provided by our insurance carriers,\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our other insurance costs, operating expenses and capital expenditures\n\u2022\nthe number of our new clients initiating service and the number of WSEs employed by each new client,\n\u2022\nthe loss or merger of existing clients,\n\u2022\nreduction in the number of WSEs employed by existing clients,\n\u2022\nthe timing of client payments and payment defaults by clients,\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our acquisitions of companies, assets and technologies,\n\u2022\npayments or drawdowns on our credit facility,\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments,\n\u2022\nexpenses we incur for geographic and service expansion,\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or adverse interpretation of laws increasing our regulatory compliance costs,\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate, and\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nMany of the above factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of these factors\nhave in the past and could in the future cause us to fail to meet our expectations and the expectations of investors and any industry analysts who cover our shares for revenues or other results of operations for a given period, which could result in a decline in our share price and reduced liquidity in our shares. In addition, the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our results of operations to vary widely, which could lead to negative impacts on our margins, short-term liquidity or ability to retain or attract key personnel, and could cause other unanticipated issues, including a downgrade of our shares by or change in opinion of industry analysts and a related decline in our share price. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and annual comparisons of our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nAny failure in our business systems could reduce the quality of our business services, which could harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nOur business systems rely on the complex integration of numerous hardware and software subsystems to manage client transactions including the processing of employee, payroll and benefits data. These systems can be disrupted by, among other things, equipment failures, computer server or systems failures, network outages, malicious acts, software errors or defects, vendor performance problems, power failures, natural disasters, terrorist actions or similar events. Any delay or failure in our systems that impairs our ability to communicate electronically with our clients, employees or vendors or our ability to store or process data could harm our reputation and our business. For example, errors in our products and services, such as the erroneous denial of healthcare benefits or delays in making payroll, could expose our clients to liability claims from improperly serviced WSEs, for which we may be contractually obligated to provide indemnification.\nIn addition, the software, hardware and networking technologies we use must be frequently and rapidly upgraded in response to technological advances, competitive pressures and consumer expectations. To succeed, we need to effectively develop, or license from third parties, and integrate these new technologies as they become available to improve our services. We rely on enterprise software applications licensed from third parties that are upgraded from time to time. Any difficulties we encounter in adapting application upgrades to our systems could harm our performance, delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new services.\nNew products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule, or may contain defects when released. Difficulties in integrating new technologies could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our services, or client claims against us, any of which could harm our business. We could also incur substantial costs in modifying our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes. In addition, we could lose market share if our competitors develop technologically superior products and services.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, we have identified and concluded that we continue to have material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Refer to Part II, Item 9A in this Form 10-K for more details. While the material weaknesses described in that section create a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after extensive review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required.\nAs further described in Part II, Item 9A of this form 10-K below, we are taking specific steps to remediate the material weaknesses that we identified by implementing and enhancing our control procedures. These material weaknesses will not be remediated until all necessary internal controls have been implemented, repeatably tested and determined to be operating effectively. In addition, we may need to take additional measures, including system migration and automation, to address the material weaknesses or modify the remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees and require material cost to implement new process or modify our existing processes. Moreover, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls\nin a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, lead to delisting, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other businesses and technologies, which can divert management's attention and create integration risks and other risks for our business.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions of other businesses and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to grow through similar future acquisitions. Such acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying attractive acquisition candidates,\n\u2022\nover-valuing and over-paying for acquisition candidates,\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations, systems, technologies, services and personnel of the acquired companies, including the migration of WSEs from an acquired company\u2019s technology platform to ours,\n\u2022\nestablishing or maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies relating to the acquired systems and processes, including the potential for actual or perceived control weaknesses associated with or arising from the acquisitions and integration of acquired systems,\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns,\n\u2022\nlitigation resulting from activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former stockholders and other third parties,\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions and unanticipated liabilities of the acquired companies,\n\u2022\ninsufficient indemnification or security from the selling parties for legal liabilities that we may assume in connection with our acquisitions,\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no prior experience and may not succeed,\n\u2022\nrisks associated with foreign acquisitions, such as communication and integration problems resulting from geographic dispersion and language and cultural differences, compliance with foreign laws and regulations and general economic or political conditions in other countries or regions,\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies, and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with clients and employees of the acquired companies or our clients and employees as a result of the integration of acquired operations and new management personnel.\nIf we fail to integrate newly acquired businesses effectively, we might not achieve the growth, service enhancement or operational efficiency objectives of the acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may pay for acquisitions by issuing additional shares of our common stock, which would dilute our stockholders, or by issuing debt, which could include terms that restrict our ability to operate our business or pursue other opportunities and subject us to meaningful debt service obligations. We may also use significant amounts of cash to complete acquisitions. To the extent that we complete acquisitions in the future, we likely will incur future depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the acquired assets. We may also record significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, which could become impaired in the future. Any such impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur SMB clients are particularly affected by volatility in the financial and economic environment, which could harm our business.\nOur clients are small and mid-sized businesses that we believe can be particularly susceptible to changes in the level of overall economic activity in the markets in which we operate. During periods of weak economic conditions, small business failures tend to increase and employment levels tend to decrease. Current or potential clients may react to weak or forecasted weak economic conditions by reducing employee headcount or wages, bonuses or benefits levels, any of which would affect our revenues, and may affect our margins, because we may be unable to reduce our operating expenses sufficiently enough or quickly enough to offset the drop in revenues. It is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction, strength and length of economic cycles. These conditions may affect the willingness of our clients and potential clients to pay outside vendors for services like ours, and may impact their ability to pay their obligations to us on time, or at all. In addition, as a result of macroeconomic factors, interest rates may become more volatile. Rising interest rates may negatively affect our net income due to increased interest expense. Increased interest rate volatility could also negatively impact our clients' and prospects' access to credit. If businesses have difficulty obtaining credit, business growth and new business formation may be impaired, which could also harm our business.\nEven modest downturns in economic activity on a regional or national level could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we are unable to effectively manage this growth, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and have significantly expanded our operations in recent periods, which has placed a strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Managing this growth requires us to further refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures.\nOur ability to effectively manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\neffectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate new employees, while retaining our existing employees, maintaining the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively executing our business plan,\n\u2022\nsatisfy our existing clients and identify and acquire new clients,\n\u2022\nenhance the breadth and quality of our services,\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and\n\u2022\nmake sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company.\nThese activities will require significant operating and capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, and we expect that our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial infrastructure.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner, or at all. In particular, any failure to successfully implement systems enhancements and improvements will likely negatively impact our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public companies. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our costs and expenses may increase more than we expect them to, which in turn could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our vertical strategy is unsuccessful, we may not be able to grow our business at historical rates we experienced.\nWe have developed an industry vertical business strategy and we plan to continue to devote significant resources and time in pursuit of this strategy. Under our industry vertical strategy, our sales force, product development, and service teams are increasingly focused on specific business sectors. We cannot assure you that our industry vertical approach will resonate with our existing and prospective clients or that we will target the right industries or implement our strategy in a timely and effective manner. If our vertical strategy is unsuccessful, our business may not grow at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have rapidly grown our direct sales force historically and we currently expect to rely on this sales force to promote our industry vertical strategy and sell our solutions. Competition for skilled sales personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, training and retaining qualified sales personnel, or that our newly hired sales personnel will function effectively, either individually or as a group. In addition, our newly hired sales personnel are typically not productive for some period of time following their hiring. This results in increased near-term costs to us relative to the sales contributions of these newly hired sales personnel. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and benefit from greater productivity of our sales representatives, or if our sales force is otherwise unable to sell our solutions as we anticipate, our revenues likely will not increase at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business. Refer to Note 13 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about the legal proceedings we are currently involved in and future proceedings that we may face. Current and future legal proceedings may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nChanges in our income tax positions or adverse outcomes resulting from on-going or future tax audits, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows may be impacted if any of our tax positions are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities. In determining the adequacy of our tax provision, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the IRS and other tax authorities. The tax authorities in the U.S. regularly examine our income and other tax returns. Refer to Note 12 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our on-going tax examinations and disputes. The ultimate outcome of tax examinations and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of these or other examinations, we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAdverse changes in our relationships with key vendors, particularly our employee benefit and workers' compensation insurance carriers, could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain arrangements and relationships with the key vendors that supply us with essential components of our services, particularly including the insurance carriers that provide health and workers' compensation insurance coverage for our WSEs. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely or cost effective manner could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or other liabilities to us. If any of these vendors decide to terminate their relationship with us, particularly our employee benefit carriers, we may have difficulty obtaining replacement services at reasonable rates or on a timely basis, if at all. The loss of any one or more of our key vendors, or our inability to partner with certain vendors that are better-known or more desirable to our clients or potential clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, if we are unable to maintain and offer competitive health and/or workers' compensation insurance rates to our clients through well-known insurance carriers, it could affect our ability to attract and retain clients, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Where we offer our clients and their WSEs group health insurance policies with respect to which our carriers set the premiums and for which we are not responsible for any deductible, the rates set by our carriers on such policies may not be competitive. Further, for policies with respect to which we agree to reimburse our carriers for any claims that they pay within an agreed-upon deductible layer, we may not be able to control costs through the deductible layer in a way that would make our rates competitive. In addition, broad\nadoption of our services in certain geographies or industries may make it more difficult for us to obtain competitive health and/or workers' compensation insurance rates due to concentration of clients within a particular geography or industry.\nWe are subject to client attrition.\nWe regularly experience client attrition due to a variety of factors, including cost, client merger and acquisition activity, increases in administrative fees and insurance costs, client business failure, effects of competition and clients deciding to bring their HR administration in-house. Our standard client service agreement can be cancelled by us or by the client without penalty with 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. Clients who intend to cease doing business with us often elect to do so effective as of the beginning of a calendar year. As a result, we have historically experienced our largest concentration of client attrition in the first quarter of each year. In addition, we experience higher levels of client attrition in connection with renewals of the health insurance we provide for WSEs in the event that such renewals result in increased premiums that we pass on to our clients. If we were to experience client attrition in excess of our historic annual attrition rate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which would impair our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our business.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us subject to customary exceptions, including restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional debt,\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock,\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens,\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments and acquisitions,\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock,\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions,\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates,\n\u2022\nenter into certain hedging agreements,\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business,\n\u2022\nprepay certain indebtedness,\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions with another person, and\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that prohibit the incurrence of liens or the payment by our subsidiaries of dividends and distributions.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions and the other terms and conditions under our credit facility could result in a default, which in turn could result in the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit to us under our credit facility and acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness then outstanding under our credit facility. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt, which could materially harm our business and force us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nAtairos, our largest stockholder, may have significant influence over our Company, and the existing ownership of capital stock, and thus the voting control, remains concentrated in our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOn February 1, 2017, an entity affiliated with Atairos Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates, \u201cAtairos\u201d) became our largest stockholder when it acquired the shares of TriNet common stock previously held by General Atlantic. In connection with this transaction, we appointed Michael J. Angelakis, the Chairman and CEO of Atairos, to our board\nof directors and agreed to nominate Mr. Angelakis or another designee of Atairos reasonably acceptable to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for election at future annual meetings until Atairos\u2019 beneficial ownership falls below 15% of our common stock. As of February 1, 2017, Atairos beneficially owned approximately 28.5% of our outstanding common stock, and all of our directors, officers and their affiliates, including Atairos, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 41.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, of the foregoing, Atairos, particularly when acting with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates who beneficially owned in the aggregate, approximately 41.1% of our outstanding common stock, will be able to exert substantial influence on all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to establish the number of directors,\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d,\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan,\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders,\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders,\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws, and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographies and a relatively small number of industries, making us vulnerable to downturns in those geographies and industries.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographies and operate in a relatively small number of industries, including the technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, real estate, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality industries. As a result, if any of those geographic regions or specific industries suffers a downturn, the portion of our business attributable to clients in that region or industry could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or improve our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition on a national and regional level from a number of companies purporting to deliver a range of bundled services that are generally similar to the services we provide, including large professional employer organizations such as the TotalSource business unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as specialized and small professional employer organization service providers. If and to the extent that we and other companies providing these services are successful, we anticipate that future competitors will enter this industry. Some of our current, and any future, competitors have or may have greater marketing and financial resources than we have, and may be better positioned than we are in certain markets. Increased competition in our industry could result in price reductions or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. We expect that we will continue to experience competitive pricing pressure. If we cannot compete effectively, our market share, business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nIn addition to competition from other professional employer organizations, we also face significant competition in the form of companies serving their HR needs in both traditional and non-traditional manners. These forms of competition include:\n\u2022\nHR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that perform their own administration of employee benefits, payroll and HR,\n\u2022\nproviders of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits and business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and other third-party administrators,\n\u2022\nemployee benefit exchanges that provide benefits administration services over the Internet to companies that otherwise maintain their own employee benefit plans; and\n\u2022\ninsurance brokers who allow third party HR systems to integrate with their platform.\nWe believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of our ability to provide access to TriNet-sponsored workers' compensation, health care and other benefits programs to them on a cost-effective basis. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of this coverage in this regard, and our offerings must be priced competitively with those provided by these competitors in order for us to attract and retain our clients.\nWe may not be successful in convincing potential clients that the use of our services is a superior, cost-effective means of satisfying their HR obligations relative to the way in which they currently satisfy these obligations.\nIf we cannot compete effectively against other professional employer organizations or against the alternative means by which companies meet their HR obligations, or if we are unable to convince clients or potential clients of the advantages of our offerings, our market share and business may suffer, resulting in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in March 2014 at a price of $16.00 per share, the daily closing price of our common stock in 2016 ranged from $11.10 to $26.64 per share through December 31, 2016. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations,\n\u2022\nany financial projections we provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections,\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors,\n\u2022\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company,\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments,\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other business services companies generally, or those in our industry in particular,\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole,\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management,\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders,\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us,\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock,\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad, and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many business services companies. Stock prices of many business services companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14521, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "TNET"}
