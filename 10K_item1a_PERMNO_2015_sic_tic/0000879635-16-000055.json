RISK FACTORS\nMid Penn is subject to interest rate risk\nMid Penn\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Mid Penn\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Mid Penn receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) Mid Penn\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of Mid Penn\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of Mid Penn\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Mid Penn\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nManagement believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMid Penn is subject to lending risk\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 70.0% of Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s allowance for possible loan and lease losses may be insufficient\nMid Penn maintains an allowance for possible loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through provisions for possible losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires Mid Penn to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem credits and other factors, both within and outside of Mid Penn\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Mid Penn\u2019s allowance for possible loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance, Mid Penn may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses. Any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s profitability\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of its competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce Mid Penn\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition, and more convenient branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than Mid Penn, which could decrease the deposits that Mid Penn attracts or require Mid Penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, Mid Penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary also competes with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of its non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over Mid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit Mid Penn\u2019s margins on banking services, reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nThe Basel III capital requirements will require us to maintain higher levels of capital, which could reduce our profitability\nBasel III targets higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital. Although the new capital requirements are phased in through January 1, 2019, Basel III signals a growing effort by domestic and international bank regulatory agencies to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain higher levels of capital. The direction of the Basel III implementation activities or other regulatory viewpoints could require additional capital to support our business risk profile prior to final implementation of the Basel III standards. Mid Penn may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than historically maintained, thus potentially reducing opportunities to invest capital into interest-earning assets, which could limit the profitable business operations available to Mid Penn and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf Mid Penn\u2019s information systems are interrupted or sustain a breach in security, those events may negatively affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial performance and reputation\nIn conducting its business, Mid Penn relies heavily on its information systems. Maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, whether due to acts or omissions by Mid Penn or by a third party, and whether intentional or not. Any such failure, interruption, or breach could result in failures or disruptions in Mid Penn\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. A breach of Mid Penn\u2019s information security may result from fraudulent activity committed against Mid Penn or its clients, resulting in financial loss to Mid Penn or its clients, or privacy breaches against Mid Penn\u2019s clients. Such fraudulent activity may consist of check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, \u201cphishing\u201d, social engineering or other deceptive acts. The policies, procedures, and technical safeguards put in place by Mid Penn to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, or security breach of its information systems may be insufficient to prevent or remedy the effects of any such occurrences. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of Mid Penn\u2019s information systems could damage Mid Penn\u2019s reputation, cause Mid Penn to incur additional expenses, result in online services or other businesses becoming inoperable, subject Mid Penn to regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose Mid Penn to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented\nManagement periodically reviews and updates Mid Penn\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of Mid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and principal and interest on its subordinated notes depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary, which is subject to regulatory limits\nMid Penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and subordinated notes, depends on its receipt of dividends from the Bank. Dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits, and retained earnings, imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that Mid Penn\u2019s subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that Mid Penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. Federal Reserve policy, which applies to Mid Penn as a registered bank holding company, also provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period. Mid Penn\u2019s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock.\nThe 5.15% interest rate on our subordinated notes will remain fixed at this level until December 2020, when it will float to prime plus 0.50%\nThe per annum interest rate our subordinated notes is fixed at 5.15% until December 2020, when it will float at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s prime rate plus 0.50%, provided that the interest rate applicable will at no times be less than 4.0%. Depending on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition at the time, an increase in the interest rate could have a material negative effect on its liquidity and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in Central Pennsylvania\nUnlike larger or regional lenders that are more geographically diversified, Mid Penn\u2019s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in central Pennsylvania, especially in eastern Cumberland, Dauphin, northwestern Lancaster, western Luzerne, southern Northumberland, and Schuylkill Counties, which Mid Penn defines as our primary market. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, trends in the national and global economics, and other factors beyond our control. An economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in Central Pennsylvania area could cause an increase in the level of the Bank\u2019s non-performing assets and loan and lease losses, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity, and eroding capital. Mid Penn cannot assure you that adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMid Penn may not be able to attract and retain skilled people\nMid Penn\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by Mid Penn can be intense and Mid Penn may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of Mid Penn\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of Mid Penn\u2019s market, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMid Penn is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to Mid Penn they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of Mid Penn and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe trading volume in Mid Penn\u2019s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies\nMid Penn\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ; the trading volume in its common stock, however, is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which Mid Penn has no control. Given the lower trading volume of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, significant sales of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause Mid Penn\u2019s stock price to fall.\nMid Penn operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations\nMid Penn is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on Mid Penn and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect Mid Penn\u2019s powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting many aspects of our operations, including capital levels, lending and funding practices, and liquidity standards. New laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations, and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Mid Penn has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Mid Penn to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, Mid Penn\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Mid Penn cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Mid Penn. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior levels of market volatility were unprecedented and future volatility may have materially adverse effects on our liquidity and financial condition\nIn the recent past, the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption for more than two years. In some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on stock prices, security prices, and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength. If such levels of market disruption and volatility return, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects, which may be material, on our liquidity, financial condition, and profitability.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments which may adversely affect its earnings\nPoor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures have increased the costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. Additional bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue special assessments. Mid Penn generally is unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that its subsidiary is required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock at the current rate or at all.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPennsylvania Business Corporation Law and various anti-takeover provisions under our articles and bylaws could impede the takeover of Mid Penn\nVarious Pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire Mid Penn, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders. In addition, we have various anti-takeover measures in place under our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including a supermajority vote requirement for mergers, a staggered board of directors, and the absence of cumulative voting. Any one or more of these measures may impede the takeover of Mid Penn without the approval of our board of directors and may prevent our shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of our common stock.\nMid Penn may need to or be required to raise additional capital in the future, and capital may not be available when needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders\nFederal banking regulators require Mid Penn and its subsidiary bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation, and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by Mid Penn\u2019s management and board of directors, based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support Mid Penn\u2019s business operations.\nIf Mid Penn raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities, it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s stock price. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to Mid Penn\u2019s current shareholders, which may adversely impact its current shareholders.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, Mid Penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms and acceptable time frames or to raise additional capital at all. If Mid Penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we conclude that the decline in the value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings\nWe review our investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. If we conclude that the decline is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines have resulted and may result in our concluding in future periods that there is additional impairment of these securities that is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is impaired, the impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future.\nMid Penn\u2019s operations of its business, including its interaction with customers, are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased its risks related to cyber security\nMid Penn is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Mid Penn has observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. To combat against these attacks, policies and procedures are in place to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of its information systems and it has insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks. While Mid Penn has not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor is it aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, it may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if it falls victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nMid Penn is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities\nA significant portion of Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Mid Penn may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Mid Penn may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require Mid Penn to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit Mid Penn\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwith respect to existing laws, may increase Mid Penn\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although Mid Penn has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s financial performance may suffer if its information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments\nEffective and competitive delivery of Mid Penn\u2019s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables Mid Penn to reduce costs. Mid Penn\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Additionally, as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for Mid Penn. There can be no assurance that Mid Penn will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce its ability to compete effectively.\nFuture credit downgrades of the United States Government due to issues relating to debt and the deficit may adversely affect Mid Penn\nAs a result of failure of the federal government to reach agreement over federal debt and the ongoing issues connected with the debt ceiling, certain rating agencies placed the United States government\u2019s long-term sovereign debt rating on their equivalent of negative watch and announced the possibility of a rating downgrade. The rating agencies, due to constraints related to the rating of the United States, also placed government-sponsored enterprises in which Mid Penn invests and receives lines of credit on negative watch and a downgrade of the United States\u2019 credit rating would trigger a similar downgrade in the credit rating of these government sponsored enterprises. Furthermore, the credit rating of other entities, such as state and local governments, may also be downgraded should the United States credit rating be downgraded. The impact that a credit rating downgrade may have on the national and local economy could have an adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85656, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MPB"}
