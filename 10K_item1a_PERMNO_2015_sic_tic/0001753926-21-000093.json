RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have a history of operating losses and our auditors have indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reported losses from operations of $3.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities from operations of $0.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate accumulated deficit of approximately $64.9 million. Such losses have historically required us to seek additional funding through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nAs a result of these net losses and cash flow deficits and other factors, our independent auditors issued an audit opinion with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the two years ended December 31, 2020 that indicated that without obtaining sufficient additional equity or debt funding, there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments would likely include substantial impairment of the carrying amount of our assets and potential contingent liabilities that may arise if we are unable to fulfill various operational commitments. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations and obtaining additional capital and financing, including any funds to be raised in the future. If our ability to generate cash flow from operations is delayed or reduced and we are unable to raise additional funding from other sources, we may be unable to continue in business even if other fundraising is successful. For further discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plan for future liquidity, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nWe are a trading company and depend upon our business for our operating cash flows.\nAll of our operations are conducted, and almost all of our assets are owned, by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations depend upon the cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities and legal restrictions. Any failure to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future explore potential acquisitions of companies or strategic investments to strengthen our business. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf straining our financial resources to acquire a company;\n\u25cf anticipated benefits may not materialize as rapidly as we expect, or at all;\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to address acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former stockholders or other third parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to such strategic investments and acquisitions could result in reducing or completely eliminating any anticipated benefits of transactions and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment.\nWe have estimated our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans.\nIf the costs of implementing such plans should exceed these estimates significantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans which cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to implement such plans fully if at all. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds by way of a rights offering or through the issuance of new shares, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally.\nMany countries, provincial, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, the Company has seen delays in commencement of operations by licensees of the Touchpoint App and platform which leads to subsequent delays in subscriptions being processed. All of the Company employees and management can operate from home whilst the stay-at-home orders remain in place.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measures taken to date will impact the Company\u2019s business for the fiscal first, second and third quarters and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.\nOur executive officers do not reside in the United States.\nOur U.S. stockholders would face difficulty in:\n\u25cf Effecting service of process within the United States on our executive officers, if considered necessary.\n\u25cf Enforcing judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the executive officers.\n\u25cf Enforcing judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws in foreign courts against the executive officers.\n\u25cf Bringing an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the executive officers.\nAccordingly, persons contemplating an investment in our common stock should seriously consider these factors before making an investment decision.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled and creative employees in the future.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our executive officers, our founders and other key employees, and in particular, Mark White, our Chief Executive Officer, and Martin Ward, our Chief Financial Officer. We rely on the leadership, knowledge and experience that our executive officers, founders and key employees provide. They foster our corporate culture, which we believe has been instrumental to our ability to attract and retain new talent. Any failure to attract new or retain key creative talent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for talent in our key areas of operations, including California and New York, is intensely competitive, which could increase our costs to attract and retain talented employees. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits and compensation expenses related to equity awards, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them.\nEmployee turnover, including changes in our management team, could disrupt our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, founders or other key employees, or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled and creative employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe believe our corporate culture has contributed to our success and, if we are unable to maintain it as we grow, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our corporate culture has been a key element of our success. However, as our organization grows, it may be difficult to maintain our culture, which could reduce our ability to attract and maintain new talent and operate effectively. The failure to maintain the key aspects of our culture as our organization grows could result in decreased employee satisfaction, increased difficulty in attracting top talent and increased turnover and could compromise the quality of our client service, all of which are important to our success and to the effective execution of our business strategy. Accordingly, if we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we grow our business, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage and an interruption of our business or loss of a significant amount of property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe currently do not maintain any insurance policies against loss of key personnel and business interruption as well as product liability claims. If such events were to occur, our business, financial performance and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could become involved in claims or litigations that may result in adverse outcomes.\nFrom time-to-time we may be involved in a variety of claims or litigations. Such proceeding may initially be viewed as immaterial but could prove to be material. Litigations are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. Given the inherent uncertainties in litigation, even when we can reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and reasonably estimable loss contingencies, the actual outcome may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach. In addition, such claims or litigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters.\nWe may be unable to adequately safeguard our intellectual property, or we may face claims that may be costly to resolve or that limit our ability to use such intellectual property in the future.\nOur business is reliant on our intellectual property. Our software is the result of our research and development efforts, which we believe to be proprietary and unique. However, we are unable to assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in respect of our intellectual property or that such claims will not be successful. It may be difficult for us to establish or protect our intellectual property against such third parties and we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending any claims relating to proprietary rights. If any party succeeds in asserting a claim against us relating to the disputed intellectual property, we may need to obtain licenses to continue to use the same. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could cause our business results to suffer.\nWhere litigation is necessary to safeguard our intellectual property, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, this could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or future prospects.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws with respect to our activities outside the United States.\nWe distribute our products to locations within and outside the United States as well as operate our business within and outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our business, and any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties that include, but are not limited to, information technology systems (including hosting our website, mobile application and our point of sale system), software development and support, select marketing services, employee benefits servicing and video production and distribution. Services provided by third-party suppliers could be interrupted as a result of many factors, such as acts of nature or contract disputes. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with the third parties\u2019 abilities to provide these services to meet our needs. Any failure by a third party to provide services for which we have contracted on a timely basis or within expected service level and performance standards could result in a disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR STATUS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are subject to additional reporting and corporate governance requirements that will require additional management time, resources and expense.\nAs a public company we are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the Exchange Act. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, all of which impose significant compliance and reporting obligations upon us and require us to incur additional expense in order to fulfill such obligations.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq Capital Market or a stock exchange like the NYSE American. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;\n\u25cf we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n\u25cf overall stock market fluctuations;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the industry;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u25cf future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock and/or warrants. In addition, the stock market in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and/or warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe issuance of a large number of shares of our common stock could significantly dilute existing stockholders and negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOn March 16, 2021 entered into a Standby Equity Commitment Agreement (\u201cSECA\u201d), with MacRab, LLC (\u201cMacRab\u201d) providing that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, MacRab is committed to purchase, on an unconditional basis, shares of our common stock (\u201cPut Shares\u201d) at an aggregate price of up to $5,000,000 over the course of its term. Pursuant to the SECA, the purchase price for each of the Put Shares equals 90% of the lesser of the (i) \u201cMarket Price,\u201d which is defined as the average of the two lowest volume weighted average the Valuation Period. The Valuation Period is the 8 trading days immediately following the date MacRab receives the Put Shares in its brokerage account,. As a result, if we sell shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement, we will be issuing common stock at below market prices, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and if such issuances are significant in number, the amount of the decline in our market price could also be significant. In general, we are unlikely to sell shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement at a time when the additional dilution to stockholders would be substantial unless we are unable to obtain capital to meet our financial obligations from other sources on better terms at such time. However, if we do, the dilution that could result from such issuances could have a material adverse impact on existing stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to fall rapidly based on the amount of such dilution. Under the SECA MacRab received 2,272,727 stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $0.044 upon the signing of the agreement. MacRab retains the rights to the warrants if the agreement is ever terminated.\nMacRab may sell a large number of shares, resulting in substantial diminution to the value of shares held by existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the SECA, we are prohibited from delivering a Put Notice to MacRab if the purchase shares would cause MacRab to beneficially own more than 4.99% of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions, however, do not prevent MacRab from selling shares of common stock received in connection with the $5,000,000 MacRab equity line (the \u201cEquity Line\u201d), including shares purchased pursuant to the warrants granted to MacRab, and then receiving additional shares of common stock in connection with a subsequent issuance. In this way, MacRab could sell more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock in a relatively short time frame while never holding more than 4.99% at any one time. As a result, existing stockholders and new investors could experience substantial diminution in the value of their shares of common stock. Additionally, we do not have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales by MacRab of the shares issued under the Equity Line.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules. It may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we successfully list our common stock on a national securities exchange, or attain and maintain a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may include the following:\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nMany brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common stock will no longer be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d in the future.\nAs a result of our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting has weaknesses and conditions that require correction or remediation, which may reduce investors\u2019 confidence in our financial reports. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and if we fail to continue to comply, our business could be harmed, and the price of our securities could decline.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and the market value of our securities may be negatively affected.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months, subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months, subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information, and notice requirements. Of the 129,288,825 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, approximately 51,056,666 shares are tradable without restriction. Given the limited trading of our common stock, resale of even a small number of shares of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may have anti-takeover effects, which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws, as amended, may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. Further, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion. Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 27204, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "TGHI"}
