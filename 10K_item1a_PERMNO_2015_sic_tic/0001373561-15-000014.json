{"cik": "1373561", "company": "NewStar Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following are important risks and uncertainties we have identified that could materially affect our future results. You should consider them carefully when evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these contingencies could cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. If any of those contingencies actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Loan Portfolio and Lending Activities\nWe may not recover all amounts contractually owed to us by our borrowers resulting in charge-offs, impairments and non-accruals, which may exceed our allowance for credit losses and could negatively impact our financial results and our ability to secure additional funding.\nWe charged off $25.4 million of loans during 2014, and expect to have additional credit losses in the future through the normal course of our lending operations. If we were to experience a material increase in credit losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses in the future, our assets, net income and operating results would be adversely impacted, which could also lead to challenges in securing additional financing.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had delinquent loans of $43.6 million and had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $217.2 million classified as impaired. Of these impaired loans, loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $87.8 million at December 31, 2014 were also on non-accrual status.\nLike other commercial lenders, we experience delinquencies, impairments and non-accruals, which may indicate that our risk of credit loss for a particular loan has materially increased. When a loan is over 90 days past due or if management believes it is probable that we will be unable to collect principal and interest contractually owed to us, it is our policy to place the loan on non-accrual status and classify it as impaired. In certain circumstances, a loan can be classified as impaired, but continue to be performing as a result of a troubled debt restructuring.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an allowance for credit losses of $43.7 million, including specific reserves of $20.7 million. Management periodically reviews the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses. However, the relatively limited history of our loans and leases makes it difficult to judge the expected credit performance of our loans and leases, as it may not be predictive of future losses. Our estimates and judgments with respect to the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses may not be accurate, and the assumptions we use to make such estimates and judgments may not be accurate. Moreover, the estimates and judgments we make regarding workout loans are more sensitive to our assumptions regarding the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover credit or other losses related to our loans and leases as a result of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If we were to experience material credit losses related to our loans, such losses could adversely impact our ability to fund future loans and our business and, to the extent losses exceed our allowance for credit losses, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may have hold positions that exceed our targets which may result in more volatility in the performance of our loan portfolio.\nOur loans and other debt products, which may be part of larger credit facilities, typically range in size from $10 million to $50 million, although we generally limit the size of the loans that we retain to $25 million. In certain cases, however, our loans and debt products may exceed $35 million. We also have the capability to arrange significantly larger transactions that we syndicate to other lenders, including funds that we manage. As a result of syndication and asset management activities, our exposure to certain loans and other debt products may exceed $35 million from time to time through \u201cLoans held-for-sale,\u201d which represent amounts in excess of our target hold for investment position. As of December 31, 2014, we had seven loans that had an outstanding balance greater than $25 million. In each of these cases, we either sought to maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal by adding to our position through a workout or our hold size increased as a result of a portfolio purchase, syndication or through asset management activities. As of December 31, 2014, we had two impaired loans that had outstanding balances greater than $30 million. If a borrower in one of these larger hold positions were to experience difficulty in adhering to the repayment terms of its loan with us, the negative impact to our results of operations and financial condition could be greater than a loan within our general size limits.\nDisruptions in global financial markets have and may continue to increase the number of charge-offs, impairments and non-accruals in our loan portfolio, which may exceed our allowance for credit losses and could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate. Delinquencies, non-accruals and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Our Leveraged Finance, Business Credit and Equipment Finance groups primarily consist of loans and leases to small and medium-sized businesses that may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on their borrowings during these periods. In our Real Estate group, the recent economic slowdown and recession has led to increases in payment defaults on the underlying commercial real estate. Therefore, to the extent that economic and business conditions are unfavorable, our non-performing assets are likely to remain elevated and the value of our loan portfolio is likely to decrease. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the estimated value of the collateral, particularly real estate, securing some of our loans or other debt products. As a result, we may have certain commercial real estate loans that we have not classified as impaired with outstanding balances greater than the estimated value of the underlying collateral. Further or prolonged economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our net interest income, net income and book value.\nWe make loans primarily to privately-owned, small and medium-sized companies that may carry more inherent risk and present an increased potential for loss than loans to larger companies.\nOur loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to small and medium-sized, privately-owned companies, most of which do not publicly report their financial condition. Compared to larger, publicly-traded firms, loans to these types of companies may carry more inherent risk. The companies that we lend to generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position, may need more capital to expand or compete, and may be unable to obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional sources, such as commercial banks. Accordingly, loans and leases made to these types of customers involve higher risks than loans and leases made to companies that have larger businesses, greater financial\nresources or are otherwise able to access traditional credit sources. Numerous factors may make these types of companies more vulnerable to variations in results of operations, changes impacting their industry and changes in general market conditions. Companies in this market segment also face intense competition, including from companies with greater financial, technical, managerial and marketing resources. Any of these factors could impair a customer\u2019s cash flow or result in other adverse events, such as bankruptcy, which could limit a customer\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on our loans and leases, and may lead to losses in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our net interest income, net income and book value.\nAdditionally, because most of our customers do not publicly report their financial condition, we are more susceptible to a customer\u2019s fraud, which could cause us to suffer losses on our loan portfolio. The failure of a customer to accurately report its financial position, compliance with loan covenants or eligibility for additional borrowings could result in our providing loans, leases or other debt products that do not meet our underwriting criteria, defaults in loan and lease payments, the loss of some or all of the principal of a particular loan or loans, including, in the case of revolving loans, amounts we may not have advanced had we possessed complete and accurate information.\nOur concentration of loans and other debt products within a particular industry or region could impair our financial condition or results of operations if that industry or region were to experience adverse changes to economic or business conditions.\nWe specialize in certain broad industry segments, such as business services, industrial, manufacturing and healthcare in which our bankers have experience and strong networks of proprietary deal sources and our credit personnel have significant underwriting expertise. As a result, our portfolio currently has and may develop other concentrations of risk exposure related to those industry segments. If industry segments in which we have a concentration of investments experience adverse economic or business conditions, our delinquencies, default rate and loan charge-offs in those segments may increase, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balloon and bullet transactions may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2014, balloon and bullet transactions represented 92% of the outstanding balance of our loan portfolio. Balloon and bullet loans involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet) principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the borrower to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the loan. The ability of our customers to make this final payment upon the maturity of the loan typically depends upon their ability either to refinance the loan prior to maturity or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan at maturity. The ability of a customer to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to the customer, the financial condition of the customer, the marketability of the related collateral, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, the customer may not have the ability to repay the loan at maturity, and we could lose all or most of the principal of our loan. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, our small and mid-sized customers may have difficulty in repaying or financing their balloon and bullet loans on a timely basis or at all.\nOur cash flow transactions are not fully covered by the value of tangible assets or collateral of the customer and, consequently, if any of these transactions become non-performing, we could suffer a loss of some or all of our value in the assets.\nCash flow lending involves lending money to a customer based primarily on the expected cash flow, profitability and enterprise value of a customer, with the value of any tangible assets as secondary protection. In some cases, these loans may have more leverage than traditional bank debt. As of December 31, 2014, cash flow transactions comprised $2.0 billion, or 78%, of the outstanding balance of our loan portfolio. In the case of our senior cash flow loans, we generally take a lien on substantially all of a customer\u2019s assets, but the value of those assets is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to the customer under a cash flow transaction. In addition, some of our cash flow loans may be viewed as stretch loans, meaning they may be at leverage multiples that exceed traditional accepted bank lending standards for senior cash flow loans. Thus, if a cash flow transaction becomes non-performing, our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan or other debt product would be to force the sale of all or part of the company as a going concern. Additionally, we may obtain equity ownership in a borrower as a means to recover some or all of the principal of our loan. The risks inherent in cash flow lending include, among other things:\n\u2022\nreduced use of or demand for the customer\u2019s products or services and, thus, reduced cash flow of the customer to service the loan and other debt product as well as reduced value of the customer as a going concern;\n\u2022\ninability of the customer to manage working capital, which could result in lower cash flow;\n\u2022\ninaccurate or fraudulent reporting of our customer\u2019s positions or financial statements;\n\u2022\neconomic downturns, political events, regulatory changes, litigation or acts of terrorism that affect the customer\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects; and\n\u2022\nour customer\u2019s poor management of their business.\nAdditionally, many of our customers use the proceeds of our cash flow transactions to make acquisitions. Poorly executed or poorly conceived acquisitions can tax management, systems and the operations of the existing business, causing a decline in both the customer\u2019s cash flow and the value of its business as a going concern. In addition, many acquisitions involve new management teams taking over control of a business. These new management teams may fail to execute at the same level as the former management team, which could reduce the cash flow of the customer available to service the loan or other debt product, as well as reduce the value of the customer as a going concern.\nIf interest rates rise, demand for our loans or other debt products may decrease and some of our existing customers may be unable to service interest on their loans or other debt products.\nMost of our loans and other debt products bear interest at floating interest rates subject to floors. To the extent interest rates increase, monthly interest obligations owed by our customers to us will also increase. Demand for our loans or other debt products may decrease as interest rates rise or if interest rates are expected to rise in the future. In addition, if prevailing interest rates increase, some of our customers may not be able to make the increased interest payments or refinance their balloon and bullet transaction, resulting in payment defaults and loan impairments. Conversely if interest rates decline, our customers may refinance the loans they have with us at lower interest rates, or with others, leading to lower revenues.\nErrors by, or dishonesty of, our employees in making credit decisions or in our loan and other debt product servicing activities could result in credit losses and harm our reputation.\nWe rely heavily on the performance and integrity of our employees in making our initial credit decisions with respect to our loans and other debt products and in servicing our loans and other debt products after they have closed. Because there is generally little or no publicly available information about our customers, we cannot independently confirm or verify the information our employees provide us for use in making our credit and funding decisions. Errors by our employees in assembling, analyzing or recording information concerning our customers could cause us to originate loans or fund subsequent advances that we would not otherwise originate or fund, which could result in loan losses. Losses could also arise if any of our employees were dishonest, particularly if they colluded with a customer to misrepresent the creditworthiness of a prospective customer or to provide inaccurate reports regarding the customer\u2019s compliance with the covenants in its loan or other debt products agreement. If, based on an employee\u2019s dishonesty, we made a loan or other debt product to a customer that was not creditworthy or failed to exercise our rights under a loan or other debt product agreement against a customer that was not in compliance with covenants in the agreement, we could lose some or all of the principal of the loan or other debt product. Fraud or dishonesty on the part of our employees could also damage our reputation which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business.\nWe are not the sole lender or agent for most of our leveraged finance loans or other debt products. Consequently, we do not have absolute control over how these loans or other debt products are administered or have control over those loans. When we are not the sole lender or agent, we may be required to seek approvals from other lenders before we take actions to enforce our rights.\nOur recent loan originations are comprised of a larger percentage of broadly syndicated deals. As such, a majority of our leveraged finance loan portfolio consists of loans and other debt products in which we are neither the sole lender, the agent for the lending group that receives payments under the loan or other debt product nor the agent that controls the underlying collateral. These loans may not include the same covenants that we generally require of our borrowers. For these loans and other debt products, we may not have direct access to the customer and, as a result, may not receive the same financial or operational information as we receive for loans or other debt products for which we are the agent. This may make it more difficult for us to track or rate these loans or other debt products. Additionally, we may be prohibited or otherwise restricted from taking actions to enforce the loan or other debt product or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or other debt product without the agreement of other lenders holding a specified minimum aggregate percentage, generally a majority or two-thirds of the outstanding principal balance. It is possible that an agent for one of these loans or other debt products may choose not to take the same actions to enforce the loan or other debt product or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan that we would have taken had we been the agent for the loan or other debt product.\nOur commitments to lend additional sums to customers may exceed our resources available to fund these commitments, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contractual commitments to lend additional sums to our customers may exceed our resources available to fund these commitments. Some of our funding sources are only available to fund a portion of a loan and other funding sources may not be\nimmediately available. Our customers\u2019 ability to borrow these funds may be restricted until they are able to demonstrate, among other things, that they have sufficient collateral to secure the requested additional borrowings or that the borrowing conforms to specific uses or meets certain conditions. We may have miscalculated the likelihood that our customers will request additional borrowings in excess of our readily available funds. If our calculations prove incorrect, we will not have the funds to make these loan advances without obtaining additional financing. Our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our customers could create breach of contract or other liabilities for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace, which could then adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause there is no active trading market for most of the loans and other debt products in our loan portfolio, we might not be able to sell them at a favorable price or at all. The lack of active secondary markets for some of our investments may also create uncertainty as to the value of these investments.\nWe may seek to dispose of one or more of our loans and other debt products to obtain liquidity or to reduce or limit potential losses with respect to non-performing assets. There is no established trading market for most of our loans and other debt products. In addition, the fair value of other debt products that have lower levels of liquidity or are not publicly-traded may not be readily determinable and may fluctuate significantly on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of the fair value of our other debt products may differ materially from the values that we ultimately attain for these debt products or would be able to attain if we have to sell our other debt products. The value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. In addition, given the limited trading market for our loans and other debt products and the uncertainty as to their fair value at any point in time, if we seek to sell a loan or other debt product to obtain liquidity or reduce or limit losses, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price or at all.\nWe selectively underwrite transactions that we may be unable to syndicate or sell to our credit funds.\nOn a selective basis, we commit to underwrite transactions that are significantly larger than our internal hold targets and we then seek to syndicate amounts in excess of our target to other lenders or plan to season the loan on our balance sheet to satisfy tax requirements and then sell the excess amounts to our credit funds. If we are unable to syndicate or sell these commitments, we may have to sell the additional exposure to third parties on unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we must hold a larger portion of a transaction than we would like, we may not be able to complete other transactions and our loan portfolio may become more concentrated, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans, other debt products and equity-linked products that may rank junior to rights of other lenders, representing a higher risk of loss than our other loans and debt products in which we have a first priority position.\nTo a lesser extent, we provide second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans, other debt products and equity-linked products, which are typically junior in right of payment to obligations to customers\u2019 senior secured lenders and contain either junior or no collateral rights. As a result of their junior nature, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights to collect principal and interest on these loans and other debt products or to recover any of their outstanding balance through a foreclosure of collateral. For example, typically we are not contractually entitled to receive payments of principal on a junior loan or other debt product until the senior loan or other debt product is paid in full, and we may only receive interest payments on a second lien or subordinated / mezzanine asset if the customer is not in default under its senior secured loan. In many instances, we are also prohibited from foreclosing on collateral securing a second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loan or other debt product until the senior loan is paid in full. Moreover, any amounts that we might realize as a result of our collection efforts or in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving a customer under a second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loan or other debt product must generally be turned over to the senior secured lender until the senior secured lender has realized the full value of its own claims. These restrictions may materially and adversely affect our ability to recover the principal of any non-performing senior subordinate, second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans and other debt product. In addition, on occasion we provide senior loans or other debt products that are contractually subordinated to one or more senior secured loans for the customer. In those cases we may have a first lien security interest, but one or more creditors have payment priority over us. As of December 31, 2014, our second lien and, subordinated/mezzanine loans totaled $90.3 million.\nRisks Related to Our Funding and Leverage\nOur ability to grow our business depends on our ability to obtain external financing. If our lenders terminate any of our credit facilities or if we default on our credit facilities, we may not be able to continue to fund our business.\nWe require a substantial amount of cash to provide new loans and other debt products and to fund our obligations to existing customers. In the past, we have obtained the cash required for our operations through the issuance of equity interests and by borrowing money through credit facilities, term debt securitizations and repurchase agreements. We may not be able to continue to access these or other sources of funds.\nDuring 2014, we completed a $289.5 million term debt securitization, issued $200 million of subordinated notes with a commitment to issue an additional $100 million, increased the size of asset-based loan credit facility from $75 million to $110 million, and increased the size of the term loan under our corporate credit facility from $200 million to $238.5 million. Additionally, we called a term debt securitization and redeemed the notes at par.\nSubstantially all of our non-securitized loans and other debt products are held in these facilities. Our credit facilities contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, conditions, events of default and termination events that if breached, not satisfied or triggered, could result in termination of the facility. These events of default and termination events include, but are not limited to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants, and failure to remain within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency and charge-off levels. Further, all cash flow generated by our loans and other debt products subject to a particular facility would go to pay down our borrowings thereunder rather than to us if we are in default. Additionally, if the facility were terminated due to our breach, noncompliance or default, our lenders could liquidate or sell all or a portion of our loans and other debt products held in that facility. Also, if we trigger a default or there is a termination event under one facility and that default or termination results in a payment default or in the acceleration of that facility\u2019s debt, it may trigger a default or termination event under our other facilities that have cross-acceleration or payment cross-default provisions. Consequently, if one or more of these facilities were to terminate prior to its expected maturity date, our liquidity position would be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to satisfy our undrawn commitment balances, originate new loans or other debt products or continue to fund our operations. Even if we are able to refinance our debt, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms. If we are not able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nOur deferred financing fees amortize over the contractual life of credit facilities and over the weighted average expected life of our term debt securitizations.\nWe have recorded deferred financing fees associated with most of our financing facilities. These deferred financing fees amortize over the contractual life of our credit facilities and over the weighted average expected life of our term debt securitizations. If a credit facility were to terminate before its contractual maturity date or if a term debt securitization were to terminate before its weighted average expected life, we would be required to accelerate amortization of the remaining balance of the deferred financing fees which could have a negative impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur lenders and noteholders could terminate us as servicer of our loans, which would adversely affect our ability to manage our loan portfolio and reduce our net interest income.\nUpon the occurrence of specified servicer termination events, our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the notes issued in our term debt securitizations may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans and other debt products under the applicable facility and appoint a successor servicer. These servicer termination events include, but are not limited to, maintenance of certain financial covenants and the loss of certain key members of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our senior management nor have we taken any other precautions to offset the financial loss we could incur as a result of any of their departures, however, we do have employment contracts with our senior management. Certain of our credit facilities include cure rights which would enable us to correct the event of default and maintain our status as servicer.\nIf we are terminated as servicer, we will no longer receive our servicing fee, but we will continue to receive the excess interest rate spread as long as the term debt securitization does not need to trap the excess spread as a result of defaulted loan collateral. In addition, because any successor servicer may not be able to service our loan portfolio according to our standards, any transfer of servicing to a successor servicer could result in reduced or delayed collections, delays in processing payments and information regarding the loans and other debt products and a failure to meet all of the servicing procedures required by the applicable servicing agreement. Consequently, the performance of our loans and other debt products could be adversely affected and our income generated from those loans and other debt products significantly reduced.\nOur liquidity position could be adversely affected if we were unable to complete additional term debt securitizations in the future, or if the reinvestment periods in our term debt securitizations terminate early, which could create a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have completed seven term debt securitizations to fund our loans and other debt products, all of which we accounted for on our balance sheet, through which we issued $2.3 billion of rated notes. Four of these balance sheet term debt\nsecuritization were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our term debt securitizations consist of asset securitization transactions in which we transfer loans and other debt products to a trust that aggregates our loans and, in turn, sells notes, collateralized by the trust\u2019s assets, to institutional investors. The notes issued by the trusts have been rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. At December 31, 2014, the ratings range from AAA to CCC+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Aaa to Ba2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., depending on the class of notes.\nWe intend to complete additional term debt securitizations in the future. Several factors will affect demand for, and our ability to complete additional term debt securitizations, including:\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the capital markets generally, and the asset-backed securities market in particular;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the credit quality and performance of our loan portfolio, particularly that portion which has been previously securitized and serves as collateral for existing term debt securitizations;\n\u2022\nregulatory considerations;\n\u2022\nchanges in rating agency methodology;\n\u2022\nour ability to service our loan portfolio and that ability continuing to be perceived as adequate to make the issued securities attractive to investors; and\n\u2022\nany material downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our term debt securitizations.\nIf we are unable to complete additional term debt securitizations, our ability to obtain the capital needed for us to continue to operate and grow our business would be adversely affected. In addition, our credit facilities are only intended to provide short-term financing for our transactions. If we are unable to finance our transactions over the longer term through our term debt securitizations, our credit facilities may not be renewed. Moreover, our credit facilities typically carry a higher interest rate than our term debt securitizations. Accordingly, our inability to complete additional term debt securitizations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and result of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Market Conditions.\u201d\nIf a specified default event occurred in a term debt securitization, the reinvestment period would be terminated. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund new assets.\nThe cash flows we receive from the interests we retain in our term debt securitizations could be delayed or reduced due to the requirements of the term debt securitization.\nWe have retained 100% of the junior-most interests issued in our balance sheet term debt securitizations, totaling $236.9 million in principal amount, issued in each of our four outstanding balance sheet term debt securitizations as of December 31, 2014. Also, as of December 31, 2014, we have repurchased $6.2 million of outstanding notes of our balance sheet term debt securitizations that were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The notes issued in the term debt securitizations that we did not retain are senior to the junior-most interests we did retain. Our receipt of future cash flows on the junior-most interests is governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans and other debt products included in our term debt securitizations. On a quarterly basis, interest cash flows from the loans and other debt products must first be used to pay the interest on the senior notes and expenses of the term debt securitization. Any funds remaining after the payment of these amounts are distributed to us.\nSeveral factors may influence the timing and amount of the cash flows we receive from loans and other debt products included in our term debt securitizations, including:\n\u2022\nif any loan or other debt product included in a term debt securitization becomes (a) delinquent for a specified period of time as outlined in the indenture, (b) is classified as a non-performing asset, or (c) is charged off, all funds, after paying expenses and interest to the senior notes, go to a reserve account which then pays down an amount of senior notes equal to the amount of the delinquent loan or other debt product or if an overcollateralization test is present, is diverted, and used to de-lever the securitization to bring the ratio back into compliance . Except for specified senior management fees, we will not receive any distributions from funds during this period; and\n\u2022\nif other specified events occur to the trusts, for example an event of default, our cash flows would be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the senior notes and would not be available to us until the full principal balance of the senior notes had been repaid.\nWe have obtained a significant portion of our debt financing through a limited number of financial institutions. This concentration of funding sources exposes us to funding risks.\nWe have obtained our credit facility financing from a limited number of financial institutions. Our reliance on the underwriters of our debt financing and their affiliates for a significant amount of our funding exposes us to funding risks. If these participating lenders decided to terminate our credit facilities, we would need to establish new lending relationships to satisfy our funding needs.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Financial Results\nOur quarterly net interest income and results of operations are difficult to forecast and may fluctuate substantially.\nOur quarterly net interest income and results of operations are difficult to forecast. We have and may continue to experience substantial fluctuations in net interest income and results of operations from quarter to quarter. You should not rely on our results of operations in any prior reporting period to be indicative of our performance in future reporting periods. Many different factors could cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter, including:\n\u2022\nthe success of our origination activities;\n\u2022\npre-payments on our loan portfolio;\n\u2022\ncredit losses on recent transaction and legacy workouts\n\u2022\ndefault rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into financing arrangements;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in our business, including the timing of transactions;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nprivate equity activity;\n\u2022\nthe timing and affect of any future acquisitions;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules;\n\u2022\nchanges in allowance for credit losses methodology;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\ngeneral changes to the U.S. and global economies; and\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or events.\nWe base our current and future operating expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net interest income, transaction activity and rate of growth. We expect that our expenses will increase in the future, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net interest income falls short of our expectations. Any shortfalls in our net interest income or in our expected growth rates could result in decreases in our stock price.\nOur business is highly dependent on key personnel.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Investment Officer as well as other key personnel. Our employment agreements with each of these officers will terminate in October 2015. Although we intend to enter into new employment agreements with these officers, if we were to lose the services of any of these executives for any reason, including voluntary resignation or retirement, we may not be able to replace them with someone of equal skill or ability and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, we may not function well without the continued services of these executives.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.\nOur ability to originate and underwrite loans and other debt products is dependent on the experience and expertise of our employees. In order to grow our business, we must attract and retain qualified personnel, especially origination and credit personnel with relationships with referral sources and an understanding of small and middle-market businesses and the industries in which our borrowers operate. Many of the financial institutions with which we compete for experienced personnel may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. If any of our key origination personnel leave, our new loan and other debt product volume from their business contacts may decline or cease, regardless of the terms of our loan and other debt product offerings or our level of service. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases the costs of replacing them. As competition for qualified employees grows, our cost of labor could increase, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nMaintenance of our Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our operations.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines as an investment company any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40.0% of the value of the issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term \u201cinvestment securities\u201d are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.\nWe expect that many of our majority-owned subsidiaries, including those which we have created (or may in the future create) in connection with our term debt securitizations, will rely on exceptions and exemptions from the Investment Company Act available to certain structured finance companies and that our interests in those subsidiaries will not constitute \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Because these exceptions and exemptions may, among other things, limit the types of assets these subsidiaries may purchase or counterparties with which we may deal, we must monitor each subsidiary\u2019s compliance with its applicable exception or exemption.\nWe must also monitor our loan portfolio to ensure that the value of the investment securities we hold does not exceed 40.0% of our total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. If the combined value of the investment securities issued by our subsidiaries that are investment companies or that must rely on the exceptions provided by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act rather than another exception or exemption, together with any other investment securities we may own, exceeds 40.0% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, we may be deemed to be an investment company. Because we believe that the interests we hold in our subsidiaries generally will not be investment securities, we do not expect to own nor do we propose to acquire investment securities in excess of 40.0% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis. However, the SEC is considering proposing amendments to Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act and issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in August 2011 (Release No. IC-29779) to solicit public comment on the treatment of asset-backed issuers under the Investment Company Act. Under consideration are changes that could amend or eliminate the provision upon which we currently rely to ensure that our interests in certain of our subsidiaries do not constitute investment securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act. If adopted, such changes could, among other things, require us to register as an investment company or take other actions to permit us to continue to be excluded from the definition of investment company. These actions could involve substantial changes to our operations and organizational structure.\nWe monitor for compliance with the Investment Company Act on an ongoing basis and may be compelled to take or refrain from taking actions, to acquire additional income or loss generating assets or to forgo opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial or advisable, including, but not limited to selling assets that are considered to be investment securities or foregoing sale of assets which are not investment securities, in order to ensure that we (or a subsidiary) may continue to rely on the applicable exceptions or exemptions. These limitations on our freedom of action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an exemption, exception or other exclusion from registration as an investment company, we could, among other things, be required to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations either to avoid being required to register as an investment company or to register as an investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to, among other things, our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we did not register despite being required to do so, criminal and civil actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court was to require enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.\nRisks Related to Our Operating and Trading History\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may not achieve profitability in future periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded net income of $10.6 million, $24.6 million, and $24.0 million, respectively. We may not be profitable in future periods for a variety of reasons. If we are unable to achieve, maintain and increase our profitability in the future, the market value of our common stock could further decline.\nWe are in a highly competitive business and may not be able to compete effectively, which could impact our profitability.\nThe commercial lending industry is highly competitive and includes a number of competitors who provide similar types of loans to our target customers. Our principal competitors include a variety of:\n\u2022\nspecialty and commercial finance companies, including business development companies and real estate investment trusts;\n\u2022\nprivate investment funds and hedge funds;\n\u2022\nnational and regional banks;\n\u2022\ninvestment banks; and\n\u2022\ninsurance companies.\nSome of our competitors offer a broader range of financial, lending and banking services than we do and can leverage their existing customer relationships to offer and sell services that compete directly with our products and services. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, origination and other resources than we do. They may also have greater access to capital than we do and at a lower cost than is available to us. For example, if national and regional banks or other large competitors seek to expand within or enter our target markets, they may provide loans at lower interest rates to gain market share, which could force us to lower our rates and result in decreased returns. As a result of competition, we may not be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers or sustain the rate of growth that we have experienced to date, and our ability to expand our loan portfolio and grow future revenue may decline. If our existing customers choose to use competing sources of credit to refinance their debt, our loan portfolio could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to regulation, which limits our activities and exposes us to additional fines and penalties, and any changes in such regulations could affect our business and our profitability.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern non-depository commercial lenders and businesses generally. In response to SEC rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act, we have registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and conformed our activities to regulation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and, in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular businesses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of any registration that we may be required to hold. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and impair our ability to retain clients and develop new client relationships, which may reduce our revenues.\nFurthermore, the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to further modifications and regulation. Any changes in such laws or regulations could affect our business and profitability. In addition, if we expand our business into areas or jurisdictions that are subject to, or have adopted, more stringent laws and regulations than those that are currently applicable to us and our business, we may have to incur significant additional expense or restrict our operations in order to comply, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or prospects.\nOur common stock may continue to have a volatile public trading price.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and the market for our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, some of which are unrelated to our company\u2019s operating performance. Since our common stock began trading publicly on December 14, 2006, the trading price of our stock has fluctuated from a high of $20.85 to a low of $0.61. It is likely that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors which may have a significant adverse effect on our common stock\u2019s market price include:\n\u2022\nthe rate of charge-offs, impairments and non-accruals in our loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates and the actual or perceived impact of these rates on our current customers and future prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we can secure such capital;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our revenues and other financial results.\nThe reported average daily trading volume of our common stock for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2014 was approximately 52,849 shares, however our trading volume has exceeded 1,000,000 shares on several occasions since our initial public offering. Such a low average trading volume may impact our shareholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91674, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "NEWS"}
