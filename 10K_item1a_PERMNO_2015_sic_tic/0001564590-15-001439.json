{"cik": "1432732", "company": "TriVascular Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and related notes, before you decide to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our financial condition and stock price could suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net losses, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future while we establish and grow the sales ramp for our products. Our net loss was $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $295.9 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 deficit and working capital. We have never achieved profitability, and do not anticipate being profitable in the near future. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nAll of our revenue is generated from a limited number of products, and any decline in the sales of these products or failure to gain market acceptance of these products will negatively impact our business.\nWe have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of a limited number of products for the treatment of AAA. From inception through December 31, 2014, our total revenue was derived entirely from sales of our Ovation System, and we expect our revenue to be derived entirely from sales of our Ovation System for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve and maintain significantly greater market acceptance of these products and do not achieve sustained positive cash flow, we will be severely constrained in our ability to fund our operations and the development and commercialization of improvements and other product lines. In addition, if we are unable to market our products as a result of a quality problem, failure to maintain or obtain regulatory approvals, unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects related to our products or the other factors discussed in these risk factors, we would lose our only source of revenue, and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe only recently began selling our products commercially and our products may never achieve market acceptance.\nWe received regulatory approval in the United States in October 2012 and at that time began hiring and training our sales force and selling our products commercially. We have limited experience engaging in commercial activities and limited established relationships with physicians and hospitals, and we may be unable to successfully expand the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nestablished competitors\u2019 relationships with customers;\n\u00b7\nlimitations in our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of our products compared to competing products and the relative safety, efficacy and ease of use of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe limited size of our sales force and the learning curve required to gain experience selling our products;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient financial or other resources to support our commercialization efforts necessary to reach profitability; and\n\u00b7\nthe introduction and market acceptance of competing products and technologies.\nMoreover, physicians and hospitals may not perceive the benefits of our products and may be unwilling to change from the devices they are currently using. Educating these physicians and hospitals on the benefits of our products requires a significant commitment by our marketing team and sales organization. Physicians and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of new products. Physicians may not recommend or prescribe our products until there is more long-term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods, or until they receive additional recommendations from prominent physicians that our products are effective. In addition, physicians and hospitals may initially be unwilling to use our products except in the most challenging anatomies untreatable by other devices. If our products are only used in the most challenging AAA cases, this could lead to increased rates of complications and a skewed perception of the effectiveness of our products, even if our products perform better in those challenging cases than any competing products would be able to perform. We cannot predict when, if ever, physicians and hospitals may adopt more widespread use of our products. If we are unable to educate physicians and hospitals about the advantages of our Ovation System, do not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our products, do not gain momentum in our sales activities, or fail to significantly grow our market share, we will not be able to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to educate physicians on the safe and effective use of our products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nAn important part of our sales process includes the education of physicians on the safe and effective use of our products. There is a learning process for physicians to become proficient in the use of our products and it typically takes several procedures for a physician to become comfortable using the Ovation System. If a physician experiences difficulties during an initial procedure or otherwise, that physician may be less likely to continue to use our product, or to recommend it to other physicians. It is critical to the success of our\ncommercialization efforts to educate physicians on the proper use of the Ovation System, and to provide them with adequate product support during clinical procedures. It is important for our growth that these physicians advocate for the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. If physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injuries, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to develop and retain our direct sales force, our business could suffer.\nWe have a direct sales force in the United States, Canada and in certain European countries. We also utilize a network of independent distributors and agents for sales outside of the United States. As we launch new products and increase our current marketing efforts with respect to existing products and expand into new geographies, we will need to retain, grow and develop our direct sales personnel, distributors and agents. We have made, and intend to continue to make, a significant investment in recruiting and training sales representatives. There is significant competition for sales personnel experienced in relevant medical device sales. Once hired, the training process is lengthy because it requires significant education for new sales representatives to achieve the level of clinical competency with our products expected by implanting physicians. Upon completion of the training, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach in any individual territory. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, and if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our financial performance will suffer. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitors, we may have to wait until applicable non-competition provisions have expired before deploying such personnel in restricted territories or incur costs to relocate personnel outside of such territories, and we may be subject to allegations that these new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information of their former employers.\nWe are in a highly competitive market segment, which is subject to technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use or otherwise more attractive than any products that we may develop, our business will be adversely impacted.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to technological change. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products for use in the treatment of AAA. Any product we develop that achieves regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the AAA stent graft market segment are clinical effectiveness, product safety, reliability and durability, scope of IFU and eligible patient populations, physician experience and comfort with use of a particular EVAR device, ease of use, product support and service, sales force experience and relationships and price. We face significant competition in the United States and internationally, and we expect the intensity of competition will increase over time. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Inc., W.L. Gore Inc., Cook Medical Products, Inc. and Endologix, Inc., each have approved EVAR systems in the United States and Europe. In addition to these major competitors, we also have other emerging competitors and smaller companies, such as Lombard Medical, Inc. and Cordis Corporation with recent introductions into the EVAR market in the U.S. and Europe and other competitors may emerge in the future. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products enjoy several advantages to us, including:\n\u00b7\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing;\n\u00b7\ngreater name recognition;\n\u00b7\nlong established relationships with physicians and hospitals;\n\u00b7\nlonger-term clinical trial data due to earlier regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to offer rebates or bundle multiple product offerings to offer greater discounts or incentives;\n\u00b7\nmore established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks; and\n\u00b7\ngreater experience in and resources for conducting research and development, clinical studies, manufacturing, preparing regulatory submissions, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products and marketing approved products.\nOur competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us or develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or less competitive. We also face fierce competition in recruiting and retaining qualified sales, scientific, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients in clinical studies. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends on physicians\u2019 increased use of our products in endovascular AAA procedures.\nOur low profile AAA products utilize a different sealing technology within the patient\u2019s anatomy and have the ability to address a wider range of difficult anatomies than some of our competitors\u2019 products. We face challenges convincing physicians, many of whom have extensive experience with competitors\u2019 products and established relationships with other companies, to appreciate the benefits of the Ovation System and adopt it for treatment of their patients. If our products are unable to gain wider acceptance by physicians or if physicians\u2019 use of our products declines, our revenue will be impacted, and our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on the growth in the number of AAA patients treated with endovascular devices.\nAAA disease is frequently asymptomatic prior to aneurysm rupture, and is often discovered during procedures for unrelated medical conditions, leading to a fairly low diagnosis rate. While there are currently an estimated 1.2 million people in the United States with AAA disease, it is estimated that only 200,000 people are diagnosed annually, and of the diagnosed population, only 70,000 are treated. Our growth will depend in part upon an increasing percentage of patients with AAA being diagnosed, and an increasing percentage of those diagnosed receiving EVAR, as opposed to an open surgical procedure. Studies have shown that AAA screening reduces AAA-related mortality by up to 50%. Initiatives to increase screening for AAA include the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act, or SAAAVE Act, which was signed into law on February 8, 2006 in the U.S. SAAAVE provides one-time AAA screening for Medicare beneficiaries who have a family history of the disease or other risk factors recommended for screening as specified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Screening is provided as part of the \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d physical and such coverage began on January 1, 2007. The failure to diagnose more patients with AAA could negatively impact our revenue growth.\nWe have limited long-term clinical data to support the safety, efficacy and durability of our products, which could be a barrier to further physician adoption of our products, and unforeseen complications could harm our business and reputation.\nOur longest-term available clinical data from our Ovation Pivotal Trial is five years, and we have comprehensive three-year follow-up data for this patient population. Because we currently lack comprehensive clinical data older than three years supporting the safety, efficacy and durability of our products and the benefits they offer, physicians may be slower to adopt or recommend our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have. Further, future studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products is not superior to treatment with competitive products or that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects. Such results could slow the adoption of our products and significantly reduce our sales, which could prevent us from achieving our forecasted sales targets or profitability, and our business and reputation may be harmed.\nIf clinical studies of our current or future products do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize these products.\nWe are currently conducting clinical trials, including our Ovation Post Approval Study, Ovation PMR Study, the LIFE Study and initiating the LUCY Study. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support new product approvals, or for the approval for new indications for the use of our products. Clinical testing takes many years, is expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA, institutional review boards or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol, force us to modify a previously approved protocol, or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u00b7\npatients do not enroll in, or enroll at a lower rate than we expect, or do not complete a clinical study;\n\u00b7\npatients or investigators do not comply with study protocols;\n\u00b7\npatients do not return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate;\n\u00b7\npatients experience serious or unexpected adverse side effects for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our products such as the advanced stage of co-morbidities that may exist at the time of treatment, causing a clinical study to be put on hold;\n\u00b7\nsites participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties or delays associated with establishing additional clinical sites;\n\u00b7\nthird-party clinical investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or are inconsistent with the investigator agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices, and other FDA and institutional review board requirements;\n\u00b7\nthird-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7\nregulatory inspections of our clinical studies or manufacturing facilities require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in federal, state, or foreign governmental statutes, regulations or policies;\n\u00b7\ninterim results are inconclusive or unfavorable as to immediate and long-term safety or efficacy;\n\u00b7\nthe study design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy; or\n\u00b7\nnot meeting the statistical endpoints.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use. Even if our products are approved in the United States and Europe, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of our products in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States or Europe, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nOur international operations subject us to certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSales of our products outside the United States represented approximately 32.3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. In September 2010, we began selling our products in Europe through our own sales force and through distributors. As of December 31, 2014, we sell our products directly in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and through distributors elsewhere. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components from international sources, subjects us to U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and customs regulations and laws.\nCompliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-boycott laws, as well as export controls laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities.\nIn addition, several of the countries in which we sell our products are, to some degree, subject to political, economic or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u00b7\na shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n\u00b7\nthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive disadvantage to competition with established business and customer relationships;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u00b7\neconomic instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u00b7\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u00b7\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in international countries may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.\nWe rely on a small group of third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products outside the United States.\nWe depend, in part, on medical device distributors for the marketing and selling of our products in most geographies outside of the United States. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. These distributors typically sell a variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling our products. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer. Recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offerings require significant time and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors. Further, if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates, we may be unable to replace that distributor without disruption to our business. If we fail to maintain relationships with our distributors, fail to develop new relationships with other distributors, including in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing distributors effectively, or fail to provide distributors with competitive products on attractive terms, or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results, reputation and business may be harmed.\nIf third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products, our revenues will be negatively impacted.\nOur success in marketing our products depends in large part on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of our products. In the United States, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for our products does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be obtained. Further, one third-party payor\u2019s decision to cover our products does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the products or provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm expressed in its report on our 2013 audited financial statements a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe only recently began selling our products commercially and our products may never achieve market acceptance and we have experienced significant losses from operations since our inception. There is a risk that we will be unable to obtain necessary financing to continue our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed in its auditors\u2019 report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. While the auditors\u2019 report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 did not express such a concern, future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may contain statements expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our common stock.\nWe may be required to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we anticipate our expenses will increase as we seek to continue to grow our business and operate as a public company. We may need to seek additional capital in the future. We believe that our growth will depend, in part, on our ability to fund our commercialization efforts and our efforts to develop new technologies for the treatment of AAA and other aortic disorders, and technology complementary to our current products. Our existing resources\nmay not allow us to conduct all of these activities that we believe would be beneficial for our future growth. As a result, we may need to seek funds in the future. If we are unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to support our commercialization efforts or increase our research and development activities and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe results of our commercialization efforts for our existing and future products;\n\u00b7\nthe need for additional capital to fund future development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nthe establishment of high volume manufacturing and increased sales and marketing capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nour success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nTo finance these activities, we may seek funds through borrowings or through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. We may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all.\nDuring the recent economic instability, it has been difficult for many companies to obtain financing in the public markets or to obtain debt financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow additional funds or issue debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock, and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates, or products that we otherwise would not relinquish. If we do not obtain additional resources, our ability to capitalize on business opportunities will be limited, we may be unable to compete effectively and the growth of our business will be harmed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our term loans with Capital Royalty Partners and Century Medical.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we owed an aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of $52.4 million to Capital Royalty Partners, pursuant to a term loan agreement. We also owed $6.0 million of principal to Century Medical, Inc., pursuant to a term loan. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash balances and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash balances or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and even if we are, these actions may be insufficient to permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event of our breach of the term loan agreements with either Capital Royalty Partners or Century Medical, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated.\nOur existing term loan agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur existing term loan agreements with Capital Royalty Partners and Century Medical contain certain restrictive covenants that either limit our ability to, or require a mandatory prepayment in the event we, incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements and enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of our lenders or prepay the outstanding amounts under the term loan agreements, which could require us to pay additional prepayment penalties. The Capital Royalty Partners agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including minimum revenue and cash balance requirements, and our obligations under the term loans are secured by all of our property, with certain exceptions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under the agreements. Furthermore, our future working capital, borrowings or equity financing could be unavailable to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under the agreements. In the event of a liquidation, Capital Royalty Partners and Century Medical would be repaid all outstanding principal and interest prior to distribution of assets to unsecured creditors and the holders of our common stock would receive a portion of any liquidation proceeds only if all of our creditors, including Capital Royalty Partners and Century Medical, were first repaid in full.\nChallenges in the credit environment may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe global financial markets continue to experience unprecedented levels of volatility. Our ability to enter into or maintain existing financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, or our customers become insolvent. Any deterioration in our key financial ratios, or non-compliance with financial covenants in our existing term loan agreement with Capital Royalty Partners could also adversely affect our business and financial condition. While these conditions and the current economic instability have not meaningfully impaired our ability to access credit markets or our operations to date, continuing volatility in the global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. Current or worsening economic conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers, including their ability to pay for our products. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nWe have been growing rapidly in recent periods and have a relatively short history of operating as a commercial company. For example, we recently significantly expanded our U.S. sales force from 16 sales representatives at December 31, 2012 to 60 sales representatives at December 31, 2014, following the receipt of regulatory approval in the United States. We intend to continue to grow and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion, which could place a significant additional strain on our limited personnel, information technology systems and other resources. In particular, the hiring of our direct sales force in the United States requires significant management, financial and other supporting resources. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nTo achieve our revenue goals, we must successfully increase production output to meet expected customer demand. In the future, we may experience difficulties with production yields and quality control, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel, among other problems. These problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses. Any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nFuture growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIn order to manage our operations and growth we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business will be negatively affected.\nThe market for medical devices is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. It is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the United States and internationally. We have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology. However, we face the risks that:\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to secure necessary patents prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances, thereby permitting competitors to market competing products; and\n\u00b7\nour already-granted patents may be re-examined, invalidated or not extended.\nWe also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties. However, the confidentiality agreements may not be honored or, if breached, we may not have sufficient remedies to protect our confidential information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our consultants, key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information, and such disputes may not be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business and commercial prospects will suffer.\nThe medical device industry, including the EVAR space, is characterized by extensive patent litigation, and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention, require us to pay significant damages or royalty payments or prevent us from marketing and selling our existing or future products.\nOur success depends in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in the medical industry, including among companies focused on EVAR. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our Ovation System. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, particularly as a public company, communications from patent holders, including non-practicing entities, alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or misappropriation of trade secrets, or offering licenses to such intellectual property. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. For example, we are currently involved in a patent dispute with an individual alleging that our products infringe a patent he owns. We are defending this case vigorously and believe the allegations to be without merit.\nThe large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nstop selling, making, or using products that use the disputed intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nobtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, licensing, or using products, which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u00b7\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; or\n\u00b7\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the EVAR industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers and international distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nManufacturing and marketing of our commercial products, and clinical testing of our products under development, may expose us to product liability and other tort claims. Although we have, and intend to maintain, liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, product liability claims could negatively affect our reputation, continued product sales, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our key executives. All of our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice.\nThe replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and would harm our business.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain our executive officers and other key employees. Many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of stock or number of stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Further, our employees\u2019 ability to exercise those options and sell their stock in a public market after our IPO may result in a higher than normal turnover rate. We do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies.\nOur manufacturing operations, research and development activities, and corporate headquarters, are currently based at a single location that may subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe currently conduct all of our manufacturing, development and management activities at a single location in Santa Rosa, California, near known earthquake fault zones. Our finished goods inventory is split between our Santa Rosa location and our third-party European distribution center in Belgium. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of computer data. However, vandalism, terrorism or a natural or other disaster such as an earthquake or fire could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory, and cause us to incur additional expenses. An earthquake in particular could seriously harm our business and results of operations. The insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a number of suppliers who manufacture certain components of our products. We do not have long-term supply agreements with most of our suppliers, and, in many cases, we make our purchases on a purchase order basis. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u00b7\nwe are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\nour suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our Ovation System or cause delays in shipment;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers;\n\u00b7\nswitching components or suppliers may require product redesign and possibly submission to FDA;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster or other catastrophe, impacting one or more of our suppliers, may affect their ability to deliver products to us in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nWe may not be able to quickly establish additional or alternative suppliers in part because of the FDA approval process. Any interruption or delay in obtaining products from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain products from qualified alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to switch to competing products.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of the Ovation System.\nCurrently, the gross profit generated from the sale of our Ovation System is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses. To achieve profitability, we need to, among other things, reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our Ovation System. This cannot be achieved without improving manufacturing efficiency and increasing our manufacturing volume to leverage manufacturing overhead costs. If we are unable to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing overhead costs per unit, our ability to achieve profitability will be severely constrained. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of our Ovation System or delay the\nintroduction of our next generation product or reduce our manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our desired decrease in manufacturing costs, which would prevent us from attaining profitability.\nWe are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales, which include sales within European countries that have recently experienced economic turmoil.\nWe have receivable balances from customers in Europe of approximately $1.8 million as of December 31, 2014. Our accounts receivable in the United States are primarily due from for-profit and not-for-profit private hospitals. Our accounts receivable outside of the United States are primarily due from third-party distributors, and to a lesser extent, public government-owned and private hospitals. Our historical write-offs of accounts receivable have not been significant.\nWe monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. Our third-party distributors operate in certain countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey where economic conditions continue to present challenges to their businesses, and thus, could place in risk the amounts due to us from them. These distributors are owed certain amounts from public hospitals that are funded by their governments. Adverse financial conditions in these countries may continue, thus negatively affecting the length of time that it will take us to collect associated accounts receivable, or impact the likelihood of ultimate collection.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively impact our stock price in the future.\nOur quarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate due to, among others, the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nphysician and hospital acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing, expense and results of research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and obtaining future regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations and operating as a public company;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nsales representatives productivity;\n\u00b7\nsupplier, manufacturing or quality problems with our products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of stocking orders from our distributors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies.\nBecause of these and possibly other factors, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet investor expectations or those of public market analysts.\nAny unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts. New information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our business, which could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nThe seasonality of our business creates variance in our quarterly revenue, which makes it difficult to compare or forecast our financial results.\nOur revenue fluctuates on a seasonal basis, which affects the comparability of our results between periods. For example, we have historically experienced lower sales in the summer months and around the holidays, primarily due to the buying patterns and implant volumes of our distributors and hospitals. These seasonal variations are difficult to predict accurately and at times may be entirely unpredictable, which introduce additional risk into our business as we rely upon forecasts of customer demand to build inventory in advance of anticipated sales. In addition, we believe our limited history commercializing our products has, in part, made our seasonal patterns more difficult to discern, making it more difficult to predict future seasonal patterns.\nWe are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business is located outside the United States and, as a result, we generate revenue and incur expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a majority of which is denominated in Euros. For example, in 2014, approximately 21% of our total revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the exchange rates between\nsuch foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the reporting of our receivables and payables in non-U.S. currencies. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. We are not aware of any breaches of our information technology infrastructure. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations; in addition, we may be unable to use a substantial part of our net operating losses if we don\u2019t attain profitability in an amount necessary to offset such losses.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $263.4 million. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after our IPO, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382. Furthermore, we may be unable to use a substantial part of our NOLs if we do not attain profitability in an amount sufficient to offset such losses.\nThe industry- and market-related estimates included in our public filings are based on various assumptions and may prove to be inaccurate.\nIndustry- and market-related estimates included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, estimates related to our market size and industry data, are subject to uncertainty and are based on assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. This may have negative consequences, such as us overestimating our potential market opportunity.\nRisks Related to Regulation of our Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop, receive regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner.\nIt is important to our business that we continue to build a pipeline of product offerings for treatment of AAA in order to remain competitive. As such, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new products. However, we may not be able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory clearance or approval for product enhancements, or new products, or these products may not be accepted by physicians or the payors who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products.\nThe success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify and anticipate physician and patient needs properly;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u00b7\ncomply fully with FDA regulations on marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u00b7\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products; and\n\u00b7\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products.\nIf we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, or if our competitors introduce new products with enhanced functionalities that are superior to ours, our results of operations will suffer.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new or improved products.\nOur products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA in the United States, and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions. These requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities, an extensive agency review process, and other costly and time-consuming procedures. It often takes several years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. We also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. Some of the most important requirements we face include:\n\u00b7\nFDA Regulations (Title 21 CFR);\n\u00b7\nEuropean Union CE mark requirements;\n\u00b7\nMedical Device Quality Management System Requirements (ISO 13485:2003);\n\u00b7\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration requirements; and\n\u00b7\nCalifornia Department of Health Services requirements.\nGovernment regulation may impede our ability to conduct clinical studies and to manufacture our existing and future products. Government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. The FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our future products on a timely basis, if at all. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals could negatively impact our marketing of any future products and reduce our product revenues.\nOur products remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacturing, marketing and use. We may be forced to modify or recall a product after release in response to regulatory action or unanticipated difficulties encountered in general use. Any such action could have a material effect on the reputation of our products and on our business and financial position.\nFurther, regulations may change, and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies, which could harm our business. We could also be subject to new international, federal, state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways. If this happens, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which will harm our results of operations.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace; result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business; or result in costly investigations and FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in such promotion.\nThe products we currently market have been approved by the FDA for specific treatments and anatomies. We train our marketing and sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-approved indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses\u201d. A physician, however, may use our products off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems appropriate. There could be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those approved by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nPhysicians may also misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, if\nthe FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Member States laws implementing Directive 93/42/EEC concerning Medical Devices, or the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product notifications, recalls, or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, conduct a product notification or recall to inform physicians of changes to instructions for use, or IFU, or if a deficiency in a device is found or suspected. For example, in September 2014 we initiated a voluntary field safety corrective action for a small subset of aortic bodies of a specific size, which affected less than 30 devices sold to international distributors, all of which have been returned to us. During the first quarter 2014, pending the European availability of our updated Ovation IFU, we notified European physicians with scheduled cases of an update concerning an optional procedural step. This update was previously approved by FDA and incorporated in the U.S. IFU during the fourth quarter 2013. We informed FDA of the above-described European physician communication, which FDA formally classified as a recall. Further, in 2012, we conducted a voluntary recall relating to certain lots of our non-implantable fill polymer kit. A government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other issues. Recalls, which include certain notifications and corrections as well as removals, of any of our products could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues.\nWe are required to comply with medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements and must report certain malfunctions, deaths, and serious injuries associated with our products, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA MDR regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the FDA when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the regulatory agency, or Competent Authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred.\nMalfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections, or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls, and redesign the products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are, and will continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by various federal, state or foreign healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, those described below. In particular, we are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the referring, ordering, purchasing or leasing of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe are also subject to the federal HIPAA statute, which, among other things, created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements relating to health care matters.\nWe are also subject to the federal \u201csunshine\u201d law, which requires us to track and report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members in our company so long as it is privately held.\nIn addition, we are subject to the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false records or statements to obtain payment from, or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim.\nMany states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with physicians, and require us to report consulting and other payments to physicians. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recent federal legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or PPACA. The PPACA includes, among other things, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. This excise tax will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry, and if any efforts we undertake to offset the excise tax are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flows. Other elements of the PPACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions, may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely, regardless of our operating performance, in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nvariance in our financial performance from the estimates we provide to the public or the expectations of market analysts;\n\u00b7\nconditions and trends in our industry and the markets we serve;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nlegislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions;\n\u00b7\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation;\n\u00b7\nthe sale of our common stock or other securities in the future by us or our stockholders, including upon expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nIn addition, the market prices of the stock of new issuers and of companies with smaller market capitalizations like us have been volatile and from time to time have experienced significant share price and trading volume changes unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nA large number of additional shares may be sold into the public market in the near future, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The holders of approximately 11.9 million shares of common stock and holders of certain of our warrants have the right to require us to register under the Securities Act any shares in our company pursuant to a stockholders agreement between such holders and us. If such holders, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purpose of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired.\nInsiders have substantial control over us and are able to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors and executive officers and stockholders holding more than 5% of our capital stock and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to the IPO, there was no public market for our common stock. Although we completed our IPO in April 2014 and shares of our common stock are listed and trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell their shares at or above the prices at which they acquired their shares or sell their shares at the time they would like to sell. The lack of active trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies, products or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could reduce our stock price and prevent our stockholders from replacing or removing our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to our common stock, which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nprovide for the adoption of a staggered board of directors whereby the board is divided into three classes each of which has a different three-year term;\n\u00b7\nprovide that the number of directors shall be fixed by the board;\n\u00b7\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies;\n\u00b7\nprovide for the removal of a director only for cause and then by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, except as required by law;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders from calling special stockholder meetings, except as required by law;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders from acting by written consent without holding a meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire certain stockholder litigation proceeding to be brought in Delaware;\n\u00b7\nrequire the vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares to approve amendments to the anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting, except as required by law, in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u00b7\nrequire advance written notice and additional disclosure for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nOur board is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, except that shares of preferred stock may not have more than one vote per share, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock that is convertible into our common stock at greater than a one-to-one ratio, the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We cannot assure you that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe had previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud; and in that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; and in that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock. Prior to our IPO, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. During the course of preparing for our IPO, we determined that material adjustments to the earnings per share amounts were necessary, which required us to restate the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012. This led us to conclude that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have remediated this material weakness primarily by implementing additional review procedures within the finance department and, engaging external accounting experts with the appropriate knowledge to supplement our internal resources in our computation and review processes when appropriate. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date will be sufficient to avoid future material weaknesses. Even when we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or help prevent fraud. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic reports on a timely basis which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, compliance with these rules and regulations nonetheless increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we will no longer be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this report and in other filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition are more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business, brand and reputation and results of operations.\nWe also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends and our current term loan agreements with Capital Royalty Partners and Century Medical contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The declaration and payment of all future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion our board of directors, which retains the right to change our dividend policy at any time, and may be limited by our debt arrangements in place from time to time. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.", "PERMNO": 14612, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "TRIV"}
