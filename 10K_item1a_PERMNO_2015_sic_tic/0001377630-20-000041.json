Holders of the Company\u2019s securities and prospective investors should consider carefully the following material risks and other information in this document, including our historical financial statements and related notes included herein. The material risks and uncertainties described in this document are not the only ones facing us. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in this document actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nSignificant declines in theater attendance could reduce the attractiveness of cinema advertising and could reduce our revenue\nOur business is affected by the level of attendance at the founding members\u2019 theaters and to a lesser extent our network affiliates, who operate in a highly competitive industry and whose attendance is reliant on the presence of motion pictures that attract audiences. Over the last 10 years, theater attendance has fluctuated from year to year but on average has remained relatively flat. The value of our advertising business could be adversely affected by a decline in theater attendance or even the perception by media buyers that our network is no longer relevant to their marketing plan due to the decreases in attendance and geographic coverage. Factors that could reduce attendance at our network theaters include the following:\n\u2022\nif NCM LLC\u2019s network theater circuits cannot compete with other out-of-home entertainment due to an increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods (and the shortening of the \u201crelease window\u201d between the release of major motion pictures to the alternative delivery methods), including network, video streaming and downloads via the Internet;\n\u2022\ntheater circuits in NCM LLC\u2019s network continue to renovate auditoriums in certain of their theaters to install new larger, more comfortable seating, which reduces the number of seats in a theater auditorium. This renovation has been viewed favorably by patrons and many theater circuits have noted an intent to continue such renovations;\n\u2022\nchanges in theater operating policies, including the number and length of trailers for upcoming films that are played prior to the start of the feature film, which if the length of trailers increases, may result in most or all of the Noovie pre-show starting further out from the actual start of the feature film;\n\u2022\nany reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general that reduces the demand for motion pictures or adversely affects the motion picture production industry;\n\u2022\nthe success of first-run motion pictures, which depends upon the production and marketing efforts of the major studios and the attractiveness and value proposition of the movies to consumers compared to other forms of entertainment;\n\u2022\nif the theaters in our network fail to maintain their theaters and provide amenities that consumers prefer;\n\u2022\nif studios begin to reduce the number of feature films produced for theater exhibition and their investments in those films or reduce the investments made to market those films;\n\u2022\nif future theater attendance declines significantly over an extended time period, one or more of the founding members or network affiliates may face financial difficulties and could be forced to sell or close theaters or reduce the number of screens it builds or upgrades or increase ticket prices; and\n\u2022\nNCM LLC\u2019s network theater circuits also may not successfully compete for licenses to exhibit quality films and are not assured a consistent supply of motion pictures if they do not have long-term arrangements with major film distributors.\nAny of these circumstances could reduce our revenue because our national and regional advertising revenue, and local advertising to a lesser extent, depends on the number of theater patrons who attend movies. Additionally, if attendance declines significantly, the Company will be required to provide additional advertising time (makegoods) to national advertisers to reach agreed-on audience delivery thresholds. Certain of these circumstances can also lead to volatility within our utilization. We have also experienced volatility in our utilization over the years, with annual national inventory utilization ranging from 113.5% to 128.3% from 2015 through 2019. We experience even more substantial volatility quarter-to-quarter.\nChanges in theater patron behavior could result in declines in the viewership of our Noovie pre-show which could reduce the attractiveness of cinema advertising and our revenues.\nThe value of our national and regional on-screen advertising and to a lesser extent our local advertising is based on the number of theater patrons that are in their seats and thus have the opportunity to view the Noovie pre-show. Trends in patron behavior that could reduce viewership of our Noovie pre-show include the following:\n\u2022\ntheater patrons are increasingly purchasing tickets ahead of time via on-line ticketing mediums and when available reserving a seat in the theater (offered in approximately 84.9% of our network as of December 26, 2019), which could affect how early patrons arrive to the theater and reduce the number of patrons that are in a theater seat to view most or all of the Noovie pre-show; and\n\u2022\nchanges in theater patron amenities, including, online ticketing, bars and entertainment within exhibitor lobbies causing increased dwell time of patrons.\nNational advertising sales and rates are dependent on the methodology used to measure audience impressions. If a change is made to this methodology that reflects fewer audience impressions available during the pre-show, this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the 2019 ESA Amendments.\nOn September 17, 2019, NCM LLC entered into the 2019 ESA Amendments with affiliates of each of Cinemark and Regal. Among other things, the 2019 ESA Amendments provide that, beginning November 1, 2019, NCM LLC is entitled to display up to five minutes of the Noovie pre-show after the scheduled showtime of a feature film and a Platinum Spot that is either 30 or 60 seconds of the Noovie pre-show in the trailer position directly prior to the \u201cattached\u201d trailers preceding the feature film.\nWe expect the 2019 ESA Amendments to result in an increase in average CPM, revenues and Adjusted OIBDA, however we may not realize any or all such benefits. Potential difficulties and uncertainties that may impair the full realization of the anticipated benefits include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe behavior of theater patrons may change in response to the display of a portion of the Noovie pre-show after the advertised showtime, or in response to the combination of advertising and trailers before the start of the feature film, resulting in a reduction to the number of patrons that are in a theater seat to view most or all of the Noovie pre-show;\n\u2022\nexhibitors may encounter issues in displaying a portion of the Noovie pre-show after the advertised showtime because of technical issues, access issues with their content providers, or other issues that may arise in the future;\n\u2022\npotential advertisers may not view the Post-Showtime Inventory as attractive due to inability to run across our entire network or view it as a premium advertising opportunity and the average CPMs for the Noovie pre-show may not increase as much as anticipated, or at all;\n\u2022\nNCM LLC may not satisfy the minimum average CPM which is required by the 2019 ESA Amendments for it to have the right to display the Platinum Spot for more than one concurrent advertiser;\n\u2022\nthe extended length of time between the advertised showtime and the beginning of the feature film may decrease the average CPM for that portion of the Noovie pre-show appearing before the advertised showtime, which may partially or fully offset any increase in average CPM for the Post-Showtime Inventory; and\n\u2022\nthe increased theater access fees payable to Cinemark and Regal in connection with the Post-Showtime Inventory and revenue share applicable to the Platinum Spot may exceed the increase, if any, in revenue resulting from the 2019 ESA Amendments.\nThe anticipated benefits we expect to receive as a result of the 2019 ESA Amendments are subject to factors that we do not and cannot control. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits could result in decreases in revenue and Adjusted OIBDA and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be successful in increasing the number of theaters in which NCM LLC has the right to display Post-Showtime Inventory.\nAs a result of the 2019 ESA Amendments, NCM LLC is entitled to display up to five minutes of the Noovie pre-show after the scheduled showtime of a feature film and a Platinum Spot that is either 30 or 60 seconds of the Noovie pre-show in the trailer position directly prior to the \u201cattached\u201d trailers preceding the feature film. However, at this time NCM LLC is only displaying Post-Showtime Inventory in Cinemark and Regal operated theaters, which constituted approximately 54.0% of the attendance in our network as of December 26, 2019. We have entered into agreements to provide similar access to inventory as the 2019 ESA Amendments with ten of our other current network affiliates, and we expect that the inventory will begin to be displayed in these network affiliates theaters throughout 2020.\nWhile we intend to seek to enter into agreements that provide similar access to inventory as the 2019 ESA Amendments with more of our current network affiliates and other potential network affiliates, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in increasing either the number of theaters of current network affiliates or potential network affiliates in which NCM LLC has the right to display advertising, including Post-Showtime Inventory. AMC, which constituted approximately 28.9% of the attendance in our network as of December 26, 2019, has announced that it has no plans to introduce commercial advertising close to the start of a feature film\u2019s commencement. In addition, any agreements with other network affiliates or new network affiliates may be on terms less favorable to us than the current network affiliate agreements and the 2019 ESA Amendments. If we are unable to expand the number of theaters displaying our advertising, including the Post-Showtime Inventory, we will be limited to only experiencing the benefit of our advertising in our current theaters and our post-showtime advertising, if any, in Cinemark, Regal and participating affiliate theaters.\nChanges in the ESAs with, or lack of support by, the founding members could adversely affect our revenue, growth and profitability.\nThe ESAs with the founding members are critical to our business. The ESA with AMC has an initial term of 30 years and the ESAs with each of Cinemark and Regal (as amended by the 2019 ESA Amendments) have a term of 34 years, each such term beginning February 13, 2007. Each ESA provides NCM LLC with a five-year right of first refusal for the services that it provides to the founding members, which begins one year prior to the end of the term of each respective ESA. The founding members\u2019 theaters represent approximately 79.6% of the screens and approximately 82.9% of the attendance in our network as of December 26, 2019. If any one of the ESAs was terminated, not renewed at its expiration or found to be unenforceable, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial condition.\nThe ESAs require the continuing cooperation, investment and support of the founding members, the absence of which could adversely affect us. Pursuant to the ESAs, the founding members must make investments to replace digital network equipment within their theaters and equip newly constructed theaters with digital network equipment. If the founding members do not have adequate financial resources or operational strength, and if they do not replace equipment or equip new theaters to maintain the level of operating functionality that we have today, or if such equipment becomes obsolete, we may have to make additional capital expenditures or our advertising revenue and operating margins may decline. In addition, the ESAs give the\nfounding members the right to object to certain content in our Noovie pre-show, including content that competes with us or the applicable founding member. If the founding members do not agree with our decisions on what content, strategic program or partnerships are permitted under the ESAs, we may lose clients and the resulting revenue, which would harm our business. On October 24, 2019, AMC redeemed 197,118 membership units, which were issued to AMC in March 2019 in accordance with the terms of the common unit adjustment agreement with the founding members, in exchange for shares of our common stock. AMC is eligible to be issued additional shares pursuant to the terms of the common unit adjustment agreement. We are uncertain how AMC\u2019s lack of ownership interest in NCM LLC may affect its cooperation with us under its ESA or otherwise going forward.\nOur plans for developing additional digital revenue opportunities may not be implemented and may not be achieved.\nWe have invested significant resources in pursuing potential opportunities for revenue growth, which we describe in this annual report on Form 10-K under \u201cBusiness-Our strategy.\u201d We had 27.2 million and 106.5 million first- and second-party data sets as of December 27, 2018 and December 26, 2019, respectively. These valuable data sets consist of both our own NCM first-party data from our owned-and-operated digital products, and a variety of key second-party data addressable consumer records, including location-based data that allows us to track when our audiences go to the movie theater to see our Noovie pre-show and where they go in the days and weeks afterwards. Our ability to increase our first- and second-party data sets requires us to invest in third-party relationships and develop innovative digital properties that will increase the number of users of our online and mobile advertising network and mobile apps. Our ability to collect and leverage first and second party movie audience data remains at an early stage, is under increasing competitive pressure and may not deliver the future benefits that we are expecting. It is important that we achieve a critical mass of audience data to make our digital offering more attractive to advertisers, including national brands who buy both our national and regional advertising inventory. If we are unable to execute on products relevant to the marketplace or integrate these digital marketing products with our core on-screen and theater lobby products, and if these offerings do not continue to provide relevant data or to grow in importance to advertising clients and agencies, they may not provide a way to help expand our cinema advertising business as it matures and begins to compete with new or improved advertising platforms including online and mobile video services. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments made pursuing additional revenue opportunities.\nThe markets for advertising are competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully.\nThe market for advertising is very competitive. Cinema advertising is a small component of video advertising in the U.S. and thus, we must compete with established, larger and better known national and local media platforms such as cable, broadcast and satellite television networks and other video media platforms including those distributed on the internet and mobile networks. In addition to these video advertising platforms, we compete for advertising directly with several additional media platforms, including radio, various local print media and billboards, and online and mobile advertising. We also compete with several other local and national cinema advertising companies. We expect all of these competitors to devote significant effort to maintaining and growing their business at our expense. We also expect existing competitors and new entrants to the advertising business, most notably the online and mobile advertising companies and video media platforms distributed on the internet and mobile networks, to constantly revise and improve their business models to meet expectations of advertising clients. In addition, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward online and mobile offerings from more traditional media, or toward new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising posts and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as advantageous to the Company as current advertising methods. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, industries, such as retail or consumer products, or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. If we cannot respond effectively to changes in the media marketplace, changes in the advertising market, new entrants or advances by our existing competitors, our business may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the mix of film ratings of the available motion pictures, such as a higher proportion of G and PG rated films, could cause advertisers to reduce their spending with us as the theater patrons for these films may not represent those advertisers\u2019 target markets.\nAdvertising demand also impacts the price (CPM) we are able to charge our clients. Due to increased competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, television networks and other out-of-home video, combined with seasonal marketplace supply and demand characteristics, we have experienced volatility in our pricing (CPMs) over the years, with annual national CPM increases (decreases) ranging from (4.2%) to 9.7% from 2015 to 2019.\nIf we do not continue to upgrade our technology, our business could fail to grow and revenue and operating margins could decline.\nFailure to successfully or cost-effectively implement upgrades to our in-theater advertising network and proposal and inventory control, audience targeting and other management systems could limit our ability to offer our clients innovative unique, integrated and targeted marketing products, which could limit our future revenue growth. New advertising platforms such as online and mobile networks, and traditional mediums including television networks are beginning to use new digital technology to reach a broader audience with more targeted marketing products, and failure by us to upgrade our technology could hurt our ability to compete with those companies. Under the ESAs, the founding members are required to provide technology that is consistent with that in place at the signing of the ESA. We may request that the founding members upgrade the equipment or software installed in their theaters, but we must negotiate with the founding members as to the terms of such upgrade, including cost sharing terms, if any. If we are not able to come to an agreement on a future upgrade request, we may elect to pay for the upgrades requested which could result in our incurring significant capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our results.\nWe also have many internally developed systems which support our operations due to the unique nature of our business model. The failure to continue to develop or the failure of the system to meet our needs may require us to make significant additional investments in our infrastructure or seek alternative technology which may impact our costs and prevent our growth. In order to address this risk, we expect to implement a new licensed sales planning, proposal and inventory tracking system in 2021 which will replace many of our internally developed systems and house the end to end sales process from proposal to inventory delivery. We expect that the system will achieve a more seamless digital buying experience required by today's media buyers and solve the speed-to-market friction issues associated with our cinema product. The system will also interface with our accounting system thus driving client invoicing and revenue recognition. Given the pervasive impact of this new system on the Company's processes, the failure or delay in implementation of the system or problems with the integration with our other systems and software could cause operational difficulties and slow or prevent the growth of our business in the future. In addition, the failure or delay in implementation of such upgrades or problems with the integration of our systems and software could slow or prevent the growth of our business. Also, as we continue to move our technology to cloud based SaaS platforms, we will continue to reduce our annual capital expenditure spending. However, operating expenses associated with the SaaS licenses will increase and the costs of implementing this system and the related ongoing service costs may exceed our current estimates. Certain implementation costs of our SaaS platforms are capitalized during the implementation period and expensed to operating income over the term of the SaaS contract.\nEconomic uncertainty or deterioration in economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe financial markets have experienced extreme disruption and volatility at times. A decline in consumer spending in the U.S. may lead to decreased demand for our services or delay in payments by our advertising clients. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. These challenging economic conditions also may result in:\n\u2022\nincreased competition for fewer advertising and entertainment programming dollars;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue and gross margin;\n\u2022\ndeclining attendance and thus a decline in the impressions available for our pre-show;\n\u2022\nreduced credit availability and/or access to capital markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty forecasting, budgeting and planning due to limited visibility into the spending plans of current or prospective clients; or\n\u2022\nclient financial difficulty and increased risk of uncollectible accounts.\nOur Adjusted OIBDA is derived from high margin advertising revenue. The reduction in spending by or loss of a national or group of local advertisers or failure to grow our advertising revenue in line with the growth of our contractual costs could have a meaningful adverse effect on our business.\nWe generate all of our operating income and Adjusted OIBDA from our high margin advertising business. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if they believe our advertising medium is ineffective or overly expensive. In addition, large advertisers generally have set advertising budgets, most of which are focused on online and mobile networks and traditional media platforms like television. Reductions in the size of advertisers\u2019 budgets due to local or national economic trends, a shift in spending to advertising mediums like the internet and mobile platforms or other factors could result in lower spending on cinema advertising. Advertisers are spending in the scatter market closer to the start date of their advertising campaign. A substantial portion of our advertising revenue relates to contracts with terms of a month or less, and clients have many video media choices and can adjust where ads are placed up until their airdates without the risk of securing desired impressions. We have been successful in increasing the dollar value of upfront advertising agreements, but as advertising spending shifts in the\nscatter market closer to the start date of advertising campaigns, our ability to maintain high CPMs in the upfront markets may decrease. Because of the high incremental margins on our individual advertising contracts, if we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertising clients, they may reduce their advertising purchases or stop placing advertisements with us. Even the loss of a small number of clients on large contracts would negatively affect our results.\nIn addition, the ESAs and certain of our network affiliate agreements include automatic annual cost or fee increases. The theater access fees under the ESAs are composed of a fixed payment per patron, increasing by 8% every five years, and a fixed payment per digital screen connected to the DCN, increases annually by 5%. The digital screen fees may exceed the traditional theater access fees in the future because of the higher rate of growth of the digital screen fees. In addition, pursuant to the 2019 ESA Amendments, we have agreed to pay a fixed payment per patron in consideration for NCM LLC\u2019s access to certain on-screen advertising inventory after the advertised showtime of a feature film, which amount will increase by fixed amounts until November 1, 2022 and then increase by 8% every five years beginning November 1, 2027. If we are unable to grow our high margin advertising revenue at a rate at least equal to that of our contractual obligations, our margins and results would be negatively affected.\nThe loss of any major content partner or advertising client could significantly reduce our revenue.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from our contracts with our content partners, PSAs and NCM LLC\u2019s founding members\u2019 agreements to purchase on-screen advertising for their beverage concessionaires. We are not direct parties to the agreements between the founding members\u2019 and their beverage concessionaires but expect that each founding member will have an agreement with a beverage concessionaire to provide advertising for the foreseeable future. None of these companies individually accounted for over 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 26, 2019. However, the agreements with the content partners, PSAs and beverage advertising with the founding members in aggregate accounted for approximately 23% and 26% of our total revenue during the years ended December 26, 2019 and December 27, 2018, respectively. Because we derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from a relatively small number of large companies, the loss of one or more of them as a customer could decrease our revenue and adversely affect current and future operating results.\nThe ESAs allow the founding members to engage in activities that might compete with certain elements of our business, which could reduce our revenue and growth potential.\nThe ESAs contain certain limited exceptions to our exclusive right to use the founding members\u2019 theaters for our advertising business. The founding members have the right to enter into a limited number of strategic cross-marketing relationships with third-party, unaffiliated businesses for the purpose of generating increased attendance or revenue (other than revenue from the sale of advertising). These strategic marketing relationships can include the use of one minute on the LEN per 30-minute cycle and certain types of lobby promotions and can be provided at no cost, but only for the purpose of promoting the products or services of those businesses while at the same time promoting the theater circuit or the movie-going experience. The use of LEN or lobby promotions by the founding members for these advertisements and programs could result in the founding members creating relationships with advertisers that could adversely affect our current LEN and lobby promotions advertising revenue and profitability, as well as the potential we have to grow that advertising revenue in the future. The LEN and lobby promotions represented approximately 4.7% of our total advertising revenue for the year ended December 26, 2019. The founding members do not have the right to use their movie screens (including the Noovie pre-show or otherwise) for promoting these cross-marketing relationships, and thus we will have the exclusive rights to advertise on the movie screens, except for limited advertising related to theater operations.\nThe founding members also have the right to install a second network of video monitors in the theater lobbies in excess of those required to be installed for the LEN, and the founding members have exercised this right to install a significant number of video monitors in their theater lobbies. This additional lobby video network, which we refer to as the founding members\u2019 lobby network, may be used by the founding members to promote products or services related to operating the theaters, such as concessions, bars and dining operations, online ticketing partner promotions, gift card and loyalty programs, and special events. The presence of the founding members\u2019 lobby network within the lobby areas could reduce the effectiveness of our LEN, thereby reducing our current LEN advertising revenue and profitability and adversely affecting future revenue potential associated with that marketing platform.\nWe depend upon our senior management and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot retain or replace them.\nOur success depends in part upon the retention of our experienced senior management with specialized industry, sales and technical knowledge and/or industry relationships. In November 2018, our Chief Executive Officer stepped down and a new Chief Executive Officer was appointed in August 2019. Our Chief Financial Officer will retire following the later of March 12,\n2020 or the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company has engaged a national search firm and is in the process of identifying a new Chief Financial Officer. If we are not able to find qualified internal or external replacements for critical members of our senior management team, the loss of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy and our relationships with advertisers and content partners. We do not have key-man life insurance covering any of our employees.\nIf the non-competition provisions of the ESAs are deemed unenforceable, the founding members could compete against us and our business could be adversely affected.\nWith certain limited exceptions, each of the ESAs prohibits the applicable founding member from engaging in any of the business activities that we provide in the founding member\u2019s theaters under the amended ESAs, and from owning interests in other entities that compete with us. These provisions are intended to prevent the founding members from harming our business by providing cinema advertising services directly to their theaters or by entering into agreements with third-party cinema advertising providers. However, under state and federal law, a court may determine that a non-competition covenant is unenforceable, in whole or in part, for reasons including, but not limited to, the court\u2019s determination that the covenant:\n\u2022\nis not necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement;\n\u2022\nunreasonably restrains the party against whom enforcement is sought; or\n\u2022\nis contrary to the public interest.\nEnforceability of a non-competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought. For this reason, it is not possible for us to predict whether, or to what extent, a court would enforce the non-competition provisions contained in the ESAs. If a court were to determine that the non-competition provisions are unenforceable, the founding members could compete directly against us or enter into an agreement with another cinema advertising provider that competes against us. Any inability to enforce the non-competition provisions, in whole or in part, could cause our revenue to decline.\nIf one of the founding members declared bankruptcy, the ESA with that founding member may be rejected, renegotiated or deemed unenforceable.\nEach of the founding members currently has a significant amount of indebtedness. In 2000 and 2001, several major motion picture exhibition companies filed for bankruptcy including United Artists, Edwards Theatres and Regal Cinemas (which are part of Regal), and General Cinemas and Loews Cineplex (which are part of AMC). The industry-wide construction of larger, more expensive megaplexes featuring stadium seating in the late 1990s that rendered existing, smaller, sloped-floor theaters under long-term leases obsolete and unprofitable, were significant contributing factors to these bankruptcies. If a bankruptcy case were commenced by or against a founding member, it is possible that all or part of the ESA with that founding member could be rejected by a trustee in the bankruptcy case pursuant to Section 365 or Section 1123 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or by the founding member, and thus not be enforceable. Alternatively, the founding member could seek to renegotiate the ESA in a manner less favorable to us than the existing agreement. Should the founding member seek to sell or otherwise dispose of theaters or remove theaters from our network through bankruptcy or for other business reasons, if the acquirer did not agree to continue to allow us to sell advertising in the acquired theaters the number of theaters in our advertising networks would be reduced which in turn would reduce the number of advertising impressions available to us and thus could reduce our advertising revenue.\nThe founding members and our network affiliates are subject to substantial government regulation, which could slow their future growth of locations and screens and in turn slow our growth prospects.\nThe founding members and our network affiliates are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting their movie theater business, including provisions regulating antitrust, health and sanitation standards, access for those with disabilities, environmental, and licensing. Some of these laws and regulations also apply directly to us and NCM LLC. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on the founding members, our network affiliates\u2019 and our respective businesses. For example, to the extent that antitrust laws, regulation and enforcement policy restrict the ability of the founding members or the network affiliates to acquire additional theaters, it may slow the future growth of those founding members or network affiliates and in turn the growth of our network.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage changes to our business strategy to continue the growth of our advertising inventory and network.\nIf we do not effectively implement the changes within our strategy, we may not be able to continue our historical growth. To effectively execute on our strategy to expand our digital offerings and continue to grow our inventory, we will need to\ndevelop additional products. These enhancements and improvements could require an additional allocation of financial and management resources and acquisition of talent. High turnover, loss of specialized talent or insufficient capital could also place significant demands on management, the success of the organization, and our strategic outlook.\nThe amount of inventory we have to sell is limited by the length of the Noovie pre-show. In order to maintain in-theater growth we will need to expand the number of theaters and screens in our network. Considering our current market share, we may not be able to continue to expand our network which could negatively affect our ability to add new advertising clients. If we are unable to maintain the size of our network, or grow our network, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nOur business relies heavily on our technology systems, and any failures or disruptions may materially and adversely affect our operations.\nIn order to conduct our business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and support a variety of business processes and activities. The temporary or permanent loss of our computer equipment, audience data or software systems through cyber and other security threats, termination of a material technology license or contract, operating malfunction, software virus, human error, natural disaster, power loss, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and cause a material adverse impact. These problems may arise in both internally developed systems and the systems of third-party service providers. We devote significant resources to maintaining a disaster recovery location separate from our operations, network security and other measures to protect our network from unauthorized access and misuse. However, depending on the nature and scope of a disruption, if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way through our disaster recovery site, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of clients and could harm our reputation. Technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements.\nOur business, services, or technology may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others, which may interfere with our ability to provide services or expose us to increased liability or expense.\nIntellectual property rights of our business include the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents of our in-theater, online, and mobile services, including the websites we operate at ncm.com and Noovie.com, our digital gaming products including Noovie Arcade, Fantasy Movie League, Name That Movie and Noovie Shuffle, and the features and functionality, content, and software we make available through those websites and apps. We rely on our own intellectual property rights as well as intellectual property rights obtained from third parties to conduct our business and provide our in-theater, online, and mobile services. We may discover that our business or the technology we use to provide our in-theater, online, or mobile services infringes patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights owned by others. In addition, our competitors or others may claim rights in patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to provide our in-theater, online, or mobile services either in the U.S. or in international markets. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.\nThe content we distribute through our in-theater, online or mobile services may expose us to liability.\nOur in-theater, online, and mobile services facilitate the distribution of content. This content includes advertising-related content, as well as movie, television, music, gaming and other media content, much of which is obtained from third parties. Our websites and social media channels also include features enabling users to upload or add their own content to the websites and modify certain content on the websites. As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, or other claims based on the content that we distribute. We or entities that we license content from may not be adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us.\nThe user information we collect and maintain through our online and mobile services may expose us to liability.\nIn order to take advantage of some of the online and mobile services we provide, users may, now or in the future, be required to establish an account on one of our websites. As a result, we may collect and maintain personal information about those users. We also may, now or in the future, collect and maintain information about users who view certain advertising displayed through our online and mobile services and users who enter the theaters in our network. The collection and use of this information is governed by applicable privacy, information security and consumer protection-related laws and regulations. These laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and adversely impact our ability to interact with users of our online and mobile services. Our collection and use of information, including personal information, regarding users of our online and mobile services could result in legal liability. For example, the failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy\ninformation security or consumer protection-related laws or regulations or our posted privacy policies could result in actions against us by governmental entities or others. If an actual or perceived breach of our data occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose users of these services and the associated benefits from gathering such user data.\nChanges in regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our online or mobile services may result in the need to alter our business practices or incur greater operating expenses.\nA number of regulations, including those referenced below, may impact our business as a result of our online or mobile services. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, liability for posting, or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights. Portions of the Communications Decency Act are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. The Child Online Protection Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. The California Consumer Protection Act and other privacy laws give residents of certain states additional rights with regards to their personal information. The costs of compliance with these regulations, and other regulations relating to our online and mobile services or other areas of our business, may be significant. The manner in which these and other regulations may be interpreted or enforced may subject us to potential liability, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Changes to these and other regulations may impose additional burdens on us or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results because of, for example, increased costs relating to legal compliance, defense against adverse claims or damages, or the reduction or elimination of features, functionality or content from our online or mobile services. Likewise, any failure on our part to comply with these and other regulations may subject us to additional liabilities.\nOur revenue and Adjusted OIBDA fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, which could increase the volatility of our stock price.\nA weak advertising market or the shift in spending of a major client from one quarter to another, the performance of films released in a given quarter, a disruption in the release schedule of films or changes in the television scatter market could significantly affect quarter-to-quarter results or even affect results for the entire fiscal year. In addition, our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature, coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and, to a lesser extent, the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry. Advertising expenditures tend be higher during the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters. Because our results may vary from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, our financial results for one quarter cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or the same quarter in prior years and may not be indicative of our financial performance in subsequent quarters. These variations in our financial results could contribute to volatility in our stock price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and as a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on distributions and payments under the NCM LLC operating and management services agreements from NCM LLC to meet our ongoing obligations and to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own and have no independent ability to generate cash flow other than interest income on cash balances. Consequently, our ability to obtain operating funds primarily depends upon distributions from NCM LLC. The distribution of cash flows and other transfers of funds by NCM LLC to us are subject to statutory and contractual restrictions based upon NCM LLC\u2019s financial performance, including NCM LLC\u2019s compliance with the covenants\nin its senior secured credit facility and indentures, and the NCM LLC operating agreement. The NCM LLC senior secured credit facility and indentures limit NCM LLC\u2019s ability to distribute cash to its members, including us, based upon certain leverage tests, with exceptions for, among other things, payment of our income taxes and a management fee to NCM, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the management services agreement (incorporated in the ESA). Refer to the information provided under Note 10 to the audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document for leverage discussion. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including NCM LLC\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in NCM LLC\u2019s debt agreements and legal requirements. In the event NCM LLC fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to distribute cash to us quarterly, once NCM, Inc. cash balances and investments are extinguished, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders or pay other expenses outside the ordinary course of business.\nPursuant to the management services agreement between us and NCM LLC, NCM LLC makes payments to us to fund our day-to-day operating expenses, such as payroll. However, if NCM LLC has insufficient cash flow to make the payments pursuant to the management services agreement, we may be unable to cover these expenses.\nAs a member of NCM LLC, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of NCM LLC. We have structured the NCM LLC senior secured credit facility and indentures to allow NCM LLC to distribute cash to its members (including us and NCM LLC\u2019s other members) in amounts sufficient to cover their tax liabilities and management fees, if any. To the extent that NCM LLC has insufficient cash flow to make such payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nNCM LLC\u2019s substantial debt obligations could impair our financial condition or prevent us from achieving our business goals.\nNCM LLC is party to substantial debt obligations. The senior secured credit facility and indentures contain restrictive covenants that limit NCM LLC\u2019s ability to take specified actions and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that NCM LLC must meet. Because NCM LLC is our only operating subsidiary, complying with these restrictions may prevent NCM LLC from taking actions that we believe would help us to grow our business. For example, NCM LLC may be unable to make acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures as a result of such covenants. Moreover, if NCM LLC violates those restrictive covenants or fails to meet the minimum financial requirements, it would be in default, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other obligations of NCM LLC. Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. For further information, refer to Note 10 to the audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nIf NCM LLC is unable to meet its debt service obligations, it could be forced to restructure or refinance the obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets. NCM LLC may be unable to restructure or refinance these obligations, obtain additional equity financing, sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all or make cash distributions. In addition, NCM LLC\u2019s indebtedness could have other negative consequences for us, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nlimiting NCM LLC\u2019s ability to obtain financing in the future;\n\u2022\nrequiring much of NCM LLC's cash flow to be dedicated to interest obligations and making it unavailable for other purposes, including payments to its members (including NCM, Inc.);\n\u2022\nlimiting NCM LLC\u2019s liquidity and operational flexibility in changing economic, business and competitive conditions which could require NCM LLC to consider deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling assets, restructuring existing debt or deferring acquisitions or other strategic opportunities; and\n\u2022\nmaking NCM LLC more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in operating performance or decline in general economic conditions.\nDespite NCM LLC\u2019s current levels of debt, it, or NCM, Inc. may still incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, which would increase the risks associated with NCM LLC\u2019s level of debt\nThe agreements relating to NCM LLC\u2019s debt, including the Notes due 2026 and Notes due 2028 and the senior secured credit facility, limit but do not prohibit NCM LLC\u2019s ability to incur additional debt, and do not place any restrictions on NCM, Inc.\u2019s ability to incur debt. Accordingly, NCM, Inc. or NCM LLC could incur additional debt in the future, including additional debt under the senior secured credit facility, additional senior or senior subordinated notes and additional secured debt. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the related risks that we now face, including those described above under \u201cNCM LLC\u2019s substantial debt obligations could impair our financial condition or prevent us from achieving our business goals,\u201d could intensify.\nNCM LLC\u2019s other founding members or their affiliates may have interests that differ from those of our public stockholders and they may be able to influence our affairs.\nSo long as either Cinemark or Regal owns at least 5% of NCM LLC\u2019s issued and outstanding common membership units, if the two directors appointed by Cinemark or the two directors appointed by Regal to our Board of Directors (except that if either Cinemark or Regal has only appointed one director, and such director qualifies as an \u201cindependent director\u201d under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, then such director) vote against any of the corporate actions listed below, we and NCM LLC will be prohibited from taking any such actions:\n\u2022\nassign, transfer, sell or pledge all or a portion of the membership units of NCM LLC beneficially owned by NCM, Inc.;\n\u2022\nacquire, dispose, lease or license assets with an aggregate value exceeding 20% of the fair market value of the business of NCM LLC operating as a going concern;\n\u2022\nmerge, reorganize, recapitalize, reclassify, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or enter into a similar transaction;\n\u2022\nincur any funded indebtedness or repay, before due, any funded indebtedness with a fixed term in an aggregate amount in excess of $15.0 million per year;\n\u2022\nissue, grant or sell shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, preferred stock or rights with respect to common or preferred stock, or NCM LLC membership units or rights with respect to membership units, except under specified circumstances;\n\u2022\namend, modify, restate or repeal any provision of NCM, Inc.\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or the NCM LLC operating agreement;\n\u2022\nenter into, modify or terminate certain material contracts not in the ordinary course of business as defined under applicable securities laws;\n\u2022\nexcept as specifically set forth in the NCM LLC operating agreement, declare, set aside or pay any redemption of, or dividends with respect to membership interests;\n\u2022\namend any material terms or provisions (as defined in the Nasdaq rules) of NCM, Inc.\u2019s equity incentive plan or enter into any new equity incentive compensation plan;\n\u2022\nmake any change in the current business purpose of NCM, Inc. to serve solely as the manager of NCM LLC or any change in the current business purpose of NCM LLC to provide the services as set forth in the ESAs; and\n\u2022\napprove any actions relating to NCM LLC that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse tax effect on NCM LLC\u2019s founding members.\nPursuant to a director designation agreement, so long as Cinemark or Regal owns at least 5% of NCM LLC\u2019s issued and outstanding common membership units, such NCM LLC founding member will have the right to designate a total of two nominees to our Board of Directors who will be voted upon by our stockholders. One such designee by each of Cinemark and Regal must meet the independence requirements of the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If, at any time, Cinemark or Regal owns less than 5% of NCM LLC\u2019s then issued and outstanding common membership units, then such NCM LLC founding member shall cease to have any rights of designation. AMC no longer has seats on our Board of Directors or the right to nominate any person to serve on our Board of Directors.\nIf any director designee to our Board of Directors designated by Cinemark or Regal is not appointed to our Board of Directors, nominated by us or elected by our stockholders, as applicable, then Cinemark and Regal (so long as such they each continue to own at least 5% of NCM LLC\u2019s issued and outstanding common membership units) will be entitled to approve specified actions of NCM LLC.\nFor purposes of calculating the 5% ownership threshold for the director veto rights and director designation agreement provisions discussed above, shares of our common stock held by a founding member and received upon redemption of NCM LLC common membership units will be counted toward the threshold. Common membership units issued to NCM, Inc. in connection with the redemption of common membership units by an NCM LLC founding member will be excluded, so long as such NCM LLC founding member continues to hold the common stock acquired through such redemption or such NCM LLC founding member has disposed of such shares of common stock to another NCM LLC founding member. Shares of our common stock otherwise acquired by NCM LLC\u2019s founding members will also be excluded, unless such shares of common stock were transferred by one founding member to another and were originally received by the transferring NCM LLC founding member upon redemption of NCM LLC common membership units.\nUnder these circumstances, our corporate governance documents allow NCM LLC\u2019s other members and their affiliates to exercise a greater degree of influence in the operation of our business and that of NCM LLC and the management of our affairs and those of NCM LLC than is typically available to stockholders of a publicly-traded company. Even if NCM LLC\u2019s other members or their affiliates own a minority economic interest (but not less than 5%) in NCM LLC, they may be able to continue exerting such degree of influence over us and NCM LLC.\nDifferent interests among the founding members or between the founding members and us could prevent us from achieving our business goals.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect that our Board of Directors will include directors and certain executive officers of Cinemark and Regal and other directors who may have commercial or other relationships with Cinemark and Regal. The majority of NCM LLC\u2019s outstanding membership interests also are owned by Cinemark and Regal. Such members compete with each other in the operation of their respective businesses and could have individual business interests that may conflict. Their differing interests could make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among NCM LLC\u2019s current members. In addition, to the extent the founding members sell some or all their NCM LLC membership units, such as was the case for AMC during 2017, 2018 and 2019, the founding members could have increasingly different interests because they no longer mutually benefit from an increase in NCM LLC\u2019s revenues or the value of the NCM, Inc. common stock into which the NCM LLC membership units are convertible.\nIn addition, the structural relationship we have with NCM LLC\u2019s founding members could create conflicts of interest among NCM LLC\u2019s founding members, or between NCM LLC\u2019s founding members and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. These conflicts of interests could also increase upon the sale of NCM LLC membership units by a founding member because the founding member would have little incentive to agree to changes that may result in higher revenue for NCM LLC or a higher price for our common stock. There is not any formal dispute resolution procedure in place to resolve conflicts between us and an NCM LLC founding member or between NCM LLC founding members. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and an NCM LLC founding member and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable NCM LLC\u2019s members to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to NCM LLC\u2019s other members and us. It provides that if a corporate opportunity is offered to us, NCM LLC or one or more of the officers, directors or stockholders (both direct and indirect) of NCM, Inc. or a member of NCM LLC that relates to the provision of services to motion picture theaters, use of theaters for any purpose, sale of advertising and promotional services in and around theaters and any other business related to the motion picture theater business (except services as provided in the ESAs as from time to time amended and except as may be offered to one of our officers in his capacity as an officer), no such person shall be liable to us or any of our stockholders (or any affiliate thereof) for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to us. This provision may apply even if the business opportunity is one that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation and the NCM LLC operating agreement expressly provide that NCM LLC\u2019s founding members may have other business interests and may engage in any other businesses not specifically prohibited by the terms of the certificate of incorporation, including the exclusivity provisions of the ESAs. The parent companies of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members could develop new media platforms that could compete for advertising dollars with our services. Further, we may also compete with NCM LLC\u2019s founding members or their affiliates in the area of employee recruiting and retention. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by NCM LLC\u2019s founding members to themselves or their other affiliates or we lose key personnel to them.\nThe agreements between us and NCM LLC\u2019s founding members were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe ESAs and the other contractual agreements that we have with NCM LLC\u2019s founding members were originally negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members and their affiliates comprised our entire Board of Directors. As a result, the financial provisions and the other terms of these agreements, such as covenants, contractual obligations on our part and on the part of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members and termination and default provisions may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover protections that may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our Company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the NCM LLC operating agreement, and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nprovide veto rights to the directors designated by Cinemark and Regal over certain actions specified in our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates.\nNCM LLC\u2019s operating agreement also provides that NCM LLC\u2019s other members will be able to exercise a greater degree of influence over the operations of NCM LLC, which may discourage other nominations to our Board of Directors, if any director nominee designated by NCM LLC\u2019s other members is not elected by our stockholders. In addition, we entered into a letter agreement with Standard General L.P., our largest stockholder, on June 1, 2018, that contains customary standstill provisions that may discourage a third party from seeking to enter into a strategic transaction with us.\nThese restrictions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of us or NCM LLC. Further, these restrictions could restrict or limit certain investors from owning our stock.\nAny future issuance of membership units by NCM LLC and subsequent redemption of such units for common stock could dilute the voting power of our existing common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nThe common unit adjustment agreement and the ESAs provide that NCM LLC will issue common membership units to account for changes in the number of theater screens NCM LLC\u2019s founding members operate and which are made part of our advertising network. Historically, in most years each of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members has increased the number of screens it operates. If this trend continues, NCM LLC may issue additional common membership units to NCM LLC\u2019s founding members to reflect their increase in net screen count. Each common membership unit may be redeemed in exchange for, at our option, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the market price of one share of our common stock. If a significant number of common membership units were issued to NCM LLC\u2019s founding members, NCM LLC\u2019s founding members elected to redeem such units, and we elected to issue common stock rather than cash upon redemption, the voting power of our common stockholders could be diluted. Other than the maximum number of authorized shares of common stock in our certificate of incorporation, there is no limit on the number of shares of our common stock that we may issue upon redemption of an NCM LLC founding member\u2019s common membership units in NCM LLC. For further information, refer to Note 5 to the audited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOur future issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of our common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock, either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.\nIf we or NCM LLC\u2019s founding members are determined to be an investment company, we would become subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and our business activities could be restricted.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As sole manager of NCM LLC, we control NCM LLC, and our interest in NCM LLC is not an \u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we were to stop participating in the management of NCM LLC, our interest in NCM LLC could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally, a company is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding U.S. government securities and cash items). Our sole material asset is our equity interest in NCM LLC. A determination that such asset was an investment security could result in our being considered an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, we would become subject to registration and other burdensome requirements of the Investment Company Act. In addition, the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 could restrict our business activities, including our ability to issue securities.\nWe and NCM LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we are not deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if anything were to occur that would cause us to be deemed an investment company, we would become subject to restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940. These restrictions, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operations.\nWe also rely on representations of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members that they are not investment companies under the Investment Company Act. If any NCM LLC founding member were deemed an investment company, the restrictions placed upon that NCM LLC founding member might inhibit its ability to fulfill its obligations under its ESA or restrict NCM LLC\u2019s ability to borrow funds.\nOur TRA with NCM LLC\u2019s founding members is expected to reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us and will increase our potential exposure to the financial condition of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members.\nOur initial public offering and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in its proportionate share of tax basis in NCM LLC\u2019s tangible and intangible assets. We have agreed in our TRA with NCM LLC\u2019s founding members to pay to NCM LLC\u2019s founding members 90% of the amount by which NCM, Inc.\u2019s tax payments to various tax authorities are reduced as a result of the increase in tax basis. After paying these reduced amounts to tax authorities, if it is determined as a result of an income tax audit or examination that any amount of NCM, Inc.\u2019s claimed tax benefits should not have been available, NCM, Inc. may be required to pay additional taxes and possibly penalties and interest to one or more tax authorities. If this were to occur and if one or more of NCM LLC\u2019s founding members was insolvent or bankrupt or otherwise unable to make payment under its indemnification obligation under the TRA, then NCM, Inc.\u2019s financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nThe substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale could cause the market price for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of common stock by Regal, Cinemark, or Standard General will have on the market price of our common stock from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. If we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate, we may be unable to fund growth. Cinemark and Regal may receive up to 81,508,369 shares of common stock as of December 26, 2019 upon redemption of their outstanding common membership units of NCM LLC. The resale of these shares of common stock has been registered as required by the terms of the registration rights agreement between NCM, Inc. and the founding members. Standard General also owns 15,808,390 shares that it may sell at any time. Additionally, once options and restricted stock held by our employees become vested and/or exercisable, as applicable, to the extent that they are not held by one of our affiliates, the shares acquired upon vesting or exercise are freely tradable. Refer to Note 11 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe interests of our largest stockholder and NCM LLC\u2019s other members may be different from or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nStandard General beneficially owns 15,808,390 shares of our common stock, and as of December 26, 2019, Cinemark and Regal held NCM LLC membership interests that are convertible into another 81,508,369 shares of our common stock. As a\nresult, each of Regal, Cinemark and Standard General is in a position to influence or control to some degree the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. Their influence or control of our Company and NCM LLC may have the effect of delaying or promoting a change of control of our Company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other stockholders. In addition, each of Regal, Cinemark and Standard General has the right to designate directors to our Board. These directors have the authority, subject to applicable rules and regulations, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions.\nIt is possible that the interests of Regal, Cinemark and Standard General may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Cinemark and Regal may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the TRA we entered into with founding members that provides for the payment by us to the founding members of 90% of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize. This could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, and whether and when we or NCM LLC should incur indebtedness. As another example, Standard General is in the business of making investments in companies and may hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us.", "PERMNO": 91822, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "NCMI"}
