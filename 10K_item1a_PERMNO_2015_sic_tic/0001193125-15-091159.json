Risk Factors\nA downturn in the local economy or in local real estate values could hurt profits. Most of the Bank\u2019s loans are secured by real estate and are made to borrowers in Ocean, Monmouth, Middlesex and Mercer Counties, New Jersey and the surrounding areas. As a result of this concentration, a downturn in the local economy could cause significant increases in non-performing loans, which could hurt profits. A downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could increase the amount of non-performing loans and cause residential and commercial mortgage loans to become inadequately collateralized, which could expose the Bank to a greater risk of loss.\nFuture natural disasters or hurricanes, or increases to flood insurance premiums could adversely affect asset quality and earnings. The Bank\u2019s trade area includes counties in New Jersey with extensive coastal regions. These areas may be vulnerable to flooding or other damage from future storms or hurricanes. This damage may be as bad as, or worse than, that suffered during superstorm Sandy in 2012. Further storms like this, although rare, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations by disrupting operations, adversely impacting the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans, damaging collateral or reducing the value of real estate used as collateral.\nIn response to the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Return Act of 2012, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is making changes to the way the National Flood Insurance Program is run, including modifying insurance rates to reflect market-based flood risk. While legislative initiatives are currently delaying certain rate changes, it is possible that premium rates will increase over time for some of the Company\u2019s borrowers. These increases may reduce real estate values or impact borrowers\u2019 ability to maintain adequate flood insurance coverage, which may, in turn, adversely impact borrowers ability to repay their loans.\nIncreased emphasis on commercial lending may expose the Bank to increased lending risks. At December 31, 2014, $733.9 million, or 42.6%, of the Bank\u2019s total loans consisted of commercial real estate, multi-family and land loans, and commercial and industrial loans. This portfolio has grown in recent years and the Bank intends to continue to emphasize these types of lending. These types of loans may expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.\nThe extended foreclosure timeline could continue to adversely impact the Bank\u2019s recoveries on non-performing loans. Over the past few years, foreclosure timelines have lengthened due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases and issues with foreclosure policies at several large mortgage loan servicers. These delays were the result of the economic crisis, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, increased documentary requirements and judicial scrutiny, and, both voluntary and mandatory programs under which lenders may consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. The issues at the largest mortgage loan servicers and the potential legal and regulatory responses could impact the foreclosure process and completion time of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders more broadly, which may result in a material adverse effect on collateral values and the Bank\u2019s ability to minimize its losses. The foreclosure process in New Jersey remains protracted which delays the Company\u2019s ability to resolve non-performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the burden is on the lender to demonstrate the appropriateness of its policies and the strength of its controls. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this Ability-To-Repay rule for \u201cQualified Mortgages\u201d. A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The\ncriteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. To be defined as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage, the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a \u201chigher priced loan\u201d as defined in Federal Reserve regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer\u2019s Ability-To-Repay. Additionally, conforming fixed-rate loans with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 43% would also qualify as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage based upon an automated loan approval from one of the government sponsored mortgage entities. However, a consumer may assert the lender\u2019s failure to comply with the Ability-To-Repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages.\nAlthough the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank currently originates residential mortgage loans that do not qualify. As a result of the Ability-to-Repay rules, the Bank may experience decreased mortgage loan origination volume, increased compliance costs, loan losses, litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral in a foreclosure proceeding if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the Ability-To-Repay rule upon originating the loan.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which could hurt the Company\u2019s earnings. The Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may prove to be inadequate to cover actual loan losses and if the Bank is required to increase its allowance, current earnings may be reduced. The Bank provides for losses by reserving what it believes to be an adequate amount to absorb any probable incurred losses. A \u201ccharge-off\u201d reduces the Bank\u2019s reserve for possible loan losses. If the Bank\u2019s reserves were insufficient, it would be required to record a larger reserve, which would reduce earnings for that period.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. The Bank\u2019s ability to make a profit largely depends on net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. The interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Interest-bearing liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed securities. A reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the Bank may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid loans or mortgage-backed securities. Conversely, an increase in interest rates generally reduces prepayments. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current estimated fair value of the interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized net losses on securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of the available-for-sale portfolio decreases, stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nChanges in the fair value of securities may reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and net income. At December 31, 2014, the Company maintained a securities portfolio of $489.2 million, of which $19.8 million was classified as available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on the credit quality of the underlying issuer, market liquidity, changes in interest rates and other factors. Stockholders\u2019 equity is increased or decreased by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of the available-for-sale securities portfolio,\nnet of the related tax expense or benefit, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share. The decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold.\nThe Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the complete securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the estimated fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors which are considered in the analysis include, but are not limited to, the severity and duration of the decline in estimated fair value of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, the intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. If such decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income.\nAt December 31, 2014, the securities portfolio included corporate debt securities issued by national and regional banks. The portfolio consisted of eleven $5.0 million issues spread among eight issuers. At December 31, 2014, the securities had a book value of $55.0 million and an estimated fair value of $45.3 million. The Company may be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge related to these securities if circumstances change.\nThe Bank may be required to repurchase mortgage loans for a breach of representations and warranties, which could harm the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company enters into loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. The loan sale agreements generally require the repurchase of certain loans previously sold in the event of a violation of various representations and warranties customary to the mortgage banking industry. FNMA, FHLMC and investors continue to carefully examine loan documentation on delinquent loans with the goal of increasing the amount of repurchases by the loan originator. The repurchased mortgage loans could typically only be resold at a significant discount to the unpaid principal balance. The Company maintains a reserve for repurchased loans, however, if repurchase activity is significant, the reserve may need to be increased to cover actual losses which could harm future earnings.\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Company is subject to examination and regulation by the FRB. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, its primary Federal regulator, and by the FDIC, as insurer of deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of assets and determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses. The purpose of the laws and regulations that govern the Company and the Bank\u2019s operations are designed for the protection of depositors and the public, but not the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nIn July of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act is a broad legislative initiative that is significantly changing the bank regulatory structure and affecting the operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCC, which is the primary Federal regulator for national banks, became the primary Federal regulator for Federal thrifts such as the Bank and the FRB now supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies, including the Company. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FRB to issue rules to limit debit-card interchange fees, (the fees that issuing banks charge merchants each time a consumer uses a debit card) collected by banks with assets of $10 billion or more. Although exempt from this rule, market forces in future periods, may result in reduced fees charged by all issuers, regardless of asset size, which may result in reduced revenues for the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s revenues from interchange fees was $2.9 million, no change from 2013. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision, General, The Dodd-Frank Act\u201d.\nIn July 2013 the FDIC and the other Federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision, General, The Dodd-Frank Act\u201d.\nThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. Although the Bank has developed policies and procedures designated to comply with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be totally effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nThese provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose the Company to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, many of which are to be phased-in over the next several years, and assessing the probable impact on operations. The ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and the Company in particular, is uncertain at this time.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to originate mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the U.S. government and GSEs in the residential mortgage market. Over the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been a consistently large purchaser of U.S. Treasury and GSE-backed mortgage-backed securities. This remains true despite the recent decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to end their monthly bond buying program. In addition, the Bank has faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market as a result of the economic crisis. The actions of the Federal Reserve and the GSEs have caused the interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low. As a result of these factors, it may be difficult for the Bank to originate mortgage loans and grow the residential mortgage loan portfolio, which could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s earnings.\nThere is no guaranty that the Company will be able to continue to pay a dividend or, if continued, will be able to pay a dividend at the current rate. The Board of Directors of the Company determines at its discretion if, when and the amount of dividends that may be paid on the common stock. In making such determination under the Company\u2019s capital management plan, the Board of Directors takes into account various factors including economic conditions, earnings, liquidity needs, the financial condition of the Company, applicable state law, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Although the Company has a history of paying a quarterly dividend on its common stock, there is no guaranty that such dividends will continue to be paid in the future or at what rate.\nCompetition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect profitability and liquidity. The Company has substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer, in its market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of these competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, stronger regulatory\nratios and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce the Company\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that the Bank originates and the interest rates charged on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, the Company faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of its competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and access to capital, stronger regulatory ratios, stronger asset quality and performance, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than the Company, which could decrease the deposits that the Company attracts or require the Company to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, the Company may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain which could increase the cost of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect earnings. The Bank has expanded its presence within the market area through de novo branching and continually evaluates opportunities for new branches. The profitability of this expansion strategy will depend on whether the income from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. It is expected to take a period of time before these branches or any branches to be opened can become profitable. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect net income.\nThe Company must continue to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality. The Company\u2019s ability to manage growth successfully will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain management and loan officers experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market area. The unexpected loss of service of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could adversely affect the Company. If the Company grows too quickly and is not able to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality, this continued growth could adversely affect the Company.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could disrupt businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of, and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company. Information technology systems are critical to the Company\u2019s business. Various systems are used to manage customer relationships, including deposits and loans, general ledger and securities investments.\nAlthough the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Company\u2019s security measures will provide absolute security. This risk is evidenced by recent events where financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Additionally, there is the risk of distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which are intended to disrupt online services, as well as data breaches due to cyberattacks which result in unauthorized access to customer data.\nDespite the Company\u2019s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types,\nespecially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile and other internet-based product offerings.\nIn addition, a majority of data processing is outsourced to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if there is difficulty communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security of the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s MSR may become impaired which could hurt profits. MSR are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Any impairment is recognized as a reduction to servicing fee income. In the event that loan prepayments accelerate due to increased loan refinancing, the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights would likely decline which could result in an impairment charge which would reduce earnings.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset could be reduced if corporate tax rates in the U.S. are decreased. There have been recent discussions in Congress and by the executive branch regarding potentially decreasing the U.S. corporate tax rate. While the Company may benefit in some respects from any decreases in these corporate tax rates, any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate would result in a decrease to the value of the net deferred tax asset, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83774, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "OCFC"}
