{"cik": "1033012", "company": "FLAGSTAR BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors identified elsewhere in this Report, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business are set forth below.\nMarket, Interest Rate, Credit and Liquidity Risk\nEconomic and general conditions in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by economic and market conditions, political uncertainty and social conditions, factors impacting the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, risks associated with an outbreak of a widespread epidemic or pandemic of disease (or widespread fear thereof), bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and the sustainability of economic growth. Deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our business segments, the level of credit risk we have assumed, our capital levels, liquidity, and our results of operations.\nDomestic and international fiscal and monetary policies also affect our business. Central bank actions, particularly those of the Federal Reserve, can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as investment securities and MSRs, and their policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the cost of running our business.\nWe are asset sensitive, which means changes in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations including our net interest margin, mortgage related assets, and our investment portfolio.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the yield curve. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income represented 47 percent of our total revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2019.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the expected average life of our mortgage LHFI and mortgage backed securities and, to a lesser extent, our commercial loans. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in prepayments of our loans and mortgage backed securities as borrowers refinance to reduce their own borrowing costs. Conversely, increases in interest rates may decrease loan refinance activity which can negatively impact our mortgage business.\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate financial instruments, including certain LHFI, LHFS, and investment securities is affected by changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, the fair value of our fixed-rate financial instruments will generally decline and, therefore, have a negative effect on our financial results. We use derivatives to provide a level of protection against certain interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy will offset this risk completely.\nAdditionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on MSR fair value. Conversely, higher rates typically drive lower repayments which result in an increase in the MSR fair value. We utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs. Our risk management strategies, which rely on assumptions or projections, may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, credit spreads or prepayment speeds, and as a result, the change in the fair value of MSRs may negatively impact earnings.\nRising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue.\nIn 2019, approximately 45 percent of our revenue was derived from our Mortgage Origination segment which includes activities related to the origination and sale of residential mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations, while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease. Therefore, our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates. Historically, mortgage origination volume and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors. An increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. During 2019, average 10 year U.S. Treasury rates, on which we base our pricing of our 30 year mortgages, was 2.14 percent, 77 basis points lower than average rates experienced during 2018. The sustained lower rates experienced throughout 2019 positively impacted the mortgage market including loan origination volume and refinancing activity, which may not persist.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. Adverse market conditions, including increased volatility and reduced market demand, could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. A prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. The cyclical nature of our industry could lead to periods of strong growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of sharp declines and losses in such markets. Seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. One of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans, which is affected by prevailing interest rates, housing supply and demand, residential construction trends, and overall economic conditions. If we are unable to respond to the cyclical nature of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on the Agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate. Changes in these entities, changes in the manor or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold approximately 63 percent of our mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, their concentration limits with respect to loans purchased from us, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may materially adversely affect our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. Their roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements. The elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the servicing, origination, or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way that we originate, underwrite, or service. Guidelines include credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, modification standards and procedures and the amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms with the Agencies and they are subject to change at any time. A significant change in these guidelines which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which oversees LIBOR, formally announced that it could not assure the continued existence of LIBOR in its current form beyond the end of 2021, and that an orderly transition process to one or more alternative benchmarks should begin. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a\nsteering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions organized by the Federal Reserve, announced that it had selected a modified version of the unpublished Broad Treasuries Financing Rate as the preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. dollar obligations. This rate, now referred to as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is based on actual transactions in certain portions of overnight repurchase agreement markets for certain U.S. Treasury obligations, and was first published during the first half of 2018.\nIt is unclear whether, or in what form, LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, revenue and expenses associated with interest rates and underlying valuation assumptions on our loans, deposits, obligations, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates and models that utilize LIBOR curves may be adversely affected. Additionally, whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a replacement to LIBOR remains in question and it remains uncertain at this time what the impact of a possible transition to SOFR or other alternative reference rates may have on our business, financial result and operations.\nTo effectively manage our MSR concentration risk we may have to sell our MSRs when market conditions are not optimal or hold MSRs at a level which is punitive to our Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) under Basel III.\nWe are subject to capital standards requirements, including requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and those developed by the Bank's regulators based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III established a qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including limitations on the amount of DTAs and MSRs that may be held without triggering higher capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2020, Basel III (post regulatory simplification) limits the amount of MSRs and DTAs each to 25 percent of CET1. These limitations could cause a reduction in our capital levels and have a negative impact on our overall business and ability to lend.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $291 million in MSRs and a MSR to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 19.7 percent. We produced, on average, approximately $56 million of new MSRs per quarter in 2019 and we expect to continue to generate MSRs going forward. Considering the volume of MSRs that we generate, we must continually sell MSRs to manage the concentration of this asset. In 2019, we sold $57 million in MSRs and as of December 31, 2019, we had pending MSR sales with a fair value of $35 million which closed during the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, we sold $12.4 billion of outstanding principal via flow sale arrangements, in which Flagstar assigns the servicing right to a third party investor at the time of sale and the rights, risks, and rewards of holding the MSR asset are never titled in the name of Flagstar. While our established plan to manage our MSR concentration incorporates our production volumes and required sales, no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so. Additionally, to manage our MSR concentration, we may have to sell our MSRs at a price less than their fair value due to market constraints present at the time of sale which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRefer to MD&A - Regulatory Capital Simplification and Note 18 for more detail.\nOur ALLL could be too low to sufficiently cover future credit losses. As of December 31, 2019, our ALLL was $107 million, covering 0.9 percent of total loans held-for-investment. Our estimate of the inherent losses is imperfect and based on management judgment.\nOur ALLL, which reflects our estimate of losses inherent in the HFI loan portfolio at December 31, 2019, may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses. If this allowance is insufficient, future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans, but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business. Our ALLL is based on historical experience as well as our evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is a subjective process that requires significant management judgment, including estimates of loss and the loss emergence period, estimates and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including but not limited to the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate or other collateral backing the repayment of loans. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, failure of borrowers and guarantors to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ALLL. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our ALLL and may recommend or require us to increase the amount of our ALLL, based on their judgment, which may be different from that of our management. Any increase in our loan losses would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe FASB accounting standard update to the measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments will result in a significant change in how we estimate credit losses and may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\", which replaces the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under the CECL standard, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loan. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including credit quality, our historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts that may affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and at least quarterly thereafter. This differs significantly from the current \"incurred loss\" model, which delays recognition of estimated losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred and measures those losses over the estimated life of the loan rather than the loss emergence period. Certain CECL factors are outside of our control and may be procyclical and/or create more volatility in the level of our ALL which could impact our results of operations.\nBased on our current results and economic forecasts as of December 31, 2019, the estimated impact of CECL on our ALLL, including our reserve for unfunded loan commitments is expected to be a pre-tax increase of approximately 25 to 35 percent. The impact upon adoption of the CECL standard will be recorded in equity and adverse effects will be phased into regulatory capital over a three year transition period based on the December 21, 2018 Final Rule approved by the regulatory agencies modifying regulatory capital rules. Any future changes to our allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments after January 1, 2020 will be recorded in our provision for credit losses.\nCECL requires management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements, including macroeconomic forecasts, than the previous allowance standard. This is expected to increase the complexity and associated risk, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or other unforeseen circumstances, which could impact our results of operations and may place stress on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment in certain geographic locations and markets may increase the magnitude of potential losses should defaults occur.\nOur residential mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California and Michigan, which comprise approximately 52 percent of the portfolio. In addition, our commercial loan portfolio has a concentration of Michigan lending relationships. Approximately 39 percent of our CRE loans are collateralized by properties in Michigan and 33 percent of our C&I borrowers are located in Michigan. These concentrations have made, and will continue to make, our loan portfolio susceptible to downturns in these local economies and the real estate and mortgage markets in these areas. Adverse conditions that are beyond our control may affect these areas, including unemployment, inflation, recession, natural disasters, declining property values, municipal bankruptcies and other factors which could increase both the probability and severity of defaults in our loan portfolio, reduce our ability to generate new loans and negatively affect our financial results.\nCommercial loans, excluding our warehouse loans, generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans due to the more complex nature of underwriting. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2019, our largest CRE and C&I borrowers had outstanding loans of $70 million and $72 million, respectively. Further, we have commitments up to $100 million in our CRE and C&I portfolios. As such, a default by one of our larger borrowers could result in a significant loss relative to our ALLL. Additionally, secured loans, including residential and commercial real estate, may experience changes in the underlying collateral value due to adverse market conditions which could result in increased charge-offs in the event of a loan default.\nOur home builder finance portfolio reached $989 million in outstanding loans at December 31, 2019. The home builder lending portfolio contains secured and unsecured loans, within our CRE and C&I portfolios, and our lending platform originates loans throughout the U.S. with regional offices in Houston, Phoenix and Denver. Our home builder lending business may be impacted by overall economic conditions in the areas builders operate as well as new home construction rates and trends.\nAt December 31, 2019, our adjustable-rate warehouse lines of credit granted to other mortgage lenders was $4.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion was outstanding. There may be risks associated with the mortgage lenders that borrow from the Bank, including credit risk, inadequate underwriting, and potential fraud against the Bank. At December 31, 2019, our largest\nborrower had an outstanding balance of $100 million. A default by one of our larger warehouse borrowers could result in a large loss relative to our size. Additionally, adverse changes to industry competition, mortgage demand and the interest rate environment may have a negative impact on warehouse lending.\nLiquidity risk may affect our ability to meet obligations and impact our ability to grow our business.\nWe require substantial liquidity to repay our customers' deposits, fulfill loan demand, meet borrowing obligations, and fund our operations under both normal and unforeseen circumstances which may cause liquidity stress. Our liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets, or unforeseen outflows of deposits. Our access to and cost of liquidity, is dependent on various factors including, but not limited to, declining financial results, balance sheet and financial leverage, disruptions in the capital markets, counterparty availability, interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions, and legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions. A material deterioration in these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties, resulting in higher cash outflows which could require us to raise capital or obtain additional access to liquidity. If we are restricted from accessing certain funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on acceptable terms, or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to limit our growth, reduce the number of loans we are able to originate or take actions that could have other negative effects on our operations.\nWe are a holding company and are, therefore, dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank and cash on hand, our ability to service our debt, including interest payments on our senior notes and trust preferred securities, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay for certain services we purchase from the Bank and cover operating expenses, depend upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The holding company had cash and cash equivalents of $233 million at December 31, 2019, or approximately 4.5 years of future anticipated cash outflows, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt service coverage when excluding the redemption of $250 million of senior notes which mature on July 15, 2021. Operating expenses, which include costs paid to the Bank, totaled $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The declaration and payment of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the Bank's Board of Directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations. If the Bank, does not, or cannot, make sufficient dividend payments to us, we may not be able to service or repay our debt when it comes due, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or could cause us to take other actions which could be materially detrimental to our shareholders.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe depend upon having FDIC insurance to raise deposit funding at reasonable rates. Future changes in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution's deposit insurance premiums. Consequently, the FDIC has defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average Tier 1 Capital. Our assessment rate is determined by use of a scorecard that combines our CAMELS ratings with certain other financial information. Changes in the level and mix of these financial components in the scorecard may result in a higher assessment rate. The FDIC may determine that we present a higher risk to the DIF than other banks due to various factors. These factors include significant risks relating to interest rates, loan portfolio and geographic concentration, concentration of high credit risk loans, increased loan losses, regulatory compliance, existing and future litigation and other factors. As a result, we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions and/or operating restrictions.\nWe are subject to government legislation and regulation, including but not limited to the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts, which require financial institutions to develop programs to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. If detected, financial institutions are obligated to report such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury. These regulations require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to establish and maintain a relationship with a financial institution. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, sanctions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our strategic initiatives and operating results, and could require us to make changes to our operations and the customers that we serve.\nCurrent laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change and, in certain instances, state and federal law may conflict. Any new laws and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business. If our risk management and compliance programs prove to be ineffective, incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, our financial condition and/or our reputation. As part of our federal regulators' enforcement authority, significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, consent orders, or other regulatory actions can be assessed against the Bank. Such actions could require us to make changes to our operations, including the customers that we serve, and may have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOperational Risk\nA failure of our information technology systems could cause operational losses and damage to our reputation.\nOur businesses are increasingly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions and data efficiently and accurately. If our internal information technology systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business for a period of time, which may impact our financial results if that interruption is sustained. In addition, our reputation with our customers or business partners may suffer, which could have a further, long-term impact on our financial results.\nOur reliance on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure could cause operational losses or business interruptions.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. The risks associated with the vendor activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. Our Vendor Management department provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships. Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships and is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.\nIncreased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs, regulatory fines or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could result in regulatory noncompliance, adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased costs.\nBecause we conduct part of our business over the Internet and outsource a significant number of our critical functions to third parties, our operations depend on our third-party service providers to maintain and operate their own technology systems. To the extent these third parties\u2019 systems fail, despite our monitoring and contingency plans, we may be unable to conduct business or provide certain services, and we may face financial and reputational losses as a result.\nWe face operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value of transactions we process.\nWe rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a wide variety of transactions. Many of the transactions we process may be of high dollar value, such as those related to mortgage lending and warehouse advances. In 2019, we originated a total of $32.7 billion in residential mortgage loans and processed $55 billion of warehouse lending advances. We\nface operational risk from, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties, compliance failures, cyber-attacks, technology failures, system failures, vendor failures, or unforeseen problems related to system implementations or upgrades, business continuation and disaster recovery issues, and other external events. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a financial loss, regulatory action or damage to our reputation.\nWe may lose market share to our competitors if we are not able to respond to technological change and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technologically depended. We may not be able to respond to technological innovations as quickly as our competitors do. Certain of our competitors are making significantly greater investments and allocating significantly more in financial resources toward technological innovations and digital offerings than we historically have. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers and introduce competitive products in a cost-efficient manner depends on our responsiveness to technological advances, investment in new technology as it becomes available, and obtaining and maintaining related essential personnel. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products by financial technology companies and platforms may adversely affect our ability to maintain our customer base, obtain new customers or successfully grow our business. The failure to respond to the product demands of our customers, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect, store and transfer our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information. Any cybersecurity attack or other compromise to the security of that information could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nCybersecurity related attacks are attempted on an ongoing basis which pose a risk of data breaches relative to the processing of transactions that contain customers\u2019 personally identifiable information. As a part of conducting business, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data either on our network or in the cloud.\nCybersecurity risks for banking institutions have increased significantly in recent years due to new technologies, the reliance on technology to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. A cybersecurity attack, information security breach, phishing or other social engineering could adversely impact our ability to conduct business due to the potential costs for remediation, protection and litigation and reputational damage with customers, business partners and investors. There are myriad federal, state, local and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. We have policies and processes in place that are intended to meet the requirements of those laws, including security systems to prevent unauthorized access to that information. Nevertheless, those processes and systems may be inadequate. Also, to the extent we rely upon third parties to handle personally identifiable data on our behalf, we may be responsible if such data is compromised or subject to a cybersecurity attack while in the custody and control of those third parties.\nPrivacy laws are continually evolving and many state and local jurisdictions have laws that differ from federal law or privacy policies, further some of those policies or laws may conflict. For example, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect in January 2020, provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected, know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom and opt out of the sale of their personal data, among other rights.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state, local or international laws and regulations or experience any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, those events could damage the reputation of our business, and discourage potential users from utilizing our products and services. In addition, insurance may not cover the cost of mitigating identity theft concerns, and may be subject to fines or legal proceedings by governmental agencies or consumers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nServicing revenue makes up approximately 15 percent of our total revenue and contributed approximately $3.8 billion in average custodial deposits during 2019. At December 31, 2019, we had relationships with 7 owners of MSRs, excluding\nourselves, three for which we act as servicer and four for which we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans they own. Due to the limited number of relationships, discontinuation of existing agreements with those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue. The terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause. Additionally, the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and, to the extent allowable, could choose to transfer the oversight of the Bank's custodial deposits to another depository institution. Further, as servicer or subservicer of loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold by us, we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, about the mortgage loans, and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower or we may be required to pay fees. We may also be subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties which may result in significant costs. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit or other losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense. We may incur significant costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and, as a result, our profitability.\nOur representation and warranty reserve, which is based on an estimate of probable future losses, was $5 million at December 31, 2019 with a pipeline of $8 million. The pipeline represents the UPB for loans the Agencies identified as potentially needing to be repurchased and the estimated probable loss associated with these loans is included in the R&W reserve. While we believe the level of the reserve to be appropriate, the reserve may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties and the pipeline could increase substantially without warning. Our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, may review our representation and warranty reserve for losses. Our regulators may recommend or require us to increase our reserve, based on their judgment, which may differ from that of our management.\nWe utilize third party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and operational risk.\nIn 2019, approximately 79 percent of our residential first mortgage volume dependent upon the use of third party mortgage originators, i.e. mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages or provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with, or loyalties to, such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on third party mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate. While we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business and review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank.\nDue to regulatory scrutiny, our third party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule issued by the CFPB establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms, timing of communicating information to borrowers and certain record keeping requirements. The ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs. In addition, these arrangements with third party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and restrictions in the future.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, prohibit discriminatory lending practices by lenders, including financial institutions. Mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws and regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated. As we originate loans through various channels, we, and our third party mortgage originators, are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of or disparate impact to borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, by us or our third party mortgage originators, could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.\nNew lines of business, products or services may subject us to unknown risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or where there is a conflict between state and federal law. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results. New lines of business and/or new products or services also could subject us to additional or conflicting legal or regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny by our regulators and other legal risks.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMP Thrift, an entity managed and controlled by MatlinPatterson, owns 36.4 percent (20,600,352 shares) of our common stock. Future issuance of Flagstar\u2019s common stock in the public market, or as a result of actions taken by MP Thrift, could adversely affect the trading price of Flagstar\u2019s common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, MP Thrift owned 36.4 percent of the Company\u2019s common stock. MP Thrift itself is indirectly owned by investment funds that are affiliates of MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners III LP, a fund that was initially formed in 2007. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by existing shareholders, or the perception that sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Further, a large quantity of our shares introduced into the market, either at once or over time, could increase the supply of our common stock, thereby putting pressure on our stock price. Pricing pressure could be further exacerbated by low trading volumes and market conditions, both of which may impact the time it may take for pricing to rationalize. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement between Flagstar and MP Thrift, we have granted MP Thrift registration rights for the resale of the shares of our common stock and have filed a shelf registration statement to facilitate potential future sales of shares by them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings.\nAt any given time, we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of the routine reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve consumer protection, employment, tort, and numerous other laws and regulations. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities, or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our business. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our\nproducts and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to stockholder class and derivative actions, which could seek significant damages or other relief. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. For further information, see Note 19 - Legal Proceedings, Contingencies and Commitments.\nWe may be required to pay interest on escrow in accordance with certain state laws in spite of the Federal preemption under the National Bank Act\nIn 2018, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that California state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not, as a matter of law, preempted by the National Bank Act (Lusnak v. Bank of America). This ruling goes against the position that regulators, national banks and other federally-chartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of state-law mortgage escrow interest requirements. The opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western United States. We are currently defending similar litigation in California Federal Court, arguing that the Lusnak case was wrongly decided, our situation can be distinguished from Lusnak as a matter of law, and California\u2019s interest on escrow law should be preempted as a matter of fact. If the Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s holding is more broadly adopted by other Federal Circuits, including those covering states that currently have or in the future may enact statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively credit interest on escrow funds, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nLoss of certain personnel, including key members of the Corporation's management team, could adversely affect the Corporation.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon our management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described herein or in any such report or document.", "PERMNO": 84734, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FBC"}
