RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the\nrisks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nReferences to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section refer to the Company and its subsidiary, including the Bank, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur business depends upon the general economic conditions of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and may be adversely affected by downturns in these and the other local economies in which we operate.\nIn recent years, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. has been slow and uneven. Furthermore, there are continuing concerns related to the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. In addition, oil price volatility, the level of U.S. debt and global economic conditions have had a destabilizing effect on financial markets.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate, including the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, the United States and worldwide have shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions, combined with continued oil price volatility, could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate concentrated in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, which may adversely affect our earnings and capital if real estate values decline.\nNearly 77.8% of our total loans are real estate interests (residential, nonresidential including both owner-occupied and investment real estate, and construction and land development) mainly concentrated in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, a relatively small geographic area. As a result, declining real estate values in these markets could negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral securing such loans. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values in satisfaction of any non-performing or defaulted loans, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nOur nonresidential real estate loans expose us to greater risks of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans, which may cause us to increase our allowance for loan losses which would reduce our net income.\nAt December 31, 2016, $772.0 million, or 73.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of nonresidential real estate loans. Nonresidential real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans expose us to additional risks because they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time. These\nloans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Because such loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans, which would reduce our net income. Also, many of our nonresidential real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nOur allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce earnings and capital.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of the Bank\u2019s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. Management performs stress tests on the loan portfolios to estimate future loan losses, but there can be no absolute assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management\u2019s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank\u2019s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. Although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, we cannot predict with absolute certainty the amount of such losses or guarantee that the allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe profitability of MVB Mortgage will be significantly reduced if we are not able to sell mortgages.\nCurrently, we generally sell all of the mortgage loans originated by MVB Mortgage. We only underwrite mortgages that we reasonably expect will have more than one potential purchaser. The profitability of our Mortgage Subsidiary depends in large part upon our ability to originate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market. Thus, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to sell loans into that market.\nMVB Mortgage\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are government-sponsored enterprises with substantial market influence whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government-sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non-institutional investors or any impairment of our ability to participate in such programs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nOur largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and borrowings. Moreover, the loans included in our interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of variable and adjustable rate loans. Net interest income is subject to interest rate risk in the following ways:\n\u2022\nIn general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities. The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.\n\u2022\nThe remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income. Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to maturity (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.\n\u2022\nRe-pricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets re-price faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings. Moreover, if\nassets and liabilities re-price at the same time, they may not be by the same increment. For instance, if the Federal Funds Rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points; whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.\nFinancial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates. This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes to net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates. Therefore, the Company\u2019s management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts the Company\u2019s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Interest rate risk is more fully described under the section captioned \"Interest Rate Risk\" in Item 1, Business, and under the section captioned \"Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk\" in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur accounting policies and estimates are critical to how we report our financial condition and results cf operations, and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results cf operations.\nAccounting policies and estimates are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management makes judgments and assumptions in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates so that such policies and estimates comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, these policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. For example, because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates, management cannot provide any assurance that the Bank will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements. See the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nFurther, from time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and our regulators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia and the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers across West Virginia and Virginia. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Moreover, approximately 19.5% of the securities in our municipal securities portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia. A significant decline in general economic conditions in State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, whether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changes in oil prices, changes in securities markets, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax and other laws and regulations.\nThe U.S. Congress and the Administration have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code. Possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate tax rate, limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify either the one-time impacts from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon tax reform enactment or the ongoing impacts reform proposals might have on income tax expense.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets where we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets.\n\u2022\nThe ability to expand our market position.\n\u2022\nThe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands.\n\u2022\nThe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors.\n\u2022\nCustomer satisfaction with our level of service.\n\u2022\nIndustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.\nWe, primarily through the Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and\nsupervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor further detail, see the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFailure to meet any of the various capital adequacy guidelines which we are subject to could adversely affect our operations and could compromise the status of the Company as a financial holding company.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the U.S. Department of Treasury. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and could compromise the status of the Company as a banking holding company. See the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements\u201d in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for detailed capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models which may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate.\nThe processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 21, 2011. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on demand deposits to compete for customers. We do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer as market interest rates begin to increase. Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nThe value of the securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets.\nDue to credit and liquidity risks and economic volatility, making the determination of the value of a securities portfolio is less certain. There can be no assurance that decline in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other-than-temporary or permanent impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $18.5 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a financial holding company, and its sources of funds are limited.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to shareholders of the Company is derived primarily from dividends paid by the Bank. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from its subsidiary is restricted. Under federal law, the payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements. The Federal Reserve Board and/or the FDIC prohibit a dividend payment by the Company or the Bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. See the sections captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends\u201d in Item 1, Business, and Note 14, \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe inability of the Bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to the Company, or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to the Company even if earned, would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nIn addition, since the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation, reorganization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, which will generally take priority over the Bank\u2019s shareholders.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company.\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to our business.\n\u2022\nPotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the value of the target company.\n\u2022\nPotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nLiquidity refers to the ability of the Company to ensure sufficient levels of cash to fund operations, such as meeting deposit withdrawals, funding loan commitments, paying expenses and meeting quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by the Company in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities. The source of the funds for the Company\u2019s debt obligations is dependent on the Bank. If needed, the Bank has the ability to borrow term and overnight funds from the FHLB or other financial intermediaries.\nWhile management is satisfied that the Company\u2019s liquidity is sufficient at December 31, 2016 to meet known and potential obligations, any significant restriction or disruption of the Company\u2019s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nLimited availability of borrowings and liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank system and other sources could negatively impact earnings.\nThe Bank is currently a member bank of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Membership in this system of quasi-governmental, regional home-loan oriented agency banks allows us to participate in various programs offered by the FHLB. We borrow funds from the FHLB, which are secured by a blanket lien on certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, and if applicable, investment securities with collateral values in excess of the outstanding balances. Current and future earnings shortfalls and minimum capital requirements of the FHLB may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to their member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by member banks. Should this occur, our short-term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. If we were restricted from using FHLB advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we may be forced to find alternative funding sources. If we are required to rely more heavily on higher cost funding sources, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover these costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them. Many of our branches are located in rural areas and small towns where the competition for labor can be fierce, and where the pool of qualified employees may be small. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nInterruption to our information systems or breaches in security could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company relies on information systems and communications for operating and monitoring all major aspects of business, as well as internal management functions. Any failure, interruption, intrusion or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the customer relationship, management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Company has policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption,\nintrusion or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that the above-noted issues will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nThere have been several cyber-attacks on websites of large financial services companies. Even if not directed at the Company specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nCyber-attacks on third party retailers or other business establishments that widely accept debit card or check payments could compromise sensitive Bank customer information, such as debit card and account numbers. Such an attack could result in significant costs to the Bank, such as costs to reimburse customers, reissue debit cards and open new customer accounts.\nIn addition, there have been efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems change frequently (and generally increase in sophistication), often attacks are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures.\nThe occurrence of any such failure, disruption or security breach of our information systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to our customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. These risks could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors who may not perform in a satisfactory manner.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, and our vendors are not the sole source of service, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the our business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated With Our Common Stock\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. Moreover, the over-the-counter market is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the over-the-counter market is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall more than would otherwise be expected. Conversely, significant purchases of our common stock, or the absence of willing sellers, could cause our stock price to be greater than would otherwise be expected in a liquid trading market. Such pricing may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations.\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts.\n\u2022\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us.\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry.\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors.\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors.\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors.\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions.\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations.\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economies we serve; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole opportunity for gains on your investment for the foreseeable future.\nWe make no assurances that we will pay any dividends in the future. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of our consideration of whether to pay cash dividends, we intend to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of our business. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by federal policies and regulations and by the terms of our existing indebtedness. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. For further information, see the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends\" in Item 1, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have concluded that at December 31, 2016 that we have no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting we cannot assure you that we will not have a material weakness in the future. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a control deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If we fail to maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting that meets the requirements of Section 404, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Additionally, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may not have access to the capital markets, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock that could result in dilution of an investor\u2019s investment.\nOur Board of Directors may determine from time to time that there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock. These issuances would likely dilute the ownership interests of our investors and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of additional shares of common stock under our stock option and equity incentive plans will further dilute each investor\u2019s ownership of our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nCertain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17151, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MVBF"}
