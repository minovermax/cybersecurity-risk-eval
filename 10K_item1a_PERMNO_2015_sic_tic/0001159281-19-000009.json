Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Investors and prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the value of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks, the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe may fail to continue as a going concern.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management has concluded that certain conditions and events that we face raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern depends upon many factors, including our ability to increase our revenues, reduce our costs and/or pursue other transactions, including seeking to reduce our operating leverage and sell assets, to be able to continue to fund our operating and capital requirements and meet our debt obligations. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. If we pursue asset sales, we may be unable to sell at prices as high as we may be able to receive if we were not experiencing our current operating and liquidity challenges. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain any such needed additional funds by any of the foregoing or other means, and any such funds we may obtain may not be sufficient. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently operate 260 senior living communities under lease and management arrangements with SNH, or approximately 91.5% of the total communities we operate. In order to address the operating and liquidity issues we are currently experiencing, our Independent Directors and SNH\u2019s independent trustees are currently evaluating our lease and management arrangements with SNH. As a result, there may be agreed changes to our arrangements with SNH in the future. In addition, we are also currently evaluating options to refinance our existing credit facility, which is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019. We cannot be sure that any changes to our arrangements with SNH will be agreed to or occur. If we are not able to reach agreement to change our arrangements with SNH, we will likely default on our rent obligations owed to SNH unless we obtain relief. For example, we expect to obtain a temporary deferral from SNH on our obligation to pay rent to SNH under our leases with SNH for the month of February 2019 but we cannot be sure that SNH will grant us this deferral; if we do not receive this deferral or any other relief we may need in the future, we may default in paying some or all of the rent due to SNH. In addition, we cannot be sure that we will obtain any renewed or restructured credit facility, and our ability to do so will likely depend on the lenders\u2019 belief that our prospects, operating leverage and expected future operating results will permit us to continue as a going concern and to fund our operations, capital investments and debt service and other obligations. Any changes to our lease or management arrangements with SNH or renewed or restructured credit facility may not result in our realizing improved operating results or liquidity and may not be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.\nWe may default on our lease obligations.\nWe lease 184 senior living communities from SNH. As of December 31, 2018, our total annual rent payable to SNH was $207.8 million. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as part of our attempt to address the operating and liquidity issues we are currently experiencing, our Independent Directors and SNH\u2019s independent trustees are currently evaluating our lease and management arrangements with SNH. If we are not able to reach agreement to change our arrangements with SNH, we will likely default on our rent obligations owed to SNH. For example, we expect to obtain a temporary deferral from SNH for our obligation to pay rent to SNH under our leases with SNH for the month February 2019 but we cannot be sure that SNH will grant us this deferral; if we do not receive this deferral or any other relief we may need in the future, we may default in paying some or all of the rent due to SNH. If we default our leases with SNH and do not obtain relief for that default, we would likely experience a material adverse effect and we may fail to continue as a going concern.\nWe may fail to renew or replace our existing credit facility.\nOur credit facility is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019. As of March 5, 2019, we had $51.5 million of borrowings outstanding under that facility. We are currently evaluating options to refinance our credit facility. We cannot be sure that we will obtain any renewed or restructured credit facility, and our ability to do so will likely depend on the lenders\u2019 belief that our prospects, operating leverage and expected future operating results will permit us to continue as a going concern and to fund our operations, capital investments and debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to renew or restructure our credit facility, and any renewed or restructured credit facility that we may obtain may not result in our realizing improved operating results or liquidity and may not be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to fund our operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations and any reductions we make to our operating and capital expenses may harm our business.\nOur principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations are cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash balances, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from our sales to SNH of qualified capital improvements we may make to communities that we lease from SNH for increased rent pursuant to our leases. At December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $292.6 million, we have incurred operating losses in each of the last three years, and we had net negative cash flows from operations of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Further, our existing credit facility is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019 and we cannot be sure that we will renew or replace that facility. Due to our current operating and liquidity challenges, we may not be able to fund our operating and capital expenses or debt service obligations. In addition, we may reduce our capital and operating expenses, which may harm our competitive position, require us to make larger expenditures in the future for deferred maintenance and other costs and harm our business.\nWe may fail to comply with the terms of the credit agreement, including repaying the principal at maturity on June\n28, 2019.\nOur credit agreement includes various conditions, covenants and events of default. We may not be able to satisfy all of these conditions or may default on some of these covenants for various reasons, including for reasons beyond our control. For example, our credit agreement requires us to maintain certain debt service ratios. Our ability to comply with such covenants will depend upon our ability to operate our business profitably. If the recent trends in occupancy, rates and employment and other costs and expenses continue or increase or we do not sufficiently reduce our operating leverage, we may incur additional operating losses. Complying with these covenants may limit our ability to take actions that may be beneficial to us and our securityholders.\nIf we default under our credit agreement, our lenders may demand immediate payment. Any default under our credit agreement that results in acceleration of our obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness would likely have serious adverse consequences to us, including the possible foreclosure of the real estate mortgages on 10 senior living communities owned by our guarantor subsidiaries, and would likely cause the value of our securities to decline.\nIn the future, we may obtain additional debt financing, and the covenants and conditions which apply to any such\nadditional debt may be more restrictive than the covenants and conditions that are contained in our credit agreement.\nWe have realized losses from operations for the past several years and, prior to that, we had not been consistently profitable, and we have limited resources and substantial lease obligations.\nWe have realized losses from operations for the past several years and, prior to that, we had not been consistently profitable since we became a public company in 2001. We currently have limited resources and substantial lease obligations. Given our history of losses and the current industry conditions, we cannot be sure that we will be able to achieve and/or maintain profitability in the future or that we will be able to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to effectively manage our operations and cash flows, or achieve profitability in other ways, the value of our securities may be adversely affected.\nA small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe have high operating leverage. As a result, a small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results because some of our fixed costs, such as our base rent, would not decrease during times of lower revenues and could not be reduced to offset other expenses which may be increasing.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors or their families to pay for our services could cause our occupancy rates, revenues and results of operations to decline.\nAs further discussed below, government benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are not generally available for services at independent and assisted living communities. Many seniors are not otherwise able to pay our monthly resident fees with private resources. Our residents paid approximately 76.7% of our senior living revenues from operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 from their private resources, and we expect to continue to rely on the ability of our residents to pay for our services from their own financial resources. Economic downturns, softness in the U.S. housing market, higher levels of unemployment among resident family members, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility and/or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees. If we are unable to retain and/or attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings, our occupancy rates, revenues and results of operations could decline.\nThe current trend for seniors to delay moving to senior living communities until they require greater care or to forgo moving to senior living communities altogether could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeniors have been increasingly delaying moving to senior living communities, including to our senior living communities, until they require greater care, and increasingly forgoing moving to senior living communities altogether. Further, rehabilitation services and other services are increasingly being provided to seniors on an outpatient basis or in seniors\u2019 personal residences in response to market demand and government regulation, which may increase the trend for seniors to delay moving to senior living communities. Such delays may cause decreases in our occupancy rates and increases in our resident turnover rates. Moreover, older adults may have greater care needs and require higher acuity services, which may increase our cost of doing business, expose us to additional liability or result in lost business and shorter stays at our senior living communities if we are not able to provide the requisite care services or fail to adequately provide those services. These trends may negatively impact our occupancy rates, revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nIncreases in our labor costs may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWages and employee benefits associated with our operations were approximately 42% of our 2018 total operating expenses. The U.S. labor market has been experiencing an extended period of low unemployment. Further, there has been recent legislation enacted and proposed legislation to increase the minimum wage in certain jurisdictions. This, in turn, has put upward pressure on wages. We compete with other senior living community operators, among others, to attract and retain qualified personnel responsible for the day to day operations of our senior living communities. The market for qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive, and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals may require us to increase the wages and benefits we offer to our employees in order to attract and retain such personnel or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years and, as noted above, we cannot predict the future impact of the ACA, the repeal or replacement of the ACA or any other future healthcare legislation, on the cost of employee health insurance. Moreover, the low level of unemployment in the United States currently may result in our being unable to fully staff our senior living communities and clinics or having to pay overtime to adequately staff our senior living communities and clinics. Although we determine our employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing employee health\ninsurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves for labor related insurance may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe have been experiencing increases in labor costs. We cannot be sure that our labor costs will not continue to increase or that any increases will be recovered by corresponding increases in the rates we charge to our residents or otherwise. Any significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to our residents may reduce our occupancy and growth.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our senior living communities at rates that will generate acceptable returns or that we will be able to attract employees and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels which will allow us to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nIn recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed and continue to be developed. Although there are indications that the rate of newly started developments has recently declined, the increased supply of senior living communities that has resulted from recent development activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in certain geographic markets where we operate senior living communities, and we expect these competitive challenges to continue at least through 2019. These competitive challenges may prevent us from maintaining or improving occupancy and rates at our senior living communities, which may adversely affect their profitability and, therefore, negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and results from operations.\nThe failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to match our costs will reduce our income or create losses.\nSome of our current operations, especially our SNFs, receive significant revenues from Medicare and Medicaid. We derived approximately 23.3% and 22.9% of our senior living revenues from continuing operations from these programs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Payments under Medicare and Medicaid are set by government policy, laws and regulations. The rates and amounts of these payments are subject to periodic adjustment. Current and projected federal budget deficits, federal spending priorities and challenging state fiscal conditions have resulted in numerous recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare and Medicaid payments, insurance and healthcare delivery. Examples of these, and other information regarding such matters and developments, are provided under the caption \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Reimbursement\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of these matters. However, these matters could result in the failure of Medicare or Medicaid payment rates to cover our costs of providing required services to residents, or in reductions in payments to us or other circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivate third party payers continue to try to reduce healthcare costs.\nPrivate third party payers such as insurance companies continue their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These third party payers increasingly demand discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. These efforts to limit the amount of payments we receive for healthcare services could adversely affect us. Reimbursement payments under third party payer programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients participating in such programs. Future changes in, or renegotiations of, the reimbursement rates or methods of third party payers, or the implementation of other measures to reduce payments for our services could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private pay residents may be limited.\nProvisions of the ACA and efforts to repeal, replace or modify the ACA could reduce our income and increase our costs.\nThe ACA contains insurance changes, payment changes and healthcare delivery systems changes that have affected, and will continue to affect, subject to possible future repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA. The ACA provides for multiple reductions to the annual market updates for inflation that may result in reductions in SNF Medicare payment rates. In\naddition, certain provisions of the ACA that affect employers generally, including the employer shared responsibility provisions that went into effect on January 1, 2015, may have an impact on the design and cost of the health coverage that we offer to our employees. We are unable to predict the impact of the ACA on our future financial results of operations, but it may be adverse and material. In addition, maintaining compliance with the ACA will require us to expend management time and financial resources.\nThe ACA includes other changes that may affect us, such as enforcement reforms and Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives, new compliance, ethics and public disclosure requirements, initiatives to encourage the development of home and community based long term care services rather than institutional services under Medicaid, value based purchasing plans and a Medicare post acute care pilot program to develop and evaluate making a bundled payment for services, including physician and SNF services, provided during an episode of care. We are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance, payment, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our increasing costs, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.\nDepressed U.S. housing market conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of seniors to relocate to our senior living communities.\nDownturns or stagnation in the U.S. housing market could adversely affect the ability, or perceived ability, of seniors to afford our entrance fees and resident fees, as prospective residents frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of such fees. If seniors have a difficult time selling their homes, their ability to relocate to our senior living communities or finance their stays at our senior living communities with private resources could be adversely affected. If U.S. housing market conditions reduce seniors\u2019 willingness or ability to relocate to our senior living communities, the occupancy rates, revenues and cash flows at our senior living communities and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFederal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, the Family and Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other employment related matters. Because labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits. We are currently subject to employment related claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. Our failure to comply with federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, which requires us to incur significant costs and may result in losses.\nLicensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness clinics to comply with extensive standards governing operations and physical environments. Federal and state laws also prohibit fraud and abuse by senior living providers and rehabilitation and wellness clinic operators, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims and regulate patient referrals in Medicare, Medicaid and other payer programs. In recent years, federal and state governments have devoted increased resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare generally. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. When federal or state agencies identify violations of anti-fraud, false claims, anti-kickback and physician referral laws, they may impose or seek civil or criminal penalties, treble damages and other government sanctions, and may revoke a community\u2019s license or make conditional or exclude the community from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers, and for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations. In addition, when these agencies determine that there has been quality of care deficiencies or improper billing, they may impose or seek various remedies or sanctions, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary penalties, restitution of overpayments, government oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties.\nCurrent state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in closure of the facility and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Certain states and the federal government may determine that citations relating to one community affect other communities operated by the same entity or related entities, which may negatively impact an operator\u2019s ability to maintain or renew other licenses or Medicare or Medicaid certifications or to secure new licenses or certifications. In addition, revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our leases, our management agreements with SNH and our credit facility, or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future.\nOur communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a result of the healthcare industry\u2019s extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance, billing procedures and compliance with referral laws and other laws that apply to us, and we expect these costs may continue to increase. For example, as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of our compliance program initiative to review records related to our Medicare billing practices, in September 2017, we made a disclosure to the OIG regarding potential inadequate documentation and other potential issues at one of our leased SNFs. We submitted supplemental disclosures related to this matter to the OIG in December 2017 and March 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had accrued an estimated revenue reserve of $0.8 million for historical Medicare payments we received and expect to repay as a result of these deficiencies. In addition, we have recorded expenses for additional costs we incurred or expect to incur, including estimated OIG imposed penalties, as a result of this matter, totaling $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which $0.6 million remains accrued and not paid at December 31, 2018. The compliance review we undertook, which resulted in this OIG voluntary disclosure, was not initiated in response to any specific complaint or allegation, but a review of the type that we periodically undertake to test our own compliance with applicable Medicare billing rules pursuant to our compliance program.\nThe revenues we receive from Medicare and Medicaid may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set offs, administrative rulings and policy interpretations, and payment delays. If we become subject to additional regulatory sanctions or repayment obligations at any of our existing communities (or at any of our newly acquired communities with prior deficiencies that we are unable to correct or resolve), our business may be adversely affected, and we might experience financial losses. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or any penalties, repayments, or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable federal and state laws, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings.\nWe have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits and regulatory and government audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. For example, we were defendants in a lawsuit filed by the estate of a former resident of a senior living community operated by us in which a verdict was rendered against us awarding damages of approximately $19.2 million, which consisted of $2.5 million for pain and suffering and the remainder in punitive damages. In March 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement we entered with the plaintiff, approximately $7.3 million was paid to the plaintiff by us and our former liability insurer. The defense and resolution of such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may require us to incur significant expenses.\nIn several well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other senior living companies. Some lawyers and law firms specialize in bringing litigation against senior living community operators. As a result of this litigation and potential litigation, the cost of our liability insurance continues to increase. Medical liability insurance reform has at times been a topic of political debate, and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards. However, such reforms have not generally been adopted, and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase. Further, although we determine our self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing liability insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are currently defendants in two employee litigation matters and may be subject to future employee litigation. For more information regarding the two pending employee litigation matters, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation may subject us to adverse rulings and judgments that may materially impact our business, operating results and liquidity. In addition, defending litigation distracts the attention of our management and may be expensive. For more\ninformation regarding certain of our legal contingencies and past legal and compliance matters, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, payments through pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs may be reduced, and the overall attractiveness of our senior living communities to potential residents could decrease as more quality data becomes publicly available.\nCMS is moving towards pay-for-performance programs, such as value-based payment, as an alternative to fee-for-service reimbursement. In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Quality Payment Program. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. Under PAMA, beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs\u2019 performance scores on a hospital readmissions measure as part of CMS\u2019s new SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. Moreover, under the IMPACT Act, SNFs are required to report certain quality measures, resource use measures and certain patient assessment data in a standardized and interoperable format. SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates. Beginning in October 2018, HHS made SNF-reported data publicly available on its Nursing Home Compare website. We cannot predict the impact of these quality-driven payment reforms, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of more quality data becoming publicly available, but if we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease.\nIncreasing interest rates may adversely affect us.\nSince the most recent U.S. recession, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, or the U.S. Federal Reserve, has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. Recently, there have been some modest signs of inflationary price movements, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has been raising the federal funds rate since December 2016. Previously, the U.S. Federal Reserve had indicated that it expected to raise the federal funds rate further in 2019, although it recently indicated that it may delay making those increases. Market interest rates may continue to increase, and those increases may materially and negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact the housing market and reduce demand for our services and occupancy at our senior living communities, could increase our rent expense at our leased senior living communities due to the landlord setting rent based on a required return on its investment, and could reduce the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees at our managed senior living communities due to the owner requiring a minimum return on its investment prior to our being eligible to receive an incentive fee or subject our management agreements to termination by the owner of our senior living communities if it does not realize its return on invested capital under our management agreements.\n\u2022\nAmounts outstanding under our credit facility require interest to be paid at variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, our interest costs will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our ability to fund our operations and working capital.\n\u2022\nAn increase in interest rates could decrease the amount buyers may be willing to pay for our senior living communities, thereby reducing the market value of our senior living communities and limiting our ability to sell senior living communities. Further, increased interest rates would increase our costs for, and may limit our ability to obtain, mortgage financing secured by our senior living communities.\nOur growth strategy may not succeed.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business by entering into additional long term operating arrangements for senior living communities and growing the healthcare services we provide where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Our business plans include seeking to take advantage of expected long term increases in demand for senior living communities and healthcare services. Our growth strategy is subject to risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be an attractive business partner given our operating history and the liquidity challenges we are currently experiencing;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and operate additional senior living communities and clinics on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to access the capital required to operate additional senior living communities and clinics;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and operate additional senior living communities and clinics where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues;\n\u2022\nwe may not achieve the operating results we expect from newly managed or leased senior living communities or any healthcare services we may provide;\n\u2022\nthe operations of newly managed or leased senior living communities and clinics and provision of other healthcare services may subject us to unanticipated contingent liabilities or regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve newly managed or leased senior living communities, including capital expenditures that were unanticipated at the time of entry into the management or lease arrangements;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty hiring and retaining key employees and other personnel at newly managed or leased senior living communities and clinics;\n\u2022\nto the extent we incur additional lease obligations associated with new leased senior living communities or clinics, our operating leverage and resulting risks of debt defaults may increase;\n\u2022\nthe occupancy at newly managed or leased senior living communities may decline and it may take a period of time to stabilize the operations of newly managed or leased senior living communities;\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations of newly managed or leased senior living communities, clinics or other health services we may provide may disrupt our existing operations, or may cost more than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to realize any expected operating or cost efficiencies from senior living communities or clinics we agree to manage or lease;\n\u2022\nwe may agree to manage or lease senior living communities subject to unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, such as liability for the cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination or for claims by residents, vendors or other persons related to actions taken by former owners or operators of the communities;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with licensing requirements at our senior living communities, clinics or elsewhere may prevent our obtaining or renewing licenses needed to conduct and grow our businesses; and\n\u2022\nnewly managed or leased senior living communities, clinics and other new or expanded healthcare services we may seek to provide might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our other business activities.\nFor these reasons, among others, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of our additional long term operating arrangements, and our growth strategy may not succeed or may cause us to experience losses.\nOur business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our senior living communities.\nOur senior living communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to residents. Physical characteristics of senior living communities are mandated by various government authorities; changes in these regulations may require us to make significant expenditures. In addition, we are often required to make significant capital expenditures when we lease or manage new senior living communities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. SNH has historically provided most of the capital required to improve the senior living communities we lease from them or manage for their account but SNH is not required to fund capital expenditures at our senior living communities. However, when SNH funds capital expenditures at our leased senior living communities, our rent increases, and when SNH funds capital expenditures at our managed senior living communities, the invested capital upon which SNH\u2019s returns are based increases. We may be unable to pay increased rent at our leased senior living communities without experiencing losses and increases in SNH\u2019s invested capital at our managed communities may\nreduce or prevent our receipt of incentive fees or subject the applicable management agreements to termination by SNH if it is unable to realize its return on invested capital under such agreements. Further, in light of our current operating and liquidity challenges, we may be limited in making capital expenditures, which may harm our competitive position, require us to make larger expenditures in the future for deferred maintenance and other costs and harm our business.\nCurrent government policies regarding interest rates and trade as well as any prolonged government shutdown may cause a recession.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding the timing and amount of future increases in interest rates, changing U.S. and other countries\u2019 trade policies and a prolonged U.S. government shutdown may hinder the growth of the U.S. economy. It is unclear whether the U.S. economy will be able to withstand these challenges and continue sustained growth. Economic weakness in the U.S. economy generally or a new U.S. recession would likely adversely affect our financial condition, including by limiting our ability to pay rent and causing the values of our owned and operated senior living communities and of our securities to decline. Further, general economic conditions, such as inflation, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, interest rates, and tax rates, affect our operating and general and administrative expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors. Such economic uncertainties and conditions may adversely affect us and others, including our landlords, the owner of our managed senior living communities and our residents and prospective residents, such as by reducing access to funding or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting the ability to manage interest rate risk and increasing the risk that obligations will not be fulfilled, as well as other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.\nWe rely on information technology and systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology or those systems could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet, commercially available software and our internally developed applications, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes (including managing our building systems), including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personally identifiable information of employees, residents and tenants and lease data. If we experience material security or other failures, inadequacies or interruptions of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses and our operations could be disrupted as a result. Further, third party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as our internally developed applications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing and safeguarding confidential resident, tenant, customer and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others, including our residents, and information regarding their and our financial accounts. We take various actions, and incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The cybersecurity risks to us and our third party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and increasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetrate illegal or fraudulent activities against us, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities in our or third parties\u2019 information technology networks and systems or operations. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to us or our operations, or to safeguard our business processes, assets and information could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nWe may fail to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and protected health information. Under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as updated by the Omnibus Rule, we are required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rule, security standards and standards for electronic healthcare transactions. State laws also govern protected health information, and rules regarding state privacy rights may be more stringent than HIPAA. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personally identifiable information. If we fail to comply\nwith applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have steadily increased, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into many HIPAA settlements with providers.\nOperating leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from continuing as a going concern.\nWe have substantial lease and other obligations. Our total annual minimum rent payable by us under our leases was $210.6 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, our total consolidated long term debt as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $7.5 million. We also had approximately $51.5 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and $0.3 million of short term mortgage debt as of December 31, 2018.\nOur substantial lease and other obligations, including our indebtedness, could impact our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern may continue to be a substantial risk;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy our lease and debt obligations could be affected;\n\u2022\nthe funds required to make rent, interest and principal payments will not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business and industry or the economy generally.\nWe may incur significant costs from our self insurance arrangements.\nWe partially self insure up to certain limits for workers\u2019 compensation, professional and general liability and automobile coverage. Claims in excess of these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self insured. We fully self insure all health related claims for our covered employees. We may incur significant costs for claims and related matters under our self insurance arrangements. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher retention amounts, self insurance or other means in the future. Although we determine our employee health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and professional and general liability self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Determining reserves for the casualty, liability, workers\u2019 compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events, including projected settlements for pending claims, known incidents that we expect may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments, estimated litigation costs and other factors. Since these reserves are based on estimates, the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved and could result in our recognizing a significant amount of expenses in excess of our reserves. Our costs under our self insurance arrangements may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nSuccessful union organization of our employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time labor unions attempt to organize our employees. If federal legislation modifies the labor laws to make it easier for employee groups to unionize, additional groups of employees may seek union representation. If our employees were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nTermination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living communities typically require a written resident agreement with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate these assisted living resident agreements for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, most of our resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements on 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we may be unable to contract with assisted living residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with terms of up to a year or longer. If a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents may result in high resident turnover rates.\nChanges in tax laws or other actions could have a negative effect on us.\nAt any time, the federal or state income tax laws, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us.\nIn particular, December 2017 legislation made substantial changes to the IRC, especially as it relates to the taxation of corporate income. Among those changes are a significant permanent reduction in the generally applicable corporate income tax rate, changes in the taxation of individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers that generally reduce their taxes on a temporary basis subject to \u201csunset\u201d provisions, and the elimination or modification of various deductions. The new provisions generally limit business interest expense deductions to 30% of a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted taxable income for a taxable year, and beginning after 2021, this limitation will become more stringent as it will be determined after application of any deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. Additionally, the legislation also imposes additional limitations on the usage of net operating losses. Many of the provisions of the new law will require guidance through the issuance of Treasury regulations in order to assess their effect. There may be a substantial delay before such regulations are promulgated, increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us. It is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the new law, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us.\nWe may be unable to use our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards before they expire, or our ability to use our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nNet operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards are subject to limitations in accordance with federal and state regulations, such as limitations imposed under Section 382 of the IRC following an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in applicable Treasury regulations) and a limitation stemming from the December 2017 amendments to the IRC providing that carryforwards of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017 generally cannot offset more than 80% of the current year\u2019s taxable income. Moreover, pursuant to the December 2017 amendments to the IRC, net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017 may not be carried back, but may be carried forward indefinitely.\nIn addition, if we experience an ownership change, our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which currently are expected to be utilized to offset future taxable income, may be subject to limitations on usage or elimination. Our bylaws contain certain provisions to facilitate the preservation of the tax treatment of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, including provisions generally prohibiting a person or group from becoming a \u201c5-percent shareholder\u201d (as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations) without the consent of our Board of Directors. In November 2016, with the consent of our Board of Directors, ABP Acquisition LLC and certain related parties acquired approximately 36% of our common shares. Although this acquisition did not limit our ability to use our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, it limits the extent to which potential future acquisitions of our common shares by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d may be made without limiting our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforwards, which are scheduled to begin expiring in 2026 if unused, were approximately $167.0 million, and our federal tax credit carryforwards, which begin expiring in 2022 if unused, were approximately $18.9 million. If in the future we use our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards to reduce our tax liabilities, the existence and amounts of these net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards may be subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities and the amounts of these net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards may be reduced.\nOur operations are subject to environmental risks and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur in connection with hazardous substances. Under our leases with SNH, we have agreed to indemnify SNH for any environmental liabilities it incurs related to the properties on which our senior living communities that we lease from SNH are located. The costs and damages that may arise from environmental hazards are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including uncertainty about the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, the location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it may take to remediate contamination. In addition, these laws also impose various requirements regarding the operation and maintenance of properties and record keeping and reporting requirements relating to environmental matters that require us to incur costs to comply with.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and costs for environmental matters.\nOur operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events.\nSevere weather may have an adverse effect on certain senior living communities we operate. Flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes and widespread fires have had and may have in the future an adverse effect on senior living communities we operate and result in significant losses to us and interruption of our business. When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather or climate-related event and in terms of potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.\nFurther, concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long term, we believe any such increased operating costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. However, in the short term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of our securities to decline.\nOur former rehabilitation hospitals may be subject to retroactive Medicare reclassifications or repayments.\nDuring the period we operated our rehabilitation hospitals, which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013, Medicare payments accounted for a significant amount of the rehabilitation hospitals\u2019 revenues. CMS has established a standard known as the \u201c60% Rule\u201d, which provides that at least 60% of an inpatient rehabilitation facility\u2019s, or IRF\u2019s, total inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of thirteen designated medical conditions in order for the facility to be classified as an IRF by the Medicare program. Although we believe that our IRFs were operated in compliance with the 60% Rule during the period in which we operated them, CMS could determine that we were non-compliant in a prior year. Such an event would result in these rehabilitation hospitals being subject to Medicare reclassification to a different type of provider and our receiving lower Medicare payment rates retroactively. Also, retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by IRFs and other providers are expanding, and CMS is recouping amounts paid for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare criteria for coverage as billed. If our IRFs were required to make substantial retroactive repayments to Medicare, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be sure that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all\ncontrol objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could result in misstatements of our results of operations or our financial statements or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nChanges in lease accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted new accounting rules that are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 2018, which require companies to capitalize long term leases on their balance sheets by recognizing lessees\u2019 rights and obligations. Since January 1, 2019, we are now required to account for the leases for our senior living communities, including those with SNH, in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, where previously we accounted for such leases on an \u201coff balance sheet\u201d basis. As a result, a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities are recorded on our balance sheet and we may be required to make other changes to the recording and classification of our lease related expenses. Though these changes do not have any direct impact on our overall financial condition, these changes could cause investors or others to believe that we are highly leveraged and could change the calculations of financial metrics and covenants, as well as third party financial models regarding our financial condition.\nRISKS ARISING FROM CERTAIN OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nOur agreements and relationships with SNH, one of our Managing Directors, RMR LLC and others related to them may create conflicts of interest or the perception of such conflicts of interest.\nWe have significant commercial and other relationships with SNH, one of our Managing Directors, Adam D. Portnoy, RMR LLC and others related to them, including:\n\u2022\nThe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by SNH and our business is substantially dependent upon our relationship with SNH;\n\u2022\nSNH owned 8.3% of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2018;\n\u2022\nRMR LLC, a subsidiary of RMR Inc., provides management services to us and SNH and we pay RMR LLC fees for those services based on a percentage of revenues, as defined under our business management agreement with RMR LLC. In the event of a conflict between us and SNH or us and RMR LLC, any of its affiliates or any public entity RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services to, RMR LLC may act on its own and SNH\u2019s or such other entity\u2019s behalf rather than on our behalf;\n\u2022\nOne of our Managing Directors, Adam Portnoy, is also a managing director, an officer and employee and, as the sole trustee of ABP Trust, the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., and is an officer of, and through ABP Trust owns equity interests in, RMR LLC. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC;\n\u2022\nOne of our Managing Directors, Adam Portnoy, is our largest stockholder and beneficially owned, in aggregate, approximately 35.7% of our outstanding common shares and 1.1% of SNH's outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2018;\n\u2022\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer, Katherine E. Potter, and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Richard A. Doyle, are also officers and employees of RMR LLC, as are SNH\u2019s president and chief operating officer and chief financial officer and treasurer;\n\u2022\nPrior to December 31, 2001, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of SNH. On that date, SNH distributed substantially all of our then outstanding common shares it owned to its shareholders. In connection with that distribution, we entered agreements with SNH and RMR LLC which, among other things, limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that could jeopardize the tax status of SNH as a real estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by SNH or other businesses managed by RMR LLC;\n\u2022\nWe lease our office headquarters building from a subsidiary of ABP Trust;\n\u2022\nWe, SNH, ABP Trust and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services currently own AIC, are parties to a shareholders agreement regarding AIC and participate in AIC\u2019s property insurance program.\nThese multiple responsibilities, relationships and cross ownerships could create competition for the time and efforts of RMR LLC, Adam Portnoy and other RMR LLC personnel, including our executive officers, and give rise to conflicts of interest, or the perception of such conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, RMR Inc., RMR LLC, our Managing Directors, the other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and their related parties. Conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares and other securities and we may be subject to increased risk of litigation as a result.\nAs a result of these relationships, our leases and management and pooling agreements with SNH, business management agreement with RMR LLC and other transactions with SNH, our Managing Director, RMR LLC and others related to them were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis between unrelated third parties, and therefore the terms thereof may not be as favorable to us as they would have been if they were negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis between unrelated third parties. In the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder litigation, dissident stockholder director nominations and dissident stockholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. These activities, if instituted against us, and the existence of conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares.\nThe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by SNH and our business is substantially dependent on our relationship with SNH.\nOf the 284 senior living communities we operate, 260 are owned by SNH. We lease 184 of these properties pursuant to five long term leases with SNH and we manage 76 of these senior living communities pursuant to long term management agreements and pooling agreements with SNH. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $983 million, or 90%, of our senior living revenue and all of our management fee revenue and reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of managed communities revenue were recognized in respect of SNH owned properties that we operate.\nSNH may terminate our leases, management agreements and pooling agreements in certain circumstances, including if SNH does not receive certain annual minimum returns on the subject properties or for our uncured material breach. Our business is substantially dependent upon our continued relationship with SNH. The loss of our leases, management agreements or pooling agreements with SNH, or a material change to their terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also \u201c-Risk Factors-We may default our lease obligations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdam Portnoy, the sole trustee of ABP Trust, beneficially owns, in aggregate, 35.7% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, investors in our securities may have less influence over our business than shareholders of other publicly owned companies.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Adam Portnoy beneficially owns, in aggregate, 35.7% of our outstanding common shares.\nFor so long as Adam Portnoy and the entities he controls continue to retain a significant ownership stake in us, he may have significant influence in the election of the members of our Board of Directors, including our Independent Directors, and the outcome of stockholder actions. As a result, they may have the ability to significantly impact all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthrough our Board of Directors, determinations with respect to our management, business and investments generally, including with respect to our acquisition and disposition of assets, financing activities and plans, capital structure, distributions on our common shares, corporate policies and the appointment and removal of our officers, among others;\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to mergers and other business combinations; and\n\u2022\nthe number of common shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the significant ownership of Adam Portnoy, the entities controlled by him and SNH in us may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price.\nAs a result of the large ownership positions of Adam Portnoy and SNH, trading in our common shares may be more difficult.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Adam Portnoy beneficially owned, in aggregate, 35.7% of our outstanding common shares and SNH owned 8.3% of our outstanding common shares. These large shareholdings, some of which are subject to lock-up restrictions, reduce the number of our common shares that might otherwise be available to trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOwnership limitations and certain provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter and bylaws contain separate provisions which prohibit any stockholder from owning more than 9.8% and 5% of the number or value of any class or series of our outstanding shares of stock. The 9.8% ownership limitation in our charter is consistent with our contractual obligation with SNH to not take actions that may conflict with SNH\u2019s status as a real estate investment trust under the IRC. The 5% ownership limitation in our bylaws, or our NOL bylaw, is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of our net operating losses and other tax benefits. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. These provisions inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nIn October 2016, our Board of Directors granted a conditional exception from certain ownership limitations under our organizational documents that allowed ABP Acquisition LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ABP Trust, to acquire 17,999,999 common shares in November 2016. Based on our Board of Directors\u2019 desire to continue to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating losses and other tax benefits, the acquisition by ABP Acquisition LLC will reduce the size of any future acquisition that our Board of Directors may be prepared to approve for purposes of our NOL bylaw.\nOther provisions contained in our charter and bylaws or under Maryland law may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u2022\nthe division of our Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change of control of us;\n\u2022\nstockholder voting rights and standards for the election of Directors and other provisions which require larger majorities for approval of actions which are not approved by our Board of Directors than for actions which are approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequired qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d, as defined in our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ncertain procedural and informational requirements applicable to stockholders requesting that a special meeting be called;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove our Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to create and issue new classes or series of stock (including stock with voting rights and other rights and privileges that may deter a change in control) and issue additional common shares;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on business combinations between us and an interested stockholder that have not first been approved by our Board of Directors (including a majority of Directors not related to the interested stockholder); and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to implement certain takeover defenses.\nIn addition, our shareholders agreement with respect to AIC provides that AIC and the other shareholders of AIC may have rights to acquire our interests in AIC in the event that anyone acquires more than 9.8% of our shares or we experience some other change in control. The terms of our leases and management agreements with SNH provide that our rights under these agreements may be cancelled by SNH upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8% of our voting stock, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents including, in certain of the leases and management agreements, the adoption of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of Directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our Directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. In addition, a change in control event of us, including upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 35% of our voting stock, is a default under our credit agreement, unless approved by our lenders.\nOur ownership interest in AIC may prevent stockholders from accumulating a large stake in us, from nominating or serving as our Directors, or from taking actions to otherwise control our business.\nAs an owner of AIC, we are licensed and approved as an insurance holding company, and any stockholder who owns or controls 10% or more of our securities or anyone who wishes to solicit proxies for election of, or to serve as, one of our Directors or for another proposal of business not approved by our Board of Directors may be required to receive pre-clearance from the concerned insurance regulators. These pre-approval procedures may discourage or prevent investors from purchasing our securities, from nominating persons to serve as our Directors or from taking other actions.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our Directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u2022\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u2022\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by such Director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur charter and contractual obligations authorize and may require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any present or former Director or officer for actions taken by them in those and other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former Directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter and contracts or that might exist with other companies, which could limit our stockholders recourse in the event of actions not in their best interest.\nStockholder litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees may be referred to mandatory arbitration proceedings, which follow different procedures than in-court litigation and may be more restrictive to stockholders asserting claims than in-court litigation.\nOur stockholders agree, by virtue of becoming stockholders, that they are bound by our governing documents, including the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. Our bylaws provide that certain actions by one or more of our stockholders against us or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, other than disputes, or any portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws, will be referred to mandatory, binding and final arbitration proceedings if we, or any other party to such dispute, including any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, unilaterally so demands. As a result, we and our stockholders would not be able to pursue litigation in state or federal court against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including, for example, claims alleging violations of federal securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties or similar director or officer duties under Maryland law, if we or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other parties or employees, against whom the claim is made unilaterally demands the matter be resolved by arbitration. Instead, our stockholders would be required to pursue such claims through binding and final arbitration.\nOur bylaws provide that such arbitration proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by our bylaws. These procedures may provide materially more limited rights to our stockholders than litigation in a federal or state court. For example, arbitration in accordance with these procedures does not include the opportunity for a jury trial, document discovery is limited, arbitration hearings generally are not open to the public, there are no witness depositions in advance of arbitration hearings and arbitrators may have different qualifications or experiences than judges. In addition, although our bylaws\u2019 arbitration provisions contemplate that arbitration may be brought in a representative capacity or on behalf of a class of our stockholders, the rules governing such representation or class arbitration may be different from, and less favorable to, stockholders than the rules governing representative or class action litigation in courts. Our bylaws also generally provide that each party to such an arbitration is required to bear their own costs in the arbitration, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and that the arbitrators may not render an award that includes shifting of such costs or, in a derivative or class proceeding, award any portion of our award to any stockholder or such stockholder\u2019s attorneys. The arbitration provisions of our bylaws may discourage our stockholders from bringing, and attorneys from agreeing to represent our stockholders wishing to bring, litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees. Our agreements with RMR LLC and SNH have similar arbitration provisions to those in our bylaws.\nWe believe that the arbitration provisions in our bylaws are enforceable under both state and federal law, including with respect to federal securities laws claims. We are a Maryland corporation and Maryland courts have upheld the enforceability of arbitration bylaws. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld agreements to arbitrate other federal statutory claims, including those that implicate important federal policies. However, some academics, legal practitioners and others are of the view that charter or bylaw provisions mandating arbitration are not enforceable with respect to federal securities laws claims. It is possible that the arbitration provisions of our bylaws may ultimately be determined to be unenforceable.\nBy agreeing to the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance by us with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a stockholder, either on his, her or its own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf of any series or class of our shares of stock or by stockholders against us or any of our Directors, officers, agents, employees, or our manager including any disputes, claims or controversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of the charter or bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, agent, employee, or manager of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws currently also provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for any dispute, or portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not apply to any action for which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland does not have jurisdiction or to a dispute that has been referred to binding arbitration in accordance with our bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland for claims that arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The arbitration and exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, agents, employees, or our manager, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our Directors, officers, agents, employees or our manager.\nWe may experience losses from our business dealings with AIC.\nWe, SNH, ABP Trust and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services each own 14.3% of AIC, and we have invested $6.0 million in AIC. We and those other AIC shareholders participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and insured or reinsured in part by AIC and we periodically consider the possibilities for\nexpanding our relationship with AIC to other types of insurance. Our principal reason for investing in AIC and for purchasing insurance in these programs is to seek to improve our financial results by obtaining improved insurance coverage at lower costs than may be otherwise available to us or by participating in any profits which we may realize as an owner of AIC. While we believe we have in the past benefitted from these arrangements, these beneficial financial results may not occur in the future, and we may need to invest additional capital in order to continue to pursue these results. AIC\u2019s business involves the risks typical of an insurance business, including the risk that it may not operate profitably. Accordingly, financial benefits from our business dealings with AIC may not be achieved in the future, and we may experience losses from these dealings.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nIf we become insolvent or fail to continue as a going concern, our securities may become worthless.\nAs noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have incurred operating losses in each of our past three fiscal years, we had an accumulated deficit of $292.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and we had net negative cash flows from operations of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we have determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we become insolvent or fail to continue as a going concern, our securities may become worthless.\nAny future equity issuances we may make may significantly dilute our stockholders\u2019 equity interests.\nThe trading price of our common shares is currently well below the historical trading prices for our common shares. If we issue additional common shares at or near current trading price levels, our pre-existing stockholders, especially our long term stockholders, may experience significant dilution of their equity interests. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are considering possible alternatives to improve our current operating and financial condition, including possible options to reduce operating leverage. To the extent we issue additional common shares as part of a transaction or other arrangement in an attempt to improve our current operating and financial condition, our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests may be significantly diluted.\nWe are not currently in compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing standard of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq. If our common shares continue to trade below $1.00 per share for a sustained period, or we fail to meet other Nasdaq continued listing standards, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common shares, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common shares and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nOn October 22, 2018, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq informing us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common shares had closed below $1.00 per common share, which is the minimum required closing bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a 180 calendar day grace period, or until April 22, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing standard. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common shares must meet or exceed $1.00 per common share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. If we are not in compliance by April 22, 2019, we may be afforded a second 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify for this additional grace period, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted period(s), including any extensions that we may receive, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common shares will be subject to delisting.\nWe are monitoring the bid price of our common shares and are considering options available to us to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing standard; however, we cannot be sure that we will be able to regain and/or maintain compliance with this listing standard or that we will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing standards. If we fail to regain and/or maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or to meet other applicable continued listing standards of Nasdaq in the future, and Nasdaq determines to delist our common shares, the market price and liquidity of our common shares could be negatively impacted and our ability to raise additional capital could be reduced.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nAs with other publicly traded securities, the value of our securities depends on various market conditions and other factors that are subject to change from time to time, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest in our securities;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the stock markets, generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nmarket interest rates;\n\u2022\nnational economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the value of our securities to decline. Stockholders may be unable to resell our common shares at or above the price at which they purchased our common shares.", "PERMNO": 89252, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "FVE"}
