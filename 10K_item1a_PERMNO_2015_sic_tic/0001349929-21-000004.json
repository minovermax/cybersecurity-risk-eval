{"cik": "1349929", "company": "CANCER GENETICS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in the Company's common stock involves a high degree of risk including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this report and the other Company reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For instance, if our pending merger with StemoniX occurs, there are risks associated with the StemoniX business described in our prospectus/proxy statement included in our Form S-4/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2021. The risks set forth below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect the Company's business, operations and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually materialize, the Company's business, financial condition and/or operations could suffer. In such event, the value of the Company's common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of the money that you pay for the Company's common stock.\nRisks Related to the StemoniX Merger and the Post-Merger Company\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our merger with StemoniX\nWhile we anticipate certain benefits from our pending merger with StemoniX, if consummated, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits. We may not be able to integrate the two businesses successfully, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. The StemoniX intellectual property may not have the scientific value and commercial potential which we envision. Any failure of the acquisition to meet our expectations could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.\nThe total number of shares of CGI Common Stock that StemoniX securityholders will be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in the aggregate, is not fully adjustable based on the market price of CGI common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe Merger Agreement has set the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the StemoniX Common Stock, which governs most but not all of the consideration to be paid by CGI in the merger, and the Exchange Ratio is only adjustable upward or downward based on (i) increases or decreases in the number of shares of StemoniX\u2019s issued and outstanding capital stock and the number of shares of StemoniX capital stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of other StemoniX securities, (ii) increases or decreases in the number of shares of CGI\u2019s issued and outstanding capital stock and the number of shares of CGI capital stock issuable on a net exercise basis under in-the-money CGI warrants and in-the-money CGI options (in each case excluding securities issued in the CGI PIPE (as defined below) and (iii) if the net cash of either CGI or StemoniX changes in relation to each other. Any changes in the market price of CGI common stock before the closing of the merger will have limited effect on the total number of shares of CGI common stock that most historical StemoniX security holders will be entitled to receive (or will be entitled to receive upon the exercise of options to purchase CGI common stock issued in exchange for StemoniX options). Therefore, if before the closing of the merger the market price of CGI common stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then such StemoniX shareholders could receive merger consideration with substantially more value.\nThe amount of CGI Common Stock to be issued to the Series C Investors upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock in the merger is based on the market price per share of CGI Common Stock at the closing of the Merger, subject to a valuation cap.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of StemoniX Series C Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) will be converted in the merger into the right to receive a number of shares of CGI common stock (the \u201cSeries C Conversion Shares\u201d) equal to the price per share paid for the Series C Preferred Stock divided by a conversion price (the \u201cSeries C Conversion Price\u201d) equal to 85% of the weighted average share price of CGI common stock over the five trading days prior to the closing of the merger, which conversion price is subject to a valuation cap (the \u201cSeries C Valuation Cap\u201d) based on a $85,000,000 valuation of CGI, after giving effect to the issuance of all shares of CGI common stock at or prior to the closing of the merger (excluding the Series C Conversion Shares and out-of-the-money options and warrants to purchase shares of CGI Common Stock, but including in-the-money options and warrants to purchase shares of CGI common stock on a net exercise basis). Therefore, if before the closing of the merger the market price of CGI common stock declines, then the Series C investors could receive more shares of CGI common stock at closing for no additional consideration, resulting in additional dilution to the other equity holders of the post-merger company. Alternatively, if the market price of CGI common stock increases to a level representing a valuation at or above the Series C Valuation Cap, the Series C Conversion Price will only increase up to a price based on the Series C Valuation Cap, and the other stockholders of CGI will suffer dilution. As of February 1, 2021, the Series C Valuation Cap would be reached if CGI\u2019s stock prices resulted in a 5 day value weighted average price of CGI\u2019s common stock of $4.39 or\nmore. There is expected to be an aggregate of $2 million of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger.\nThe post-merger company may need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt or through licensing arrangements, which may cause dilution to the post-merger company\u2019s stockholders or restrict the post-merger company\u2019s operations or proprietary rights. CGI and StemoniX have recurring losses from operations which in the past have raised substantial doubt regarding their respective abilities to continue as a going concern.\nAlthough management of CGI and StemoniX believe that, assuming the merger and the transactions related thereto are consummated, the post-merger company\u2019s cash reserves and cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund operations for at least the 12 months from the closing of the merger, such estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Accordingly, the post-merger company may be required to raise funds sooner than currently planned.\nThe post-merger company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon (among other things) the availability and terms of future funding. Additional financing may not be available to the post-merger company when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the post-merger company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, such an issuance may cause significant dilution to the post-merger company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the post-merger company\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing the post-merger company enters into may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the post-merger company\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments. In addition, if the post-merger company raises additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the post-merger company.\nFailure to complete the merger may result in CGI or StemoniX paying an expense reimbursement to the other party and could harm the common stock price of CGI and future business and operations of each company.\nIf the merger is not completed, CGI and StemoniX are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and certain events occur, CGI or StemoniX will be required to pay the other party an amount equal to all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by such other party in connection with the preparation and negotiation of the Merger Agreement, due diligence efforts by the party or otherwise in connection with the merger; provided, however, that the amount payable may be up to and will in no event exceed $500,000;\n\u2022the price of CGI stock may decline; and\n\u2022costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and investment banking fees must be paid even if the merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the CGI or StemoniX board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that CGI or StemoniX will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by each party in the merger.\nIf the conditions to the merger are not met, the merger may not occur.\nThere are a number of conditions to the merger, including but not limited to approval by Nasdaq for listing of the shares, and certain other conditions. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur or will be delayed, and CGI may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.\nCGI is the target, and may in the future be the target, of securities class action and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the completion of the merger.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements in an effort to enjoin the relevant merger or seek monetary relief. CGI is currently the defendant in eight lawsuits, and CGI may in the future be defendants in one or more lawsuits, relating to the Merger Agreement and the merger and, even if the pending or any future lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert\nmanagement time and resources. CGI cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or others, nor can it predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve such litigation. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation surrounding the merger could delay or prevent its consummation. In addition, the costs of defending the litigation, even if resolved in CGI\u2019s favor, could be substantial and such litigation could distract CGI from pursuing the consummation of the merger and other potentially beneficial business opportunities.\nNo fairness opinion was obtained in connection with the merger.\nWhile CGI engaged H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (\u201cWainwright\u201d) as its exclusive financial advisor with respect to considering strategic alternatives including finding a merger partner, neither Wainwright nor any other independent investment banker or other professional was requested to provide a fairness opinion in connection with the merger. The consideration to be received by the holders of StemoniX securities in the merger was reached through negotiation by CGI and Wainwright, on one hand, and StemoniX and Northland Securities (\u201cNorthland\u201d), its investment banker, on the other, and was found to be fair to the stockholders of CGI by CGI\u2019s board of directors. In determining whether to obtain a fairness opinion in connection with consideration of the merger, CGI\u2019s board considered the cost of such an opinion as well as, among other factors, the search process leading to the Business Disposals (as defined elsewhere herein), the extensive search process conducted by CGI and Wainwright thereafter seeking a merger partner or other strategic alternative for CGI, the absence of any offers to purchase vivoPharm for other than a nominal sum, the extensive negotiations with StemoniX by CGI and Wainwright, the board\u2019s assessment of the prospects for StemoniX based on its evaluation of its medical and scientific intellectual property and the valuation of StemoniX implicit in its prior financings, when compared to and in light of CGI\u2019s current market value and its financial position.\nThe merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the merger, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either CGI or StemoniX can refuse to complete the merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party prior to closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on CGI or StemoniX, including:\n\u2022any adverse effect that results from general economic, business, financial or market conditions (unless such adverse effect affects CGI or StemoniX in a disproportionate manner as compared to their respective industry peers);\n\u2022any adverse effect that results from conditions in any of the industries or industry sectors in which CGI or StemoniX operates (unless such adverse effect affects CGI or StemoniX in a disproportionate manner as compared to their respective industry peers);\n\u2022any adverse effect resulting from any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak (including COVID-19), act of terrorism, war, national or international calamity or any other similar event (unless such adverse effect affects CGI or StemoniX in a disproportionate manner as compared to their respective industry peers);\n\u2022the taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement; or\n\u2022with respect to CGI, any change in the stock price or trading volume of CGI Common Stock.\nIf adverse changes occur and CGI and StemoniX still complete the merger, the post-merger company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the merger to the stockholders of CGI.\nThe market price of the post-merger company\u2019s common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of the post-merger company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the merger for a number of reasons including if:\n\u2022investors react negatively to the prospects of the post-merger company\u2019s business and prospects from the merger;\n\u2022the effect of the merger on the post-merger company\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022the post-merger company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nCGI stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger.\nIf the post-merger company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, CGI securityholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in CGI without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the post-merger company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nThe lack of a public market for StemoniX shares makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of the StemoniX shares, and StemoniX shareholders may receive consideration in the merger that is less than the fair market value of the StemoniX shares and/or CGI may pay more than the fair market value of the StemoniX shares.\nStemoniX is privately held and its capital stock is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine StemoniX\u2019s fair market value. Because the percentage of CGI equity to be issued to StemoniX stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the CGI Common Stock to be received by StemoniX shareholders will be less than the fair market value of StemoniX, or CGI may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for StemoniX.\nThe pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on the trading price of CGI Common Stock and CGI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nWhile there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the pendency of the merger could disrupt CGI\u2019s businesses in the following ways, including:\n\u2022the attention of CGI\u2019s management may be directed toward the closing of the merger and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations; and\n\u2022third parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with CGI as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with CGI or otherwise.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of CGI Common Stock or harm CGI\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThe Company has a history of net losses; the Company expects to incur net losses in the future, and the Company may never achieve sustained profitability.\nThe Company has historically incurred substantial net losses. The Company incurred losses of $8.0 million and $6.7 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. From the Company\u2019s inception in April 1999 through December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $172 million. The Company expects losses to continue. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the Company\u2019s revenue growth and costs associated with being a public company, the Company is unable to predict when the Company will become profitable, and the Company may never become profitable. Even if the Company does achieve profitability, the Company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company\u2019s inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrior to the closing of the CGI PIPE and CGI RD Financing, the Company\u2019s recurring losses from operations raised substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company believes that its cash at December 31, 2020, together with net proceeds of (i) $8.9 million from the issuance and sale of CGI securities in the CGI PIPE (ii) $15.8 million from the issuance and sale of CGI securities in the CGI RD Financing (as defined below), and (iii) $4.0 million from three warrant exercises between February 10, 2021 and March 23, 2021, will be sufficient to fund normal operations for the 24 months from the date of this filing.\nNevertheless, the Company can provide no assurance that, given its history of losses, it will continue as a going concern, including after the merger.\nThe Company\u2019s sources of funds are uncertain.\nThe Company earns revenue and generates cashflow from its Discovery Business through its vivoPharm subsidiary. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $8.0 million, cash used in continuing operations of $4.9 million and revenues from the Discovery Services business unit of $5.8 million in the period. For the year period ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $6.9 million, had cash used in continuing operations of $3.2 million and revenues from the Discovery Services business unit of $7.3 million in the period. No assurances can be given as to whether the Company will ever be profitable.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are more limited than prior to the sale of its Clinical Services business and the sale of its BioPharma Services business, and thus the costs of maintaining itself as a publicly traded corporation are proportionally higher as a percentage of total revenue and will be more burdensome to the Company going forward.\nAs a public company, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies requires considerable time and attention of management. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules of the SEC and national securities exchanges have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Management and other personnel are devoting and will continue to need to devote a substantial amount of time and money to these compliance obligations. The board may view these costs to be disproportionately expensive when viewed in light of the Company\u2019s reduced revenues and overall operations following the Business Disposals.\nAs a result of the above, the board of directors elected to pursue the merger transaction with StemoniX and may elect to pursue other strategic transactions, to attempt to expand the business and create additional value for shareholders, or in light of the time, costs and uncertainties inherent in seeking such a strategic transaction, and the costs in remaining as a public company, the Company\u2019s board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. If the Company\u2019s board of directors were to approve and recommend, and the Company\u2019s stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, the Company would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Company\u2019s commitments and contingent liabilities may include severance obligations related to the recent asset sales. As a result of this requirement, a portion of the Company\u2019s assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company.\nThe Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company is not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of its financial reporting, investor confidence in the Company and the value of its common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, the Company is required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), requires that the Company evaluate and determine the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nDuring the audit for the 2020 fiscal year, the Company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the Company's accounting for the potential impairment of intangible assets. This accounting requires the Company to record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and is in excess of the fair value of the asset group. The Company's calculation of undiscounted future cashflows resulted in a conclusion that no impairment was necessary, however, the Company could not supply supporting evidence that its calculation was accurate.\nManagement is committed to remediating the material weakness. The Company began the process of implementing changes to its internal control over intangible assets to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness, including\nfurther improvements in processes and analyses that support the recording of possible impairment of intangible assets. The Company expects this deficiency to be corrected by May 15, 2021.\nIf the Company's steps are insufficient to successfully remediate the material weaknesses and otherwise establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of its financial reporting, investor confidence in the Company and the value of its common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. For as long as the Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the U.S. securities laws, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require the Company to incur the expense of remediation.\nMoreover, the Company does not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of its control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact the Company.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business and Strategy\nIf the Company is unable to increase sales, the Company revenues will be insufficient to achieve profitability.\nThe Company currently derives substantially all revenues from testing services, laboratory services and CRO at the premarket stage. Discovery Services are services that include proprietary preclinical test systems supporting clinical diagnostic and prognostic offerings at early stages, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and academic research centers. In particular, the Company\u2019s preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, response to immuno-oncology directed novel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcome is supported by the Company\u2019s extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems. It is unclear whether the Company will be able to maintain and grow the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations who will avail themselves of the Company\u2019s services.\nIf the Company is unable to increase sales of tests and services, the Company will not produce sufficient revenues to become profitable.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent global outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that the Company or its employees, contractors, suppliers, courier delivery services and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 has had and may have on the Company\u2019s business, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain of material needed for the Company\u2019s Discovery Services and could delay future projects from commencing due to COVID-19 related impacts on the demand for Company services and therefore have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s corporate and accounting functions are located in New Jersey and were previously subject to a stay-at-home order, and are currently subject to social distancing orders and guidelines. The Company\u2019s preclinical laboratories located in the United States were subject to a stay-at-home order until June 2020, and are now subject to social distancing\norders, and its Australia laboratories remain subject to stay-at-home orders. Many of the Company\u2019s customers worldwide are similarly impacted. As a healthcare provider, the Company has been allowed to remain open in compliance with the shelter-in-place and stay-at-home mandates and continue to provide critical services in the development of new therapies and the fight against cancer and other diseases. The Company is still providing Discovery Services, and began to experience a slowdown in project work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second and third quarters of 2020 and expects the future of many projects may be delayed. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may impact business, results of operations and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nAlso, it may hamper the Company\u2019s efforts to provide its investors with timely information and comply with its filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIf pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations decide not to use the Company\u2019s preclinical CRO services in connection with their clinical trials, the Company may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain the Company\u2019s business.\nTo generate demand for its Discovery Services, the Company needs to educate pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations on the utility of the Company\u2019s tests and services to improve the outcomes of clinical trials for new oncology drugs and more rapidly advance targeted therapies through the clinical development process through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions by members of the Company\u2019s sales force. The Company may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical and other personnel to support this process. If the Company cannot convince pharmaceutical and biotech companies or clinical research organizations to order its diagnostic tests or other future tests the Company develops, the Company will likely be unable to create demand for tests in sufficient volume for it to achieve sustained profitability.\nThe potential loss or delay of the Company\u2019s large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect results.\nMost of the Company\u2019s Discovery Services customers can terminate the contracts upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. These customers may delay, terminate or reduce the scope of the contracts for a variety of reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022decisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial;\n\u2022lack of available financing, budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u2022unexpected or undesired clinical results for products; or\n\u2022shift of business to a competitor or internal resources.\nAs a result, contract terminations, delays and alterations are a possible outcome in the Company\u2019s Discovery Services business. In the event of termination, the contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, but these fees may not be sufficient for the Company to maintain margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates. In addition, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the backlog of contractually committed services if customers cancel, delay or reduce their commitments under the Company\u2019s contracts with them, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke the Company\u2019s status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect Company revenues and profitability. The Company believes the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where the Company is party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nThe timing, size and duration of the Company\u2019s contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations depend on the size, pace and duration of such customer\u2019s clinical trial, over which the Company has no control and sometimes limited visibility. In addition, expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A\nshortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in the Company\u2019s net income. As a result, quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nIf the market for the Company\u2019s services does not experience significant growth or if services do not achieve broad acceptance, operations will suffer.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the size of the market for the Company\u2019s services. The expansion of this market depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022the cost, performance and reliability of the Company\u2019s services, and the services offered by competitors;\n\u2022customers\u2019 perceptions regarding the benefits of the Company\u2019s services;\n\u2022customers\u2019 satisfaction with the Company\u2019s services; and\n\u2022marketing efforts and publicity regarding the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may be adversely affected if it underprices contracts, overruns cost estimates or fails to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders.\nMost of the Discovery Services contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixed-fee contracts. The Company\u2019s past financial results have been, and future financial results may be, adversely impacted if the Company initially underprices contracts or otherwise overrun cost estimates and is unable to successfully negotiate a change order. Change orders can occur when the scope of work the Company performs needs to be modified from that originally contemplated by the contract with the customer and are typically treated as new projects. Modifications can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. Where the Company is not successful in converting out-of-scope work into change orders under current contracts, the Company bears the cost of the additional work. Such underpricing, significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf the Company fails to perform the services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, the Company could be subject to significant costs or liability and the Company\u2019s reputation could be harmed.\nIn connection with the Discovery Services business, the Company contracts with biopharmaceutical companies to provide specialized services to assist them in planning and conducting unique, specialized studies to guide drug discovery and development programs with a concentration in oncology and immuno-oncology. The Company\u2019s services include managing pre-clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, electronic data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If the Company fails to perform the services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against the Company for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials. Customers may also bring claims against the Company for breach of contractual obligations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nSuch consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:\nImproper performance of the Company\u2019s services. The performance of clinical development services is complex and time-consuming. For example, the Company may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, the Company could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on the ability to perform services. As examples:\n\u2022non-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022compromise of data from a particular clinical trial, such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients, could require the Company to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of the contract at no further cost to the customer, but at a substantial cost to the Company; and\n\u2022breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nWhile the Company endeavors to contractually limit exposure to such risks, improper performance of the Company\u2019s services could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, damage reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nAny investigation of our customers could damage our business.\nFrom time to time, one or more of the Company\u2019s customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs. There is a risk that either the Company\u2019s customers or regulatory authorities could claim that the Company performed services improperly or that the Company is responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If the Company\u2019s customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against the Company and prove them, the Company could be subject to damages, fines or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of customers\u2019 clinical trials, programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm the Company\u2019s development efforts and increase costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and ongoing or planned research and development activities of customers. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which the Company or Company customers operate. The Company cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if the Company or any of its customers, suppliers, regulators and other third parties with whom the Company conducts business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, the ability to conduct business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the healthcare-related facilities in which Company customers conduct studies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operation and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to manage growth in business, prospects may be limited and the Company\u2019s future results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company intends to continue with sales and marketing programs and other activities as needed to meet future demand. Any significant expansion may strain managerial, financial and other resources. If the Company is unable to manage such growth, business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company will need to improve continually the operations, financial and other internal systems to manage growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and diminished operational results.\nThe Company may acquire other businesses or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm operating results, dilute its stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase debt or cause the Company to incur significant expense.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s business strategy, the Company may pursue other mergers or acquisitions of businesses and assets. For example, the Company has an acquisition of StemoniX pending, and it acquired vivoPharm in 2017, Response Genetics, Inc. in 2015 and Gentris Corporation in 2014, and entered into a joint venture in May 2013 with Mayo Foundation for Education and Research. The Company subsequently shut down Response Genetics operations in California and moved them to New Jersey and North Carolina and in February 2020 completed the commitments thereby ending the need for the Company\u2019s joint venture with Mayo. The Company also sold the Clinical Business and BioPharma Business in two transactions in July 2019 (the \u201cBusiness Disposals\u201d). The Company has developed experience with acquiring other companies and forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. The Company may not be able to find suitable partners or merger or acquisition candidates, and may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If the Company makes any acquisitions, the Company may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into existing business, and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing existing business. The Company may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on the results of operations. The Company may not\nidentify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any mergers or acquisitions, the Company may choose to issue shares of common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of its stockholders. If the price of the Company\u2019s common stock is low or volatile, the Company may not be able to acquire other companies using stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for the Company to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company, or at all.\nThere is a scarcity of experienced professionals in the Company\u2019s industry. If the Company is not able to retain and recruit personnel with the requisite technical skills, the Company may be unable to successfully execute the business strategy.\nThe specialized nature of the Company\u2019s industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. The Company\u2019s future success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business, regulatory and administrative personnel) necessary to support anticipated growth, develop business and perform certain contractual obligations. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that the Company requires and the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, the Company may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel required to continue and grow operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or the Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain skilled employees could result in the inability to continue to grow the Company\u2019s business or to implement business strategy.\nThe loss or transition of any member of the Company\u2019s senior management team or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians, and salespeople could adversely affect Company business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of the senior management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as the Company continues to develop tests and services, and as the Company expands commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of the senior management team could adversely affect operations if the Company experiences difficulties in hiring qualified successors.\nThe complexity inherent in integrating a new key member of the senior management team with existing senior management may limit the effectiveness of any such successor or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to business or may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Specifically, a leadership transition in the commercial team may cause uncertainty about or a disruption to the Company\u2019s commercial organization, which may impact the ability to achieve sales and revenue targets.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract, hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales professionals would hamper the ability to increase demand for the Company\u2019s services and to expand geographically.\nThe Company\u2019s success in selling Discovery Services could require the Company to expand the sales force in the United States and internationally by recruiting additional sales representatives with extensive experience in the Company\u2019s field. To achieve the Company\u2019s marketing and sales goals, the Company will need to continue to expand sales and commercial infrastructure. Sales professionals with the necessary technical and business qualifications are in high demand, and there is a risk that the Company may be unable to attract, hire and retain the number of sales professionals with the right qualifications, scientific backgrounds and relationships with decision-makers at potential customers needed to achieve sales goals. The Company may face competition from other companies in the industry, some of whom are much larger than the Company and who can pay greater compensation and benefits than the Company can, in seeking to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing employees. If the Company is unable to hire and retain qualified sales and marketing personnel, business will suffer.\nIf the Company\u2019s laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or the Company is required to vacate any facility, the ability to provide services may be jeopardized.\nThe Company currently derives substantially all revenues from preclinical services. The Company\u2019s facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for the Company to perform tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform services or the backlog of projects that could develop if any of the Company\u2019s facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and the Company may be unable to regain those customers or repair the\nCompany\u2019s reputation in the future. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s facilities and the equipment used to perform research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nIf the Company cannot compete successfully with competitors, the Company may be unable to increase or sustain revenues or achieve and sustain profitability.\nThe Company faces competition from companies that offer or are developing animal models for tumors and that have capabilities in toxicology and pharmacology testing. The competitors in the Company\u2019s Discovery Services business include Covance, Champions Oncology, Crown BioScience (recently acquired by JSR Life Sciences), Eurofins Scientific, Charles River, Jackson Labs and Explora Biolabs.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may succeed in selling their products to pharmaceutical and biotech customers more effectively than the Company sells products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and may develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or more of the Company\u2019s competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any of those that the Company currently sells or will develop, results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nA small number of customers account for most of the sales of the Company\u2019s services. If any of these customers require fewer services from the Company for any reason, revenues could decline.\nDue to the early-stage nature of the Company\u2019s business and the limited sales and marketing activities to date, the Company has historically derived a significant portion of revenue from a limited number of customers, although the customers that generate a significant portion of Company revenue may change from period to period. The Company\u2019s customers are largely pharmaceutical and biotech companies as part of a clinical trial. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, four customers accounted for approximately 61% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue from continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three customers accounted for approximately 61% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue from continuing operations. As a healthcare provider, the Company is still providing Discovery Services and has yet to experience a slowdown in its project work; however, the future of many projects may be delayed. The Company continues to vigilantly monitor the situation with its primary focus on the health and safety of its employees and clients.\nIf the Company uses biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, the Company could be liable for damages.\nThe Company\u2019s activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and hazardous materials and chemicals. The Company cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, the Company could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed the Company\u2019s resources or any applicable insurance coverage the Company may have. Additionally, the Company is subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of an accident or if the Company otherwise fails to comply with applicable regulations, the Company could lose permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nThe Company\u2019s Discovery Services customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products, which may lower the amount that they spend on the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company\u2019s Discovery Services customers face increasing competition from lower cost generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with the Company. In the United States, EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing customers\u2019 sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization, including in the Company\u2019s services. If competition from generic products impacts customers\u2019 finances such that they decide to curtail the Company\u2019s services, revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of operations. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including test processing, sample tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing, and general and administrative activities. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of the Company\u2019s servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of the Company\u2019s operations depend could have an adverse effect on business.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected if the Company fails to realize the full value of goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe Company assesses the realizable condition of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill annually and conducts an interim evaluation whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset, indicate that these assets may be impaired. The Company\u2019s ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the businesses the Company has acquired, which in turn depend in part on how well the Company has integrated these businesses into the Company\u2019s own business. If the Company is not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized goodwill impairment of $2.9 million after considering the effects of the Business Disposals and declines in stock price. Such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, with which compliance may be costly.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could require the Company to pay for environmental remediation and response costs, or subject the Company to third party claims for personal injury, natural resource or property damage, relating to environmental contamination. Liability may be imposed whether or not the Company knew of, or were responsible for, such environmental contamination. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of compliance with environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements or of remediating contamination could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, assets or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s rights to use technologies licensed from third parties are not within the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not be able to sell products if the Company loses existing rights or cannot obtain new rights on reasonable terms.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to market certain of services, domestically and/or internationally, is in part derived from licenses to intellectual property which is owned by third parties. As such, the Company may not be able to continue selling services if the Company loses existing licensed rights or sell new services if the Company cannot obtain such licensed rights on reasonable terms. As may be expected, the Company\u2019s business may suffer if (i) these licenses terminate; (ii) if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, properly maintain the licensed intellectual property or fail to prevent infringement of such intellectual property by third parties; (iii) if the licensed patents or other intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or (iv) if the Company is unable to enter into necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. In return for the use of a third-party\u2019s technology, the Company may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of products as well as other fees. Such royalties and fees are a component of cost of product revenues and will impact the margins on the Company\u2019s tests.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain intellectual property protection, competitive position could be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to protect proprietary discoveries and technologies affects the Company\u2019s ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability. Currently, the Company relies on a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, licenses, work-for-hire agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements to protect intellectual property rights. The Company also maintains as trade secrets certain company know-how and technological innovations designed to provide the Company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Currently, including both U.S. and foreign patent applications, the Company has only two issued U.S. patents and twelve pending patent applications relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s technology. While the Company does not currently intend to pursue additional patent applications, it is possible that pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents. Even if patents are issued, third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids the Company\u2019s patents. Further, the Company cannot be certain that the steps that have been taken will prevent the misappropriation of the Company\u2019s trade secrets and other confidential information and technology, particularly in foreign countries where the Company does not have intellectual property rights.\nThe Company may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time the Company may face intellectual property infringement (or misappropriation) claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect the Company negatively. For example, were a third-party to succeed on an infringement claim against the Company, the Company may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, the Company could face an injunction, barring the Company from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require the Company to enter into a license agreement which may not be pursuant to acceptable or commercially reasonable or practical terms or which may not be available at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against the Company may require the Company to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, the Company would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require the Company to re-validate tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFurthermore, the Company may initiate claims to assert or defend intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether the Company is the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from the Company\u2019s business and negatively affect operating results or financial condition. The Company may not be able to prevent, alone or with third-party collaborators or suppliers, misappropriation of the Company\u2019s proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, interference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to patents and patent applications or those of the Company\u2019s current or future collaborators, suppliers or customers.\nFinally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the Company\u2019s confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s International Operations\nInternational expansion of the Company\u2019s business exposes the Company to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy incorporates international expansion, including recent acquisitions which have provided facilities in Australia, and the possibility of establishing and maintaining other locations outside of the United States and expanding relationships with biopharmaceutical, academic and governmental research organizations. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax and transfer pricing laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022being subject to additional privacy and cybersecurity laws, including the Australian Privacy Act of 1988;\n\u2022failure by the Company or distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of tests in various countries, including failure to achieve \u201cCE Marking\u201d, a conformity mark which is required to market in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Economic Area and which is broadly accepted in other international markets;\n\u2022difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities.\nAny of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across global operations.\nAlthough the Company reports operating results in U.S. dollars, a portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly in Australia and Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on the Company. Because the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect revenues, income from operations, other income (expense), net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, in some countries the Company could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to use these funds across its global operations.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company\u2019s policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, potential loss of export licenses, possible suspension of the ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for products and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. The Company may operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. The Company cannot assure that the internal control policies and procedures always will protect the Company from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and could remain volatile, and the market price of common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 2015 through March 18, 2021, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated from a high of $382.50 per share in the third quarter of 2015, to a low of $1.92 per share in the first quarter of 2020. In the month of February 2021, the market price of the Company\u2019s stock fluctuated from a low of $3.52 per share to a high of $17.50 per share. Market prices for securities of development-stage life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited\n\u2022progress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing the Company\u2019s proprietary tests;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain qualified regulatory and research and development personnel;\n\u2022changes in the relationship with key collaborators, suppliers, customers and third parties;\n\u2022changes in the market valuation or earnings of competitors or companies viewed as similar to the Company;\n\u2022changes in key personnel;\n\u2022depth of the trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u2022realization of any of the risks described under this section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d; and\n\u2022general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against the Company, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed actual results, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts establish and publish their own periodic projections for the Company\u2019s business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results the Company actually achieves. The Company\u2019s stock price may decline if the actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on the Company downgrades the Company\u2019s stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company\u2019s business, stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company\u2019s stock price or trading volume could decline. While the Company expects securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover the Company, the trading price for the Company\u2019s stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is incurring significant costs and devotes substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, the Company is incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, in addition to being required to comply with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company is required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Company expects that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, the Company expects that management and other personnel will continue to need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the Company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, the Company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if the Company loses status as a \u201cnon-accelerated filer,\u201d the Company will be required to have the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires the Company to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The Company currently does not have an internal audit group, and the Company will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If the Company or the independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of the Company\u2019s stock could decline and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement the Company\u2019s business plan and maintain compliance with Section 404, as applicable, requires the Company to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. The Company expects that the Company will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage the Company\u2019s business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause operations to suffer and the Company may be unable to conclude that internal control over financial reporting is effective. If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in the Company\u2019s financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for the Company\u2019s common stock, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove the current members of the board and management.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove members of the board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s common stock, thereby depressing the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022authorize the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that the board of directors does not approve;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022limit who may call a stockholder meeting.\nIn addition, the Company is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on the Company\u2019s common stock, from merging or combining with the Company for a prescribed period of time.\nBecause the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of the Company\u2019s common stock price for any return on your investment. Even if the Company changes that policy, the Company may be restricted from paying dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial performance, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 14094, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "CGIX"}
