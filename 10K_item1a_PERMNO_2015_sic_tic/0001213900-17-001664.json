{"cik": "1023994", "company": "SG BLOCKS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 2016, the Company continues to be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with residual Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nSGB emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 30, 2016. The ultimate impact this will have on SGB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. During bankruptcy, SGB operated without interruption and paid all creditors in full. However, we cannot assure you that our recent bankruptcy will not adversely affect SGB\u2019s operations going forward.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we will experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months and our ability to raise capital may be limited.\nOn December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $579,117 and $497,000 respectively. However, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $1,971,313 and $2,743,116, respectively. If we are not successful with our efforts to increase sales, we will experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If there is a shortfall, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, among other steps, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations going forward.\nWe may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to meet any cash shortfalls. The type, timing, and terms of any financing we may select will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds are available, whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. Moreover, the terms of the secured convertible debentures issued to certain investors require that we obtain the consent of such investors prior to our entering into subsequent financing arrangements.\nIf we are unable to secure additional financing, further reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders. If we incur additional debt, we will likely be subject to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and require us to encumber our assets. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures will be significantly limited. Any of the above limitations could force us to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and you could lose all of your investment in our common stock. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have issued secured convertible debentures that may restrict our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe issued two, two-year secured convertible debentures on June 30, 2016 and November 17, 2016 that are convertible into shares of our common stock to HCI. See \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d and \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Transactions with Hillair Capital Investments L.P.\u201d Under the terms of the secured debentures, we are restricted in our ability to issue additional shares of common stock as long as any portion of the principal or interest on the secured debentures remains outstanding. Specifically, we may not, without the prior consent of the holders of the secured debentures, sell or grant any option to purchase or sell any common stock (or equivalents thereof) entitling a person to acquire shares of common stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price for such debentures. We are also precluded under the terms of the secured debentures from, among other things, incurring additional indebtedness (other than permitted indebtedness) or granting any third party a security interest in our assets. Our inability, without the secured debenture holders\u2019 consent, to provide a discount on our stock or to grant a security interest could make it difficult to find parties willing to make additional investments in us or to loan us money and therefore could adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the secured convertible debentures may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the secured convertible debentures may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders because the selling stockholders may ultimately convert and sell the full amount issuable on conversion. There is no upper limit on the number of shares that may be issued, and therefore HCI may convert the entire amount of their debentures at a ratio of one share for every $3.75 of debt. This will have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock.\nIf we are required for any reason to repay our outstanding secured convertible debentures, we would be required to deplete our working capital, if available, or raise additional funds. Our failure to repay the secured convertible debentures, if required, could result in legal action against us, which could require the sale of substantially all of our assets, currently pledged under a uniform commercial code filing in the state of Delaware.\nAny event of default in our obligations to the holders of the secured convertible debentures, such as our failure to repay the principal when due, our failure to issue shares of common stock upon conversion by the holder, breach of any covenant, representation, or warranty in the securities purchase agreements for such secured convertible debentures or in the secured convertible debentures, or the commencement of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or liquidation proceeding against us, could require the early repayment of the secured convertible debentures. If we are required to repay the secured convertible debentures, we would be required to use our limited working capital and raise additional funds. If we were unable to repay the secured debentures when required, the debenture holders could commence legal action against us and foreclose on all of our assets to recover the amounts due, which could cause a severe limit on our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses in prior periods, and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenues. We may incur operating losses in the future as we execute our growth strategy. We intend to make significant expenditures related to marketing, expansion of our website, hiring of additional personnel, and development of our technology and infrastructure. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of the difficulties facing the construction industry as a whole, economic conditions, and the competitive environment in which we operate. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to sustain or increase profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon securing additional capital.\nThe Company expects that through the next 10 to 16 months, the capital requirements to fund the Company\u2019s growth and to cover the operating costs of a public company will consume substantially all of the cash flows that it expects to generate from its operations, as well as from the proceeds of intended issuances of debt and equity securities. The Company further believes that during this period, while the Company is focusing on the growth and expansion of its business, the gross profit that it expects to generate from operations will not generate sufficient funds to cover these anticipated operating costs. Accordingly, the Company requires external funding to sustain operations and to follow through on the execution of its business plan. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s plans will materialize and/or that the Company will be successful in funding estimated cash shortfalls through additional debt or equity capital and through the cash generated by the Company\u2019s operations. Given these conditions, the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon it being able to secure an adequate amount of debt or equity capital to enable it to meet its cash requirements. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrants into established markets, the competitive environment in which the Company operates and the current capital raising environment.\nThe exercise or conversion of outstanding convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders.\nAs of February 13, 2017, there are outstanding options to purchase 542,394 shares of common stock. We also have outstanding convertible debt that is initially convertible into approximately 916,667 shares of our common stock. However, the terms of the convertible debentures provide that under certain circumstances the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the debentures can be increased based on the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. Accordingly, if the price of the common stock is significantly below $3.75 per share the number of shares the convertible debt is convertible into could be significantly higher than 916,667 shares. The exercise of such options or the conversion into common stock of our convertible debt would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our stock, and any sales in the public market of common stock underlying such securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided by such securities. See \u201cExecutive Compensation-Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table-Stock Options.\u201d\nWe are dependent on the services of key personnel, and the unexpected loss of their services may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends highly upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team, specifically the efforts of Paul Galvin, our Chief Executive Officer, Mahesh Shetty, our Chief Financial Officer, Stevan Armstrong, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and David Cross, our Vice President of Business Development. The employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin and Armstrong have expired and the Company is currently negotiating a new agreement with Messrs. Galvin, Armstrong, Cross and Shetty. Although there is a general agreement on the terms of the new agreements, there can be no assurance that SGB will be able to enter into new agreements with Messrs. Galvin, Armstrong, Cross and Shetty on favorable terms. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate increased revenue will depend upon our ability to retain, and, if necessary, attract experienced management personnel.\nWe rely on certain vendors to supply us with materials and products that, if we were unable to obtain, could adversely affect our business.\nWe have relationships with key materials vendors, and we rely on suppliers for our purchases of products from them. Any inability to obtain materials or services in the volumes required and at competitive prices from our major trading partners, the loss of any major trading partner, or the discontinuation of vendor financing (if any) may seriously harm our business because we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or at all. Other factors, including reduced access to credit by our vendors resulting from economic conditions, may impair our vendors\u2019 ability to provide products in a timely manner or at competitive prices. We also rely on other vendors for critical services such as transportation, supply chain, and professional services. Any negative impacts to our business or liquidity could adversely impact our ability to establish or maintain these relationships.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe depend on the availability and skill of subcontractors, their willingness to work with us, and their selection of suitable and quality building materials.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our building projects and, in many cases, to select and obtain raw materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, improper construction processes or defective materials may be used to finish construction of our building projects. We may need to spend money to remediate such problems when they are discovered. Defective products widely used by the construction industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of buildings. Though subcontracts are written to protect us from substandard performance or materials, pervasive problems could adversely affect our business. The cost to us in complying with our warranty obligations in these cases may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, materials suppliers, and insurers. Further, the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of subcontractors. Although we believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good, there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conduct our operations. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs and on a timely basis could limit our ability to construct and deliver buildings and could erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty protecting our proprietary manufacturing processes, which could affect our ability to compete.\nThe Company uses a proprietary manufacturing process which allows us to be code-compliant in our SG BlocksTM product. Such manufacturing process is unique to the construction industry and is important to ensure SGB\u2019s continued success, and we cannot assure you that our efforts to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective. If other companies replicate our methodology, SGB could lose its competitive advantage. In addition, we currently have one patent application pending for the system and method for conversion of intermodal shipping containers to universal building modules. Any pending or future patent or trademark applications may not lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances. The Company also cannot be assured that the scope of any patents issued in the future will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. Others may develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products, or services, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated, or infringed by others. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nExpansion of our operations may strain resources, and our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results.\nIncreased orders for our product, SG BlocksTM, have placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our operational, financial, and managerial resources and personnel. In addition, execution of our growth strategy will require further substantial capital and effective planning. Significant rapid growth on top of our current operations could greatly strain our internal resources, leading to a lower quality of customer service, reporting problems, and delays, resulting in a loss of market share and other problems that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to grow could place an additional strain on our personnel, management systems, liquidity, and other resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our operations could be adversely affected, resulting in slower, no, or negative growth, critical shortages of cash, and a failure to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur liability for estimated warranties may be inadequate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the construction industry and can be costly. At this time, our third-party providers offer guarantees and warranties in accordance with industry standards that flow through to our clients. A large number of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe can be adversely affected by failures of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our associates (i.e., employees), officers, and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, there are instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business may engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. It is possible that our associates may become aware of these practices but do not take steps to prevent them. If we learn of practices relating to buildings constructed on our behalf that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we will move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible, and we will take disciplinary action with regard to our associates who were aware of the practices, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take, we may be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation may be injured.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the construction industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe construction industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many international, national and regional economic factors including the availability of consumer and wholesale financing, seasonality of demand, consumer confidence, interest rates, income levels and general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions. As a result of the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results fluctuate, and we currently expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we have and may continue to experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the construction market. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our financial condition and operating results.\nCyber security risks related to the technology used in our operations and other business processes, as well as security breaches of company, customer, employee, and vendor information, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data and interact with customers, vendors, and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions, including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the systems. Misuse of internal applications, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other corporate assets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Delayed sales, slowed production, or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales, business delays, and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Construction Sector\nOur customers may be dependent upon third-party financing, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if additional third-party financing for our customers does not become available.\nOur business and earnings depend substantially on our clients\u2019 ability to obtain financing for the development of their construction projects. The availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry, the departure of financial institutions from the industry, the financial institutions\u2019 lending practices, the strength of the domestic and international credit markets generally, governmental policies and other conditions, all of which are beyond our control. In light of the current economic climate, some of our projects may not be successful in obtaining additional funds in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for construction financing, has been greatly reduced, and lenders may require project developers to invest increased amounts of equity in a project in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Unfavorable changes in the availability and terms of financing in the industry will have a material adverse effect on certain privately financed projects.\nOur results of operations also depend on the ability of any potential privately financed customers to obtain loans for the purchase of new buildings. Over the past few years, lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards which have reduced lending volumes. If this trend continues, it would negatively impact our sales, which depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing. In addition, where our potential customers must sell their existing buildings or real estate in order to develop new buildings, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent buyers of potential customers\u2019 existing buildings from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to make purchases from us. If our potential customers cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe construction industry is highly competitive, and such competition may increase the adverse effects of industry conditions.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment characterized by competition from numerous local, regional, and national builders. We may compete for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. A decline in construction starts could adversely affect demand for our buildings and our results of operations. Increased competition could require us to further increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices, which could negatively affect our profits.\nThere can be no assurance that SG BlocksTM or modular construction techniques will achieve market acceptance and grow; thus, the future of our business and the modular construction industry as a whole is uncertain.\nThere can be no assurance that we will achieve market acceptance for our SG BlocksTM or that the modular construction market will grow. Our business may be disrupted by the introduction of new products and services and is subject to changing consumer preferences and industry trends, which may adversely affect our ability to plan for the future development and marketing of our products. Although SG BlocksTM have particular applications in a wide variety of market segments, there is no assurance that we will be able to expand our relationship within such market segments or, even if we do, that general market acceptance for SG BlocksTM will continue to increase.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our projects, increase our expenses, or limit our building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nVarious domestic and international rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the construction industry. Governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. These industries also have experienced an increase in U.S. state and local legislation and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. If governments in locations in which we operate take actions like the ones described, they could adversely affect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those areas. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed projects, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties. Failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to or affecting us, or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws affecting us, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe dangers inherent in our operations and the limits on insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability costs and materially interfere with the performance of our operations.\nWhile we believe our insurance coverage is adequate and in line with our industry\u2019s standards, all construction, including modular construction, involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and suspension of operations. The failure of such structures during and after installation can result in similar injuries and damages. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability. In addition, changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we and our competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThere has historically been a limited trading market for our common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for such stock.\nOur Former Common Stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board since 1999, but it no longer trades, as such stock no longer exists. Our New Common Stock has not been listed on any exchange and does not trade. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained after the offering of our common stock pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on February 6, 2017. The public offering price for our common stock will be determined by negotiations between the representatives of the underwriters and us. The public offering price may not correspond to the price at which our common stock will trade in the public market subsequent to such offering, and the price of our common stock available in the public market may not reflect our actual financial performance.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nAfter the offering of our common stock upon the effective date of our registration statement on Form S-1, the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, in part because our shares are not currently traded publicly. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf economic and market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the construction industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf industry developments;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf material litigation or government disputes;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors, and significant stockholders; and\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after the offering of our common stock pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on February 6, 2017. The sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, shares subject to outstanding options under our SG Blocks, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cIncentive Plan\u201d) will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nAlso, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional securities by our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and could discourage the acquisition of the Company.\nOur Board, without any action by our stockholders, is authorized to designate and issue additional classes or series of capital stock (including classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such classes or series. The issuance of any new class or series of capital stock would not only dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders but may also adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock. The rights of holders of preferred stock and other classes of common stock that may be issued may be superior to the rights of the holders of the existing class of common stock in terms of the payment of ordinary and liquidating dividends and voting rights.\nIn addition, the ability of the Board to designate and issue such undesignated shares could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer or takeover proposal regarding the Company and the issuance of additional shares having preferential rights could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock and render more difficult the removal of current management, even if such removal may be in the stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nRules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting and, for certain issuers (but not us), an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. During the course of our assessment, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. We also expect the regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified officers and members of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d or \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d), particularly to serve on the Audit Committee of our Board (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d), and make some activities more difficult, time consuming, and costly. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404, or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of remediation actions and testing or their effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy.\nIf we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an unqualified report as required by Section 404, or we are required to restate our financial statements, we may fail to meet our public reporting obligations and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the 2016 OID Debentures (defined herein) require that HCI be entitled to participate in any dividend or other distribution during the time such debentures remain outstanding, as long as HCI would be deemed to be a holder of common shares on an as-converted basis on the record date for such dividend or distribution. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or our industry, or publish negative reports about our business or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our industry, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, change their opinion of the prospects for our company in a negative manner, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Such provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of the Company, including a transaction in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our stock.", "PERMNO": 16802, "SIC": 3440, "TIC": "SGBX"}
