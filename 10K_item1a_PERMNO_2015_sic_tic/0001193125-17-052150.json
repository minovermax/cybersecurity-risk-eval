{"cik": "949870", "company": "BOSTON BEER CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks described below should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock. These are\nrisks and uncertainties that management believes are most likely to be material and therefore are most important for an investor to consider. The Company\u2019s business operations and results may also be adversely affected by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to it, or which it currently deems immaterial, or which are similar to those faced by other companies in its industry or business in general. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe Company Faces Substantial Competition.\nThe Better Beer category within the United States beer market is highly competitive, due to the increasing number of craft brewers with similar pricing and target drinkers and gains in market share achieved by domestic specialty beers and imported beers, and more recently the acquisition of craft brewers by the four largest market competitors, AB InBev, MillerCoors, Constellation and Heineken. The Company faces strong competition from these brewers as they acquire craft brewers, or introduce new domestic specialty brands to many markets and expand their efforts behind existing brands. Imported beers, such as Corona\u00ae, Heineken\u00ae and Modelo Especial\u00ae, also continue to compete aggressively in the United States beer market. The Company anticipates competition among domestic craft brewers will remain strong, as craft brewers experienced their twelfth successive year of growth in 2016 and there were many new startups. The Company estimates there are now over 6,500 craft breweries in operation or in the planning stages up from 1,409 operating craft breweries in 2006. Also, existing craft breweries are building more capacity, local tap rooms, expanding geographically, adding more SKUs and styles as Distributors and retailers are promoting and making more shelf space available for more craft beer brands. The continued growth in the sales of craft-brewed domestic beers and in imported beers is expected to increase the competition in the Better Beer category within the United States beer market and, as a result, prices and market share of the Company\u2019s products may fluctuate and possibly decline.\nThe Company\u2019s products compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. The Company competes with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by the Company\u2019s Distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, including AB InBev, MillerCoors, Heineken and Constellation Brands, have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. Moreover, the introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with the Company\u2019s products or that diminish the importance of the Company\u2019s products to retailers or Distributors may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nFurther, the beer industry has seen continued consolidation among brewers in order to take advantage of cost savings opportunities for supplies, distribution and operations. Illustrative of this consolidation is AB InBev\u2019s $107 billion purchase of SAB Miller and the related sale by SAB Miller to MolsonCoors of its 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture with MolsonCoors, as well as Heineken\u2019s acquisition of a 50% interest in Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $500 million and Constellation Brand\u2019s acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits for approximately $1 billion. Also, in the last few years, both AB Inbev and MillerCoors have purchased multiple regional craft breweries with the intention to expand the capacity and distribution of these breweries. Due to the increased leverage that these combined operations will have in distribution and sales and marketing expenses, the costs to the Company of competing could increase. . The potential also exists for these large competitors to increase their influence with their Distributors, making it difficult for smaller brewers to maintain their market presence or enter new markets. The continuing consolidation could also reduce the contract brewing capacity that is available to the Company. These potential increases in the number and availability of competing brands, the costs to compete, reductions in contract brewing capacity and decreases in distribution support and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThere Is No Assurance that the Company Can Reverse its recent Sales declines and Return to Periods of Growth or, Conversely, Adapt to the Challenges of a Lower-Growth Environment.\nIn recent periods, the Company has experienced a decline in the demand for its products. The Company\u2019s ability to reverse these trends and return to periods of growth may be limited, by its ability to increase its market share in domestic and international markets, including those markets that may be dominated by one or more regional or local craft brewers, and by the increasing number of competitors, the emergence of local tap rooms as a significant on premise channel, and drinker interest in new or local products, rather than established brands. The development of new products by the Company may lead to reduced sales of the Company\u2019s other products, including its flagship Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Reduced sales, among other factors, could lead to lower brewery utilization, lower funds available to invest in brand support and reduced profitability, and these challenges may require a different mix and level of marketing investments to stabilize and grow volumes. While the Company believes that a combination of innovation, brand messaging and investment and sales execution can lead to increased demand, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s actions will be successful in maintaining the Company\u2019s historical levels of profitability.\nTurnover in Company Leadership or Other Key Positions May Lead to Loss of Key Knowledge or Capability and Adversely Impact Company Performance.\nIn 2016 the Company made changes in several senior management positions, including hiring a new Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and senior supply chain officer to succeed retiring executives. In early 2017, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Roper, announced his plans to retire in 2018 after leading the Company for more than 17 years. The Board of Directors has created a search committee and retained Korn Ferry to assist in identifying and evaluating the best candidates to succeed Roper as CEO. The Company may well experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future. The departure of key leadership personnel, especially a long-serving chief executive officer, can take from the Company significant knowledge and experience. This loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts. Attracting, retaining, integrating and developing high performance individuals in key roles is a core component of the Company\u2019s strategy for addressing its business opportunities. Attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions, such as the declining growth environment now facing the Company. Failure to attract and retain the right talent, or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover, would affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet its challenges and may cause the Company to miss performance objectives or financial targets.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Manage Demand for Its Products.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth may also be limited by its ability to meet production goals and/or targets at the Company\u2019s owned breweries, disruption or operating performance issues at the Company\u2019s owned breweries, limits on the availability of suitable production capacity at third party-owned breweries, and the Company\u2019s ability to enter into brewing contracts with third party-owned breweries on commercially acceptable terms, and its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain ingredients and packaging materials, such as hops, malt, cider ingredients, bottles and cans, from suppliers.\nThe Company has Significantly Increased its Product Offerings and Distribution Footprint, which Increases Complexity and Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results.\nThe Company has significantly increased the number of its commercially available beers, FMBs, hard ciders and hard seltzers that it produces. Since 2010, the Company has introduced many new beers, ciders and hard seltzers under the Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard, Twisted Tea and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand names. A&S Brewing currently has four brands, including three small breweries and retail beer halls where beer is sold and consumed on-premise. In 2015, the Company began national distribution of certain styles of the Traveler Beer\nbrand and the Coney Island beer brand, including Coney Island Hard Root Beer. Also in November 2015, the Company opened the Angry Orchard Innovation Cider House at its apple orchard located in Walden, New York, where hard cider is fermented, sold and consumed on-premise. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of certain styles of the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand. These additional brands and locations, along with the increases in demand for certain existing brands, have added to the complexity of the Company\u2019s product development process, as well as its brewing, fermenting, packaging, marketing and selling processes. The Company does not have significant experience with managing this number of brands and products and has limited experience with integrating acquired brands or operating small production facilities and retail operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively manage such increased complexity, without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. Such inefficiencies or deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nUnexpected Events at Company-Owned Production Facilities, Reduced Availability of Breweries Owned by Others, Increased Complexity of the Company\u2019s Business, or the Expansion Costs of the Company-Owned Breweries Could Have A Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Operations or Financial Results.\nPrior to 2008, the Company pursued a production strategy that combined the capacity at its Cincinnati Brewery, which was acquired in 1997, with significant production arrangements at breweries owned by third parties. The brewing services arrangements with breweries owned by others allowed the Company to utilize their excess capacity, providing the Company with production flexibility, as well as cost advantages over its competitors, while maintaining full control over the brewing process for its beers. The Company purchased the Pennsylvania Brewery in June 2008. As a result of that acquisition and the subsequent expansion of the Pennsylvania Brewery\u2019s capacity, the volume of core brands brewed at Company-owned breweries increased, and currently over 95% of the Company\u2019s volume is brewed and packaged at breweries that it owns.\nIn 2016, the Company brewed its flagship beer, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, at each of its three Samuel Adams breweries, but at any particular time it may rely on only one brewery for its products other than Samuel Adams Boston Lager. The Company expects to continue to brew most all of its volume in 2017 at its Company-owned breweries. This reliance on its own breweries exposes the Company to capacity constraints and risk of disruption of supply, as these breweries are operating at or close to current capacity in peak months. Management believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its brewing locations is temporarily interrupted, although as volumes at the Pennsylvania Brewery increase, severe interruptions there would be problematic, particularly during peak season. In addition, if interruptions were to occur, the Company may not be able to maintain its current economics and could face significant delays in starting replacement brewing locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental action, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shut downs or natural or unavoidable catastrophe.\nThe growth in the Company\u2019s business and product complexity and the expansion of the capacities and manpower at the Company\u2019s breweries to facilitate greater reliance on its owned breweries heighten the management challenges that the Company faces. In recent years, the Company has had product shortages and service issues and the Company\u2019s supply chain struggled under the increased volume and experienced increased operational and freight costs as it reacted. In response to these issues, the Company has significantly increased its packaging capabilities and tank capacity and added personnel to address these challenges. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively manage such increasing complexity without experiencing future planning failures, operating inefficiencies, insufficient employee training, control deficiencies or other issues that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The prior growth of the Company, changes in operating procedures and increased complexity have required significant capital investment. The Company to date has not seen operating cost leverage from these increased volumes and there is no guarantee that it will.\nThe Company continues to avail itself of capacity at third-party breweries. During 2016, the Company brewed and/or packaged certain products under service contracts at facilities located in Latrobe, Pennsylvania and\nMemphis, Tennessee. In selecting third party breweries for brewing services arrangements, the Company carefully weighs a brewery\u2019s capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods and its quality control capabilities throughout the production process. To the extent that the Company needs to avail itself of a third-party brewing services arrangement, it exposes itself to higher than planned costs of operating under such contract arrangements than would apply at the Company-owned breweries or an unexpected decline in the brewing capacity available to it, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The use of such third party facilities also creates higher logistical costs and uncertainty in the ability to deliver product to the Company\u2019s customers efficiently and on time.\nAs the brewing industry continues to consolidate and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could brew some of its beers, if necessary, has become a more significant concern and, thus, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s brewing needs will be uniformly met. The Company continues to work at its Company-owned breweries, and with its contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. Nevertheless, should an interruption occur, the Company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and/or increased production and/or distribution costs and be required to make significant capital investments to secure alternative capacity for certain brands and packages, the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. A simultaneous interruption at several of the Company\u2019s production locations or an unexpected interruption at one of the Company-owned breweries would likely cause significant disruption, increased costs and, potentially, lost sales.\nThe Company Is Dependent on Its Distributors.\nIn the United States, where approximately 96% of its beer is sold, the Company sells most all of its alcohol beverages to independent beer Distributors for distribution to retailers and, ultimately, to drinkers. Although the Company currently has arrangements with approximately 350 Distributors, sustained growth will require it to maintain such relationships and possibly enter into agreements with additional Distributors. Changes in control or ownership within the current distribution network could lead to less support of the Company\u2019s products. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current distribution network or secure additional Distributors on terms favorable to the Company.\nContributing to distribution risk is the fact that the Company\u2019s distribution agreements are generally terminable by the Distributor on relatively short notice. While these distribution agreements contain provisions giving the Company enforcement and termination rights, some state laws prohibit the Company from exercising these contractual rights. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its existing distribution arrangements may be adversely affected by the fact that many of its Distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large percentage of their revenue and, therefore, they may be influenced by such producers. If the Company\u2019s existing distribution agreements are terminated, it may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms, which may result in an increase in the costs of distribution.\nThe Company\u2019s Freshest Beer Program Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results.\nIn late 2010, the Company started the implementation of its Freshest Beer Program with domestic Distributors to reduce both the time and temperature the Company\u2019s beers experience at Distributor warehouses before reaching the market. Historically, Distributors have carried three to five weeks of packaged inventory (usually at ambient temperatures) and three to four weeks of draft inventory. The Company\u2019s goal is to reduce this warehouse time through better on-time service, forecasting, production planning and cooperation with the Distributors. At December 31, 2016, the Company had 159 Distributors, representing approximately 77% of its volume, participating in the program at various stages of inventory reduction. The Company has successfully reduced the inventories of participating Distributors by approximately two weeks, resulting in fresher beer being delivered to retail. The Freshest Beer Program has resulted in lower shipments of approximately 270,000, 87,000, and 103,000 case equivalents in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively as measured at the end of the year by evaluating\nthe year on year inventory reduction from the inventory levels that might otherwise have been expected. In 2015 and 2016, the Company has been piloting a small group of distributors on a pure replenishment service model within our Freshest Beer Program, which if successful would further reduce Distributor inventories. The ordering process has changed significantly for Distributors that participate in the Freshest Beer Program and has resulted in a shorter period between order placement and shipment and posed much greater challenges for forecasting and production planning. Also, changes to the Distributor ordering process has increased the complexity of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition for shipments to Distributors that participate in the Freshest Beer Program.\nIt is possible that the Freshest Beer Program may not ultimately be successful; that its costs of implementation may exceed the value realized; or that the outcome of such inventory reductions may prove detrimental to the Company\u2019s business trends and ability to execute at retail. The Company may encounter unexpected problems with forecasting, accounting, production and Distributor cooperation. These issues may in the past have led and in the future could lead to shortages and out of stocks of the Company\u2019s products at the Distributor and retailer levels, result in increased costs, negatively impact Distributor relations, and/or delay the Company\u2019s implementation of this program.\nThe Company also fills orders from those of its Distributors who may independently choose to build their inventories or run their inventories down. Such a change in Distributor inventories is unpredictable and can lead to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual results.\nThe Company is Dependent on Key Suppliers, Including Foreign Sources; Its Dependence on Foreign Sources Creates Foreign Currency Exposure for the Company; The Company\u2019s Use of Natural Ingredients Creates Weather and Crop Reliability and Excess/Shortage Inventory Exposure for the Company.\nThe Company purchases a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the brewing of its products, including its malt, hops, barley and other ingredients, from a limited number of foreign and domestic suppliers. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beer from two suppliers during 2016. Nevertheless, the Company believes that there are other malt vendors available that are capable of supplying part of its needs. The Company is exposed to the quality of the barley crop each year, and significant failure of a crop would adversely affect the Company\u2019s costs.\nThe Company predominantly uses Noble hops for its Samuel Adams lagers. Noble hops are varieties from several specific growing areas recognized for superior taste and aroma properties and include Hallertau-Hallertauer, Tettnang-Tettnanger, Hersbruck-Hersbrucker and Spalt-Spalter from Germany and Saaz-Saazer from the Czech Republic. Noble hops are rare and more expensive than most other varieties of hops. Traditional English hops, namely, East Kent Goldings and English Fuggles, and/or United States hops are used in most of the Company\u2019s ales. The demand for hops grown in the United States has grown due to the success and growth of craft brewers and the popularity of beer styles that include hops grown in the United States. Certain United States hops are in tight supply and prices have risen for both spot purchases and forward contract pricing, accordingly. The Company enters into purchase commitments with several hops dealers, based on the Company\u2019s projected future volumes and brewing needs. The dealers then contract with farmers to meet the Company\u2019s needs. However, the performance and availability of the hops, as with any agricultural product, may be materially adversely affected by factors such as adverse weather or pests and there is no guarantee the contracts will be fulfilled completely. Further, the use of fertilizers and pesticides that do not conform to United States regulations, the imposition of export/import restrictions (such as increased tariffs and duties) and changes in currency exchange rates could result in increased prices or shortages of acceptable hops.\nThe Company attempts to maintain up to a two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply. The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site. Hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating out of hops or barley to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply.\nThe Company uses special varieties of apples in its ciders that it believes are important for the ciders\u2019 flavor profile. These apples are sourced primarily from European, United States and New Zealand suppliers and include bittersweet apples from France and New Zealand and culinary apples from Italy and Washington state. There is limited availability of these apples and many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating from apples to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply. In 2012, the Company experienced shortages of apples, primarily due to growth in excess of that planned, that impacted the timing of shipments of its hard ciders to Distributors. Since 2012, the Company has not experienced any shortage of apples. The Company has entered into contracts to cover its expected needs for 2017 and expects to realize full delivery against these contracts.\nExcept for the shortage of apples in 2012, the Company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers, although the Company has had to pay significantly above historical prices to secure supplies when inventory and supply have been tight. The Company\u2019s new product development can also be constrained by any limited availability of certain ingredients. Growth rates higher than planned or the introduction of new products requiring special ingredients could create demand for ingredients greater than the Company can source. Although the Company believes that there are alternative sources available for some of the ingredients and packaging materials, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost effective basis, in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders. The loss or significant reduction in the capability of a supplier to support the Company\u2019s requirements could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results, until alternative supply arrangements were secured.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts for certain hops and apples that are payable in Euros, Pounds Sterling and New Zealand dollars, and therefore, the Company is subject to the risk that the Euro, Pound or New Zealand dollar may fluctuate adversely against the U.S. dollar. The Company has, as a practice, not hedged this exposure, although this practice is regularly reviewed. Significant adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The cost of hops has increased in recent years due to the rising market price of hops and exchange rate changes. The continuation of these trends will impact the Company\u2019s product cost and potentially the Company\u2019s ability to meet the demand for its beers. The Company buys some other ingredients and capital equipment from foreign suppliers for which the Company also carries exposure to foreign exchange rate changes.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and commitments exceed management\u2019s expected future usage. The computation of the excess inventory requires management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth, product mix, cancellation costs and supply, among others. Actual results may differ materially from management\u2019s estimates. The Company continues to manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment. However, changes in management\u2019s assumptions regarding future sales growth, product mix and hops market conditions could result in future material losses.\nAn Increase in Packaging Costs Could Harm the Company\u2019s Financial Results.\nThe Company maintains competitive sources for the supply of certain packaging materials, such as shipping cases and glass. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. In 2016, cans, crowns, six pack carriers and labels were each supplied by single sources. Although the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available, the loss of any of the Company\u2019s packaging materials suppliers could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured. Additionally, there has been acquisition and consolidation activity in several of the packaging supplier networks which could potentially lead to disruption in supply and changes in economics. If packaging costs continue to increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along to drinkers through increased prices. The Company has\nentered into long-term supply agreements for certain packaging materials that have shielded it from some cost increases. These contracts have varying lengths and terms and there is no guarantee that the economics of these contracts can be replicated when renewed. The Company\u2019s inability to preserve the current economics on renewal could expose the Company to significant cost increases in future years. Some of these contracts require the Company to make commitments on minimum volume of purchases based on Company forecasts. If the Company\u2019s needs differ significantly from its forecasts, the Company would likely incur storage costs for excess production or contractual penalties that might be significant to Company financial results.\nThe Company initiates bottle deposits in some states and reuses glass bottles that are returned pursuant to certain state bottle recycling laws. The cost associated with reusing the glass varies. The Company believes that it benefits economically from cleaning and reusing these bottles, which result in a lower cost than purchasing new glass, and that it benefits the environment by the reduction in landfill usage, the reduction of usage of raw materials and the lower utility costs for reusing bottles versus producing new bottles. The economics of using recycled glass varies based on the cost of collection, sorting and handling, retailer, distributor and glass dealer behavior, the availability of equipment and service providers that will clean bottles for reuse, and may be adversely affected by changes in state regulation. There is no guarantee that the current economics of using returned glass will continue, or that the Company will continue its current used glass practices.\nAn Increase in Energy Costs Could Harm the Company\u2019s Financial Results.\nIn the last five years, the Company has experienced significant variation in direct and indirect energy costs, and energy costs could change unpredictably. Increased energy costs would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs, including increases in the cost of ingredients and supplies. The Company\u2019s future operating expenses and margins could be dependent on its ability to manage the impact of such cost increases. If energy costs increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along to drinkers through increased prices.\nThe Company\u2019s Advertising and Promotional Investments May Affect the Company\u2019s Financial Results but Not be Effective.\nThe Company has made, and expects to continue to make, significant advertising and promotional expenditures to enhance its brands, even though these expenditures may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in a particular quarter or even for the full year, and may not result in increased sales. Variations in the levels of advertising and promotional expenditures have in the past caused, and are expected in the future to continue to cause, variability in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations. While the Company attempts to invest only in effective advertising and promotional expenditures, it is difficult to correlate such investments with sales results, and there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s expenditures will be effective in building brand equity or growing long term sales.\nThe Company\u2019s Operations are Subject to Certain Operating Hazards Which Could Result in Unexpected Costs or Product Recalls That Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by all brewers, such as potential contamination of ingredients or products by bacteria or other external agents that may be wrongfully or accidentally introduced into products or packaging, or defective packaging and handling. Such occurrences may create bad tasting beer, hard cider or hard seltzer, or pose risk to the integrity and safety of the packaging. These could result in unexpected costs to the Company and, in the case of a costly product recall, potentially serious damage to the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality, as well as product liability claims.\nChanges in Tax, Environmental and Other Regulations or Failure to Comply with Existing Licensing, Trade or Other Regulations Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly regulated by federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing\npractices, relationships with Distributors, environmental impact of operations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent reevaluation, varying interpretations and political debate, and inquiries from governmental regulators charged with their enforcement. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations relating to the Company\u2019s operations or any revisions to such laws and regulations or the failure to pay taxes or other fees imposed on the Company\u2019s operations and results could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of the Company\u2019s licenses, permits or approvals, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in Federal and other tax rates could have significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nChanges in Public Attitudes and Drinker Tastes Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business. Regulatory Changes in Response to Public Attitudes Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe alcoholic beverage industry has become the subject of considerable societal and political attention in recent years, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including driving under the influence, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol, including alcoholism. As an outgrowth of these concerns, the possibility exists that advertising by beer producers could be restricted, that additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements might be imposed, that further restrictions on the sale of alcohol might be imposed or that there may be renewed efforts to impose increased excise or other taxes on beer sold in the United States.\nThe domestic beer industry, other than Better Beers, has experienced a slight decline in shipments over the last ten years. The Company believes that this slower growth is due to both declining alcohol consumption per person in the population and increased competition from wine and spirits companies. If beer consumption in general were to come into disfavor among domestic drinkers, or if the domestic beer industry were subjected to significant additional governmental regulations, the Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain states are considering or have passed laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of marijuana. It is possible that legal marijuana usage could adversely impact the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nImpact of Changes in Drinker Attitudes on Brand Equity and Inherent Risk of Reliance on the Company\u2019s Founder in the Samuel Adams\u00ae Brand Communications.\nThere is no guarantee that the brand equities that the Company has built in its brands will continue to appeal to drinkers. Changes in drinker attitudes or demands could adversely affect the strength of the Company\u2019s brands and the revenue that is generated from that strength. It is possible that the Company could react to such changes and reposition its brands, but there is no certainty that the Company would be able to maintain volumes, pricing power and profitability. It is also possible that marketing messages or other actions taken by the Company could damage its brand equities, as opposed to building them. If such damage were to occur, it would likely have a negative effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nIn addition to these inherent brand risks, the founder and Chairman of the Company, C. James Koch, is an integral part of the Company\u2019s Samuel Adams brand history, equity and current and potential future brand messaging and the Company relies on the positive public perception of its founder. The role of Mr. Koch as founder, brewer and leader of the Company is emphasized as part of the Company\u2019s brand communication and has appeal to some drinkers. If Mr. Koch were not available to the Company to continue his active role, his absence could negatively affect the strength of the Company\u2019s messaging and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s growth prospects. The Company and its brands may also be impacted if drinkers\u2019 views of Mr. Koch were to negatively change. If either of these were to occur, the Company might need to adapt its strategy for communicating its key messages regarding its traditional brewing processes, brewing heritage and quality. Any such change in the Company\u2019s messaging strategy might have a detrimental impact on the future growth of the Company.\nThere Is No Guarantee that the Company Will not Face Litigation that Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nWhile the Company has from time to time in the past been involved in material litigation, it is not currently a party to any pending or threatened litigation, the outcome of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or the results of its operations. In general, while the Company believes it conducts its business appropriately in accordance with laws, regulations and industry guidelines, claims, whether or not meritorious, could be asserted against the Company that might adversely impact the Company\u2019s results. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below.\nThe Class B Shareholder Has Significant Influence over the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock is not entitled to any voting rights except for the right as a class to (1) approve certain mergers, charter amendments and by-law amendments and (2) elect a minority of the directors of the Company. Although not as a matter of right, the Class A stockholders have also been afforded the opportunity to vote on an advisory basis on executive compensation. Consequently, the election of a majority of the Company\u2019s directors and all other matters requiring stockholder approval are currently decided by C. James Koch, who is the founder and Chairman of the Company, as the holder of 100% of the voting rights to the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Koch is able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the composition of the board of directors, approval of equity-based and other executive compensation and other significant corporate and governance matters, such as approval of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and makes most material transactions difficult or impossible to accomplish without the support of Mr. Koch. In addition, Mr. Koch could transfer some shares of the Class B Common Stock to others, which could impact the nature of the control currently held by him as the sole holder of the Class B Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Operating Results and Cash Flow May Be Adversely Affected by Unfavorable Economic and Financial Market Conditions.\nVolatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and economic conditions may directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s performance and operating results in a variety of ways, including: (a) prices for energy and agricultural products may rise faster than current estimates, including increases resulting from currency fluctuations; (b) the Company\u2019s key suppliers may not be able to fund their capital requirements, resulting in disruption in the supplies of the Company\u2019s raw and packaging materials; (c) the credit risks of the Company\u2019s Distributors may increase; (d) the impact of currency fluctuations on amounts owed to the Company by distributors that pay in foreign currencies; (e) the Company\u2019s credit facility, or portion thereof, may become unavailable at a time when needed by the Company to meet critical needs; (f) overall beer consumption may decline; or (g) drinkers of the Company\u2019s beers may change their purchase preferences and frequency, which might result in sales declines.\nThe Company Relies Upon Complex Information Systems.\nThe Company depends on information technology to be able to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial and accounting reporting accuracy to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. If the Company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, the Company could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. The Company recognizes that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity. The Company has dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats. However, as with all large information technology systems, the Company\u2019s systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting information, disrupting business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic\ninformation. Such unauthorized access could disrupt business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, remediation costs or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as litigation against the Company by third parties adversely affected by the unauthorized access. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The Company also relies on third parties for supply of software, software and data hosting and telecommunications and networking, and is reliant on those third parties for the quality and integrity of these complex services. Failure by a third party supplier could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to operate.", "PERMNO": 82634, "SIC": 2082, "TIC": "SAM"}
