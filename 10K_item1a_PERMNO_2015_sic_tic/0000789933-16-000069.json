RISK FACTORS\nNorth American Coal\nTermination of or default under long-term mining contracts could materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nSubstantially all of NACoal's profits are derived from long-term mining contracts. The contracts for certain of NACoal's unconsolidated mines permit or obligate the customer under some conditions to acquire the assets or stock of the NACoal subsidiary for an amount roughly equal to book value. If any of NACoal's long-term mining contracts were terminated or if any of its customers were to default under the contracts, profitability could be materially reduced to the extent that NACoal is unable to find alternative customers at the same level of profitability.\nNACoal's unconsolidated mines are subject to risks created by changes in customer demand, inflationary adjustments and tax rates.\nThe contracts with the unconsolidated mines\u2019 customers provide for reimbursement to the Company at a price based on actual costs plus an agreed pre-tax profit per ton of coal sold or actual costs plus a management fee during the production stage.\nDuring the development stage, the contracts with the unconsolidated mines' customers (other than the Coyote Creek and Bisti customers) provide for reimbursement of actual costs incurred plus a monthly management fee. Coyote Creek's customer does not reimburse developments costs until the production stage, when certain deferred development costs are reimbursed over a 52-month period. Bisti's customer does not reimburse transition period costs until the production stage, when all transition costs are reimbursed over a 24-month period. During the production stage, the unconsolidated mines' customers pay the Company its per-ton profit or management fee only for the coal delivered to them for consumption or use . As a result, reduced coal usage by customers for any reason, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, scheduled and unscheduled power plant outages, economic conditions or governmental regulations or comparable policies which may promote dispatch of power generated by renewables such as wind or solar ahead of coal, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Because of the contractual price formulas for the sale of coal and mining services by these unconsolidated mines, the profitability of these operations is also subject to fluctuations in inflationary adjustments (or lack thereof) that can impact the per ton profit or management fee paid for the coal and taxes applicable to NACoal's income on that coal. In addition, any changes in tax laws that eliminate benefits for percentage depletion would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors could materially reduce NACoal's profitability.\nNACoal\u2019s consolidated mining operations are subject to risks created by its capital investment in the mines, the costs of mining the coal and equipment costs, growing use of alternative generation that competes with coal fired generation, in addition to risks created by changes in customer demand, inflationary adjustments and tax rates.\nThe consolidated mining operations are comprised of MLMC, Centennial, dragline mining services, royalties from mineral leases to other mining and oil and gas companies, and other activities. The profitability of these consolidated mining operations is subject to the risk of loss of investment in these operations, changes in demand from customers, as well as increases in the cost of mining the coal and growing competition from alternative generation that competes with coal fired generation. At MLMC, the costs of mining operations are not reimbursed by customers. As such, increased costs at MLMC could materially reduce NACoal's profitability. In addition, MLMC sells lignite at contractually agreed upon coal prices which are subject to changes in the level of established indices over time. The price of diesel fuel is heavily-weighted among these indices. As such, a substantial decline in diesel prices could materially reduce NACoal's profitability, as the decline in revenue will only be partially offset by the effect of lower diesel prices on production costs.\nNACoal's operations are subject to changes in customer demand for any reason, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, the emergence of unidentified adverse mining conditions, availability of alternative fuels such as natural gas at reduced prices making coal-fueled generation less competitive with natural gas-fueled generation, regulations or comparable policies which may promote dispatch of power generated by renewables such as wind or solar ahead of coal, planned and unplanned power plant outages, economic conditions, including economic conditions that adversely affect the demand for coal and steel, governmental regulations, inflationary adjustments and tax risks. In addition, any changes in tax laws that eliminate benefits for percentage depletion or eliminate the expensing of exploration and development costs could have a material adverse effect on NACoal's profitability.\nMining operations are vulnerable to weather and other conditions that are beyond NACoal's control.\nMany conditions beyond NACoal's control can decrease the delivery, and therefore the use, of coal to NACoal's customers. These conditions include weather, adverse mining conditions, availability of alternative fuels such as natural gas at reduced prices making coal-fueled generation less competitive with natural gas-fueled generation, unexpected maintenance problems and shortages of replacement parts, which could significantly reduce the Company's profitability.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on NACoal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters concerning the health and safety of employees, land use, permit and licensing requirements, air and water quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining, the discharge of GHGs and other materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Legislation mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners also affects the industry. Mining operations require numerous governmental permits and approvals. NACoal is required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the impact the production of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals. Compliance with these requirements may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of development or production. New legislation and/or regulations and orders may materially adversely affect NACoal's mining operations or its cost structure. All of these factors could significantly reduce the Company's profitability. See \u201cItem 1. Business - A. North American Coal - Government Regulation\" on page 11 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNACoal is subject to burdensome federal and state mining regulations.\nFederal and state statutes require NACoal to restore mine property in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan, and require that NACoal obtain and periodically renew permits for mining operations. Regulations require NACoal to incur the cost of reclaiming current mine disturbance. Although the Company believes that appropriate accruals have been recorded for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with closed mines, future profitability would be adversely affected if accruals for these costs are later determined to be insufficient or if changed conditions, including adverse judicial proceedings or revised assumptions, require a change in these reserves.\nThe Clean Air Act and Clean Power Plan could reduce the demand for coal.\nThe process of burning coal can cause many compounds and impurities in the coal to be released into the air, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulates and other matter. The CAA, CPP and the corresponding state laws that extensively regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations occur through CAA permitting requirements and/or CPP emission control requirements relating to air contaminants, especially particulate matter. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations occur through regulation of the air emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulate matter and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The EPA has promulgated or proposed regulations that impose tighter emission restrictions on a number of these compounds, some of which are currently subject to litigation. The general effect of tighter restrictions could be to reduce demand for coal. A reduction in coal\u2019s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - A. North American Coal - Government Regulation\" on page 11 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNACoal is subject to the high costs and risks involved in the development of new coal and dragline mining projects.\nFrom time to time, NACoal seeks to develop new coal and dragline mining projects. The costs and risks associated with such projects can be substantial. In addition, any changes in tax laws that eliminate the expensing of exploration and development costs will increase the after-tax cost of building a mine and make the cost of coal less competitive with other power-generation fuels.\nEstimates of NACoal's recoverable coal reserves involve uncertainties, and inaccuracies in these estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nNACoal estimates recoverable coal reserves based on engineering and geological data assembled and analyzed by internal and, less frequently, external engineers and geologists. NACoal's estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in its reserves are updated annually to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling, engineering or other data. These estimates depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties and factors beyond NACoal's control, such as geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves may vary substantially. In addition, coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to NACoal's reserves may vary materially from estimates. Accordingly, NACoal's estimates may vary from the actual reserves. Any inaccuracy in the reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nHamilton Beach Brands\nHBB's business is sensitive to the strength of the North American retail markets and weakness in these markets could adversely affect its business.\nThe strength of the retail economy in the United States, and to a lesser degree in Canada and Mexico, has a significant impact on HBB's performance. Weakness in consumer confidence and poor financial performance by mass merchandisers,\ne-commerce retailers, warehouse clubs, department stores or any of HBB's other customers could result in reduced revenues and profitability. A general slowdown in the retail sector could result in additional pricing and marketing support pressures on HBB.\nThe market for HBB's products is highly seasonal and dependent on consumer spending, which could result in significant variations in the Company's revenues and profitability.\nSales of HBB's products are related to consumer spending. A downturn in the general economy or a shift in consumer spending away from small electric household and specialty housewares appliances could adversely affect its business. In addition, the market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. HBB generally recognizes a substantial portion of its sales in the last half of the year as sales of small electric appliances to retailers and consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Accordingly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of past operating results of HBB are meaningful only when comparing equivalent time periods, if at all. Any economic downturn, decrease in consumer spending or shift in consumer spending away from small electric household and specialty housewares appliances may significantly reduce revenues and profitability.\nHBB is dependent on key customers and the loss of, or significant decline in business from, one or more of its key customers could materially reduce its revenues and profitability and its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB relies on several key customers, which is discussed under \u201cItem 1. Business - B. Hamilton Beach Brands - Sales and Marketing\" on page 16 in this Form 10-K. Although HBB has long-established relationships with many customers, it does not have any long-term supply contracts with these customers, and purchases are generally made using individual purchase orders. A loss of any key customer could result in significant decreases in HBB's revenues and profitability and an inability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB must receive a continuous flow of new orders from its large, high-volume retail customers; however, it may be unable to continually meet the needs of those customers. In addition, failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders or significant pressure to reduce prices from key customers could impair its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nAs a result of dependence on its key customers, HBB could experience a material adverse effect on its revenues and profitability if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022the insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer;\n\u2022a declining market in which customers materially reduce orders or demand lower prices; or\n\u2022a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers.\nIf HBB were to lose, or experience a significant decline in business from, any major retail customer or if any major retail customers were to go bankrupt, HBB might be unable to find alternate distribution outlets.\nHBB depends on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of all of its products, which subjects the Company to risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain.\nHBB is dependent on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of all of its products. HBB's ability to select reliable suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products will impact its success in meeting customer demand. Any inability of HBB's suppliers to timely deliver products that meet HBB's specifications or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the Company. Any significant failure by HBB to obtain quality products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply would have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues and profitability.\nBecause HBB's suppliers are primarily based in China, international operations subject the Company to additional risks including, among others:\n\u2022currency fluctuations;\n\u2022labor unrest;\n\u2022potential political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022lack of developed infrastructure;\n\u2022restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022import and export duties and quotas;\n\u2022changes in domestic and international customs and tariffs;\n\u2022uncertainties involving the costs to transport products;\n\u2022long distance shipping routes dependent upon a small group of shipping and rail carriers;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022regulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;\n\u2022protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences.\nThe foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on HBB's ability to maintain or increase the supply of products, which may result in material increases in expenses and decreases in revenues and profitability.\nHBB is subject to foreign currency exchange risk\nA portion of HBB's revenues is derived from international operations, and HBB anticipates that a portion of sales will continue to come from outside the U.S. in the future. HBB's international revenues may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations is contained in \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\". Any hedging activities HBB engages in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HBB cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which HBB can mitigate these risks.\nIncreases in costs of products may materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nFactors that are largely beyond the Company's control, such as movements in commodity prices for the raw materials needed by suppliers of HBB's products, may affect the cost of products, and HBB may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. As an example, HBB's products require a substantial amount of plastic. Because the primary resource used in plastic is petroleum, the cost and availability of plastic varies to a great extent with the price of petroleum. When the prices of petroleum, as well as steel, aluminum and copper, increase significantly, they may materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nThe increasing concentration of HBB's small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among a few retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenues and profitability.\nWith the growing trend towards the concentration of HBB's small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among a few retailers, HBB is increasingly dependent upon fewer customers whose bargaining strength is growing as a result of this concentration. HBB sells a substantial quantity of products to mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers and other retail outlets. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances. As a result, HBB competes for retail shelf space with its competitors. In addition, certain of HBB's larger customers use their own private label brands on household appliances that compete directly with some of HBB's products. As the retailers in the small electric household appliance industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.\nThe small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry is consolidating, which could reduce HBB's ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.\nOver the past several years, the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry primarily consists of a limited number of large distributors. HBB\u2019s ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry or maintain or enhance HBB\u2019s relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors, including as a result of increased consolidation in the small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry.\nIf HBB is unable to continue to enhance existing products, as well as develop and market new products, that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, the Company may experience a decrease in demand for its products, which could materially reduce revenues and profitability, which have historically benefited from sales of new products.\nOne of HBB\u2019s strategic initiatives is to enhance placements through consumer-driven innovative products to generate revenue growth. HBB may not be able to compete as effectively with competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of customers, unless HBB can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which HBB competes. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological and product process levels and HBB may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Competitors' new products may beat HBB\u2019s products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features, obtain better market acceptance, or render HBB\u2019s products obsolete. Any new products that HBB develops may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful revenues or profits for the Company relative to our expectations based on, among other things, commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and development.\nHBB's inability to compete effectively with competitors in its industry, including large established companies with greater resources, could result in lost market share and decreased revenues.\nThe small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many small manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Additional competitors may also enter this market and cause competition to intensify. For example, some of HBB's customers have expressed interest in sourcing, or expanding the extent of sourcing, small electric household and commercial appliances directly from manufacturers in Asia. The Company believes competition is based upon several factors, including product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, merchandising, promotion and warranty. If HBB fails to compete effectively with these manufacturers and distributors, it could lose market share and experience a decrease in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nHBB also competes with established companies, a number of which have substantially greater facilities, personnel, financial and other resources. In addition, HBB competes with retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and importers and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products. Some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete. As a result of this competition, HBB could lose market share and revenues.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on HBB.\nThe SEC adopted conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of Dodd-Frank on August 22, 2012. The rules require disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as \"conflict minerals,\" which are mined from the DRC and adjoining countries. HBB expects that it will incur additional costs and expenses, which may be significant, in order to comply with these rules, including (i) due diligence to verify the sources of such conflict minerals; and (ii) any changes that HBB may make to its products, processes, or sources of supply as a result of such diligence and verification activities. Since HBB's supply chain is complex, ultimately it may not be able to designate all products as \"DRC conflict free\" which may adversely affect its reputation with certain customers. In such event, HBB may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require products purchased from HBB to be \"DRC conflict free\". If HBB is not able to meet such requirements, customers may choose not to purchase HBB products, which could adversely affect sales and the value of portions of HBB's inventory. Further, there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products containing only DRC conflict free parts, components and subassemblies and, as a result, HBB cannot be sure that it will be able to satisfy its purchase requirements from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Any one or a combination of these various factors could harm HBB's business, and materially and adversely affect HBB's results of operations.\nKitchen Collection\nThe market for KC's products is highly seasonal and dependent on consumer spending, which could result in significant variations in the Company's revenues and profitability.\nSales of products sold at KC stores are subject to a number of factors related to consumer spending, including general economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment rates, business conditions, interest rates, levels of consumer confidence, energy prices, mortgage rates, the level of consumer debt and taxation. In addition, KC generally recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues and operating profit in the last half of the year as sales to consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Accordingly, any economic downturn, decrease in consumer\nspending or a shift in consumer spending away from KC's products could significantly reduce, or cause significant variations in, KC's revenues and profitability.\nKC faces an extremely competitive specialty retail market, and such competition could result in a reduction of KC's prices and loss of market share.\nThe retail market is highly competitive. KC competes against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores and internet and catalog retailers. Widespread sourcing of products allows many retailers to offer value-priced kitchen products. Many of KC's competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources. This competition could result in the reduction of KC product prices and a loss of market share, revenues and profitability.\nKC may not be able to forecast customer preferences accurately in its merchandise selections.\nKC's success depends in part on its ability to anticipate the tastes of its customers and to provide merchandise that appeals to their preferences. KC's strategy requires merchandising staff to introduce products that meet current customer preferences and that are affordable and distinctive in quality and design. KC's failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer trends could cause excess inventories and higher mark-downs or a shortage of products and could harm KC's business and operating results.\nKC depends on third-party suppliers for all of its products, which subjects KC to risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain.\nKC is dependent on third-party suppliers for all of its products. KC's inability to select reliable suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products could reduce its success in meeting customer demand. Any inability of KC's suppliers to timely deliver products or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to KC. The loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect KC\u2019s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured. In addition, KC may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms in the future. KC's business could also be adversely affected by delays in product shipments due to freight difficulties, strikes or other difficulties at its principal transport providers. Any significant failure by KC to obtain products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply could have a material adverse effect on KC's profitability.\nNACCO\nThe Company may be subject to risk relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans, which may affect its financial position.\nAlthough the Company's defined benefit pension plans are frozen and no longer provide for the accrual of future benefits, the expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to its defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require the Company to increase the cash contributed to defined benefit pension plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe Company may become subject to claims under foreign laws and regulations, which may be expensive, time consuming and distracting.\nBecause the Company has employees, property and business operations outside of the United States, the Company is subject to the laws and the court systems of many jurisdictions. The Company may become subject to claims outside the U.S. for violations or alleged violations of laws with respect to the current or future foreign operations of NACoal and HBB. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. International litigation is often expensive, time consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce the Company's profitability and its ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of its key personnel and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company's success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel. The Company's inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its business effectively and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe amount and frequency of dividend payments made on NACCO's common stock could change.\nThe Board of Directors has the power to determine the amount and frequency of the payment of dividends. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are based on earnings, capital and future expense requirements, financial conditions, contractual limitations and other factors the Board of Directors may consider. Accordingly, holders of NACCO's common stock should not rely on past payments of dividends in a particular amount as an indication of the amount of dividends that will be paid in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if NACCO\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted,cease to operate effectively or if the Company experiences a security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on information technology systems to operate websites; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory; purchase, sell and ship merchandise on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of computer hardware and software systems and maintain cyber security. Despite the Company's cyber security efforts, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power outages, third-party intrusions and other technical malfunctions. If the Company\u2019s systems are damaged, or fail to function properly, NACCO may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems and could endure delays in operations.\nIn addition, the Company regularly evaluates information technology systems and requirements and from time to time implements modifications and/or upgrades to the information technology systems that support its businesses. Modifications include replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems and acquiring new systems with new functionality. There are inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. The Company believes it is taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through disciplined adherence to program management, testing systems and user involvement, improving the resiliency of systems, as well as securing appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors but there can be no assurance that the Company's actions will be successful or sufficient.\nAny material disruption or slowdown of the Company\u2019s systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by a security breach or the Company\u2019s failure to successfully upgrade its systems, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed. Such a loss or delay could reduce demand and cause the Company\u2019s sales and/or profitability to decline.\nThrough the Company\u2019s sales and marketing activities and its business operations, the Company collects and stores confidential information and certain personal information from its customers, vendors and employees. For example, the Company handles, collects and stores personal information in connection with its customers purchasing products or services, or otherwise communicating or interacting with the Company. The Company also accepts payments using a variety of methods, including debit and credit cards, gift cards, electronic transfer of funds and others. Although the Company has taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Unauthorized parties may penetrate the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. Additionally, methods to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information change frequently and may be difficult to detect, which can impact the Company\u2019s ability to respond appropriately. The Company could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information or for failing to respond appropriately. Loss, unauthorized access to, or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain members of the Company's extended founding family own a substantial amount of its Class A and Class B common stock and, if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions.\nThe Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2015, accounted for approximately 25 percent of the voting power of the Company. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2015, accounted for the remaining voting power of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, certain members of the Company's extended founding family held approximately 35 percent of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 98 percent of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of the Company's extended founding family could have exercised 82 percent of the Company's total voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such extended family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions, such as certain amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and sales of the Company or\nsubstantially all of its assets. Because certain members of the Company's extended founding family could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, the Company may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 28118, "SIC": 1221, "TIC": "NC"}
