{"cik": "1013488", "company": "BJs RESTAURANTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors presented below may affect our future operating results, financial position and cash flows. The risks described in this Item 1A and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not exhaustive and are not the only risks we may ever face in our business. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us. There may be other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that are currently deemed by us to be immaterial. However, they may ultimately adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition to the risk factors presented below, changes in general economic conditions, credit markets, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns, demographic trends, and consumer confidence in the economy, all of which affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions, may have a material impact on us.\nRisks Related to our Restaurant Business, Operations and Future Growth\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive. Any inability to maintain our brand image and compete effectively in the restaurant industry may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial results.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of the taste, quality and price of food offered, customer service, brand name identification, beer quality and selection, facilities attractiveness, restaurant location, atmosphere and overall dining experience. In addition, we compete with other restaurants and retailers for real estate. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to well-capitalized national restaurant companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.\nWe face growing competition as a result of the increasing prevalence of food-away-from-home at fast casual restaurants, single-serve operations, quick-service restaurants and the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers \u201cconvenient meals\u201d in the form of improved entr\u00e9es and side dishes from the deli section, combined with the continuing pressure on consumer discretionary spending for restaurant occasions, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives to BJ\u2019s. We may also need to evolve the BJ\u2019s restaurant concept in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that emerge from time to time, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so, or that any changes we make to our concept in response will be successful or not adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to effectively compete, the successful operation of the BJ\u2019s restaurant concept and the execution of our national expansion plan are all highly dependent upon BJ\u2019s ability to remain relevant to consumers and being a brand they trust. We believe that we have built a favorable reputation for the quality and differentiation of our restaurant concept. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for the BJ\u2019s brand may significantly reduce its value. If consumers perceive or experience any reduction in our food or beverage quality, service or facility ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive dining experience, our ability to compete and the value of the BJ\u2019s brand may be impaired. In addition, if other restaurants are able to promote and deliver a higher degree of perceived value through heavy discounting or other methods, our customer traffic levels may suffer which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nNegative publicity about us, our restaurants, other restaurants, or others across the food supply chain, due to food borne illness or for other reasons, whether or not accurate, may adversely affect the reputation and popularity of our restaurants and our results of operations.\nThe good reputation of our restaurants is a key factor to the success of our business. Incidents that occur at any of our\nrestaurants, or at restaurants operated by other foodservice providers or generally in the food supply chain, may be damaging to the restaurant industry overall, may specifically harm our brand and reputation and may quickly result in negative publicity for us, which may adversely affect our sales and popularity with our customers. Moreover, negative publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, injury, food tampering or other health concerns, whether related to one of our restaurants, to the restaurant industry, or to the beef, seafood, poultry or produce industries (such as negative publicity concerning the accumulation of carcinogens in seafood, e-coli, hepatitis A, Avian Flu, listeria, salmonella, and other food-borne illnesses), or operating problems related to one or more of our restaurants, may adversely affect sales for all of our restaurants and make our brand and menu offerings less appealing to consumers.\nIn addition, our brewing operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by all brewers, such as potential contamination of ingredients or products by bacteria or other external agents that may be wrongfully or accidentally introduced into products or packaging. While we have not experienced any serious contamination problem in our products, the occurrence of such a problem may result in a costly product recall and serious damage to our reputation for product quality, as well as claims for product liability.\nHealth concerns arising from food-borne or other illnesses or specific categories of foods may adversely affect our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as COVID-19 pandemic, Avian Flu or \u201cSARS,\u201d and H1N1 or \u201cswine flu,\u201d or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which may adversely affect our restaurant customer traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also may be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we follow industry standard food safety protocols and continue to enhance our food safety and quality assurance procedures, no food safety protocols can completely eliminate the risk of food-borne illness in any restaurant. To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, any future outbreaks or the possibility of such outbreaks may adversely affect customer traffic generally or the price and availability of certain food products which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Even if food-borne illnesses arise from conditions outside of our control, the negative publicity from any such illnesses is likely to be significant. If our restaurant customers or employees become ill from food-borne illnesses, we may be forced to temporarily close the affected restaurants.\nIn addition, public concern over health risks associated with certain foods may cause fear about the consumption of menu items which incorporate such foods. If we change our menu in response to such concerns, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to sufficiently attract new customers to produce the revenue needed to restore the profitability of our restaurant operations.\nIncreases or changes in off-premise sales may adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the last several years, off-premise sales have increased due to consumer demand for convenience and more recently as a result of local and state restrictions on dine-in capacity imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth in sales from off-premise channels which are now material to our business. Delivery from our restaurants is primarily accomplished by utilizing third party delivery companies. These third party delivery companies require us to pay them a commission, which adversely affects our profit margin on those sales. Off-premise sales could cannibalize dine-in sales, or our systems and procedures may not be sufficient to handle off-premise sales, which require additional investments in technology or people. To the extent that off-premise sales significantly reduce dine-in customer traffic or result in the need for additional expenditures to meet demand, our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, if third party delivery services cease doing business with us, or cannot make their scheduled deliveries, or do not continue their relationship with us on favorable terms, it would have a negative impact on sales or result in increased third party delivery fees.\nAny deterioration in general economic conditions which adversely affects consumer spending, our landlords or businesses neighboring our locations, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny decrease in customer traffic or the average expenditure per customer, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, will negatively impact our financial results, since reduced sales result in the deleveraging of the fixed and semi-fixed costs in our operations and thereby cause downward pressure on our operating profits and margins. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.\nIn addition, deterioration in general economic conditions may adversely affect our landlords' abilities to satisfy obligations to us under leases, including failures to fund or reimburse agreed-upon tenant improvement allowances. If our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail centers, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such centers where we operate restaurants. Our future development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situation of developers and potential landlords. Any such adverse developments with respect to our landlords may adversely impact our operations.\nOur restaurants are generally located in or around high traffic retail developments with nationally recognized co-tenants, which help increase overall customer traffic into those retail developments. Some of our co-tenants have ceased or may cease operations in the future or have deferred openings or fail to open in a retail development after committing to do so. These failures may lead to reduced customer traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our restaurants are located and may contribute to lower customer traffic at our restaurants. If these retail developments experience high vacancy rates, any resulting decrease in customer traffic may adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in consumer buying patterns, particularly e-commerce sites and off-premise sales affect our revenues, operating results and liquidity.\nOur restaurants are primarily located near high consumer activity areas such as regional malls, lifestyle centers, \u201cbig box\u201d shopping centers and entertainment centers. We depend in large part on a high volume of visitors to these centers to attract customers to our restaurants. E-commerce or online shopping continues to increase and negatively impact consumer traffic at traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, \u201cbig box\u201d shopping centers and entertainment centers. A decline in visitors to these centers near our restaurants may negatively affect our sales. Closures of traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites may lead to reduced customer traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our restaurants are located and may contribute to lower customer traffic at our restaurants.\nAny adverse change in consumer trends or traffic levels may adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations.\nDue to the nature of the restaurant industry, we are dependent upon consumer trends with respect to the public\u2019s tastes, eating habits, public perception toward alcohol consumption and discretionary spending priorities, all of which can shift rapidly. We also are dependent upon high consumer traffic rates at the sites surrounding our restaurants, which are primarily located in high-activity areas such as urban, retail, mixed-use and lifestyle centers, to attract customers to our restaurants. In general, such consumer trends and visit frequencies are significantly affected by many factors, including national, regional or local economic conditions, changes in area demographics, public perception and attitudes, increases in regional competition, food, liquor and labor costs, traffic and shopping patterns, weather, natural disasters, interest rates, co-tenancies in urban, retail and mixed-use and lifestyle centers and the availability and relative cost of gasoline. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to such changing consumer preferences, tastes, eating and purchasing habits, as well as other factors affecting the restaurant industry, including new market entrants and demographic changes. Any adverse change in any of the above factors and our inability to respond to such changes may cause our restaurant volumes to decline and adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations.\nAny inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media may adversely affect our business.\nThere has been a significant increase in the use of social media and similar platforms. Consumers value readily available information concerning goods and services that they have or plan to purchase, and may act on such information without further investigation or authentication. The dissemination of information online regarding our Company or our restaurants, together with any resulting negative publicity, may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we use a variety of digital platforms including search engines, mobile, online videos and social media platforms such as Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae and Instagram\u00ae to attract and retain customers. We also test new technology platforms to improve our level of digital engagement with our customers and employees to help strengthen our marketing and related consumer analytics capabilities. These initiatives may not prove to be successful and may result in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased engagement.\nOur inability or failure to successfully and sufficiently raise menu prices to offset rising costs and expenses may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn the past, we have experienced dramatic price increases of certain items necessary to operate our restaurants and brewing operations, including increases in the cost of food, commodities, labor, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, energy and other costs. We utilize menu price increases to help offset the increased cost of commodities,\nminimum wage and other costs. However, there is no guarantee that our menu price increases will be accepted by our customers. If our costs increase, our operating margins and results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase our menu prices to offset such increased costs or if our increased menu prices result in less customer traffic. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that menu price increases will not deter customers from visiting our restaurants, reduce the frequency of their visits or affect their purchasing decisions.\nOur past and recent trends in average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales may not be indicative of future trends or future operating results.\nOur past average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales trends prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be indicative of future trends or future operating results. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we may return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales trends. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to operate our restaurants in full capacity and without local or state restrictions;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute productively and efficiently within the \u201cfour walls\u201d of each restaurant;\n\u2022\nour menu development and pricing strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue deploying menu, beverage, capital expenditure and technological innovations that have the opportunity to increase customer visit frequency and spending per visit;\n\u2022\ninitial sales performance by new restaurants, some of which may be unusually strong and thus difficult to increase further;\n\u2022\nintrusions into our restaurant trade areas by new restaurants operated by competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses;\n\u2022\nchanging demographics, consumer tastes or discretionary spending;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop restaurants in geographic locations that do not compete with or otherwise adversely affect the sales of our existing restaurants;\n\u2022\noverall brand awareness in new markets or existing markets where we may develop new restaurants;\n\u2022\nmaturation of the casual dining segment;\n\u2022\nchanges in the trade area, retail development or surrounding area in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlevels of competition in one or more of our markets; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, credit markets and consumer confidence.\nWe believe that certain of our restaurants operate at or near their effective productive capacities. As a result, we may be unable to grow or maintain comparable restaurant sales at those restaurants, particularly if additional restaurants are opened near the existing locations either by us or by our competitors.\nAny failure to drive both short-term and long-term profitable sales growth through continued enhancements to the BJ\u2019s restaurant concept and brand, coupled with any slippage in restaurant operational execution, may result in poor financial performance. As part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing sales at existing restaurants and by opening new restaurants. This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives. If we are unable to maintain BJ\u2019s brand relevance and restaurant operational excellence to achieve sustainable comparable restaurant sales growth, we may have to consider slowing the pace of new restaurant openings. BJ\u2019s short-term sales growth may be impacted if we are unable to drive near-term growth in customer traffic, and long-term sales growth may be impacted if we fail to continue to evolve BJ\u2019s to maintain its relevance, contemporary energy and overall value and appeal to the consumer. The casual dining segment, in general, has not seen any significant growth in customer traffic in several years. If this trend continues, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment.\nAdverse changes in our average restaurant revenues and comparable restaurant sales may have an adverse effect on our common stock or increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nAny inability or failure to successfully expand our restaurant operations may adversely affect our growth rate and results of operations.\nA critical factor in our future success is our ability to expand our restaurant operations successfully, which will depend in large part on our ability to open new restaurants in a profitable manner. We anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months or even longer to reach targeted productivity levels due to the inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including lack of initial market and consumer awareness, the need to hire and train sufficient management and restaurant personnel and other factors. The opening of new restaurants can also have either an expected or an unintended effect on the sales levels at existing restaurants. We cannot guarantee that any restaurant we open will obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. If we are unable to open and operate new restaurants successfully, our growth rate and our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our expansion plans may also be impacted by the delay or cancellation of potential new sites by developers and landlords, which may become more common as a result of economic deterioration or tightening credit markets.\nWe intend to open new restaurants in both established and new markets. Opening new restaurants in established markets generally provides some advantages in the form of stronger levels of initial consumer awareness, trial and usage, as well as greater leverage of certain supply chain and field supervision resources. On the other hand, there is a risk that a portion of the sales of existing restaurants in the market may transfer to newly opened restaurants in the same market, resulting in negative pressure on our overall comparable restaurant sales metric. While we do not generally select locations for our new restaurants where we believe that a significant sales transfer will likely occur, some unexpected sales transfer may inadvertently occur.\nSome of our new restaurants may be planned for new markets where we have little or no operating experience. New markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. As a result, new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. Consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the BJ\u2019s brand. We also may find it more difficult to hire, motivate and retain qualified employees in new markets. Restaurants opened in new markets may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in our existing markets, and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to achieve margins typical of mature restaurants in existing markets or may never achieve these targeted margins thereby affecting our overall profitability. As we expand into new markets and geographic territories, our operating cost structures may not resemble our experience in existing markets. Because there will initially be fewer restaurants in a given market, our ability to optimally leverage our field supervision, marketing and supply chain resources will be limited for a period of time. Further, our overall new restaurant development and operating costs may increase due to more lengthy geographic distances between restaurants resulting in higher purchasing, preopening, labor, transportation and supervision costs. The performance of restaurants in new markets will often be less predictable.\nAs part of our ongoing restaurant expansion and growth strategy, we may consider the internal development or acquisition of additional restaurant concepts. We may not be able to internally develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants. Additionally, growth through acquisitions will also involve additional financial and operational risks.\nAny inability to open new restaurants on schedule in accordance with our targeted capacity growth or problems associated with securing suitable restaurant locations, leases and licenses, recruiting and training qualified managers and hourly employees and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to forecast accurately may adversely affect our operations.\nIn order to achieve our targeted capacity rate of new restaurant growth, we must identify suitable restaurant locations and successfully negotiate and finalize the terms of restaurant leases at a number of these locations. Due in part to the unique nature of each proposed restaurant location, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate success of our site selection process or these lease negotiations. Delays encountered in negotiating, or our inability to finalize to our satisfaction, the terms of a restaurant lease, or disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may delay our actual rate of new restaurant growth and cause a significant variance from our targeted capacity growth rate. In addition, our scheduled rate of new restaurant openings may be adversely affected by other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of suitable restaurant locations for development;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete successfully for suitable restaurant locations;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate financing;\n\u2022\nthe timing of delivery of leased premises from our landlords so we can commence our build-out construction activities;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development costs;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages or disputes experienced by our landlords or outside contractors, including their ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which may delay construction and may create adverse publicity for our business and operations;\n\u2022\nany unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain additional management and restaurant personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure governmental approvals and permits, including liquor licenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to make satisfactory arrangements for the delivery of our proprietary craft beer;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully promote our new restaurants and compete in the markets in which our new restaurants are located;\n\u2022\nweather conditions or natural disasters; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nOur inability to renew existing leases on favorable terms may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe majority of our restaurants are located on leased premises and are subject to varying lease-specific arrangements. Some of our leases require base rent that is subject to regional cost-of-living increases and other leases include base rent with specified periodic increases. Other leases are subject to renewal at fair market value, which may involve substantial increases. Additionally, many leases require contingent rent based on a percentage of gross sales. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring leases after exercising all remaining renewal options. As a result, we may incur additional costs to operate our restaurants, including increased rent and other costs related to our renegotiation of lease terms for an existing leased premise or for a new lease in a desirable location and the relocation and development of a replacement restaurant.\nAny inability to retain key personnel or difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel may adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement is found.\nThe success of our business continues to depend on the contributions of our senior management team, both individually and as a group. Our senior executives have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. Losing the services of any of these individuals may materially adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement is found. We believe that these individuals cannot easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities. Although we have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we cannot prevent him from terminating his employment with us.\nAdditionally, when unemployment levels are at low, it is difficult and more expensive for us to fully staff our restaurants. While we do our best to avoid business interruptions in our operating restaurants, as well as delays in opening our new restaurants, there is no guarantee or assurance that we can avoid this in the future.\nAny adverse changes in the supply or cost of food, brewing, energy and other expenses may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively react to changes in food, labor, utilities and supply costs. Our supply chain department negotiates prices for all of our ingredients and supplies through contracts (with terms of one month up to one year, or longer in a few cases), spot market purchases or commodity pricing formulas. Furthermore, various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulations, including stricter health regulations and guidelines as well as increased public concern over food safety standards and local and state governmental requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially harm our business and may also cause our food and supply costs to increase. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food and supply costs or safety incidents by adjusting our purchasing practices. A failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results or cash flows from operations. We also have a single or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our commodity and supply items. Accordingly, supply chain risk may increase our costs and limit the availability of some products that are critical to our restaurant and brewing operations.\nThe overall cost environment for food commodities can be volatile primarily due to domestic and worldwide agricultural supply/demand and other macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control. The availability and prices of food commodities are also influenced by energy prices, droughts, animal-related diseases, natural disasters, increased geo-political tensions, the relationship of the dollar to other currencies, government regulated tariffs, regulations and requirements from the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues. Virtually all commodities purchased and used in the restaurant industry (meats, grains, oils, dairy products, and energy) have varying amounts of inherent price volatility associated with them. Our suppliers also\nmay be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants and brewpubs, higher minimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which may result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. While we attempt to manage these factors by offering a diversified menu and by contracting for our key commodities for extended periods of time whenever feasible and possible, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this respect due to the many factors that are outside of our control. In addition, raw materials that we may purchase on the international market are subject to fluctuations in both the value of the U.S. dollar, government regulated tariffs and increases in local demand, which may increase our costs and negatively impact our profitability.\nWe and our major independent third party brewing partners purchase a substantial portion of brewing raw materials and products, primarily malt and hops, from a limited number of domestic and foreign suppliers. We purchase a majority of our malts from a single supplier with multiple sources of malts. We generally enter into one-year purchase commitments with our malt and hops suppliers, based on the projected future volumes and brewing needs. We are exposed to the quality of the barley crop each year, and significant failure of a crop may adversely affect our beer costs. The quality and availability of the hops may be materially adversely affected by factors such as adverse weather and changes in currency exchange rates, resulting in increased prices. Hops and malt are agricultural products and, therefore, many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating out of hops or barley to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, may affect both price and supply.\nWe may be subject to increased labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur restaurant operations are subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal, state and local minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Over the last several years, low unemployment, new restaurant growth, competition and state minimum wage increases have resulted in unprecedented wage pressure in the restaurant industry for managers and hourly employees. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates could also increase our labor costs. The increased operating costs from wage increases could adversely affect our results of operations, especially if we are to effectively implement price increases to offset such additional costs.\nAny inability or failure of distributors or suppliers to provide food and beverages to us in a timely fashion may adversely affect our reputation, customer patronage, revenues and results of operations.\nWe currently depend on national and regional food distribution service companies, as well as other food manufacturers and suppliers, to provide food and beverage products to all of our restaurants. We also rely on independent third party brewers and many local beer distributors to provide us with beer for our restaurants. The operations of our distributors, suppliers and independent third party brewers are subject to risks including labor disputes, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that may limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products. Additionally, under the \u201cforce majeure\u201d provisions in most of our agreements with suppliers, certain unexpected and disruptive events may excuse a supplier from performing. If our distributors, suppliers and independent third party brewers cease doing business with us, or cannot make a scheduled delivery to us, or are unable to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or experience other issues such as adverse effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience short-term product supply shortages in some or all of our restaurants and may be required to purchase food, beer and beverage products from alternate suppliers at higher prices. We may also be forced to temporarily remove popular items from the menu offering of our restaurants. If alternative suppliers cannot meet our current product specifications, the consistency and quality of our food and beverage offerings, and thus our reputation, customer patronage, revenues and results of operations, may be adversely affected.\nAny inability of us to secure or maintain third party beer distribution arrangements may adversely affect our operating results.\nPursuant to various laws and regulations, the majority of our proprietary craft beer must be distributed to our restaurants through independent wholesale beer distributors, whether we produce the beer or it is produced by independent third party brewers. Although we currently have arrangements with a sufficient number of beer distributors in all markets where we operate restaurants, our continued national expansion will require us to enter into agreements with additional beer distributors. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain or secure additional beer distributors on terms favorable to us. Changes in control or ownership of the participants in our current beer distribution network may lead to less willingness on the part of certain distributors to carry our proprietary craft beer. Our beer distribution agreements are generally terminable by the distributor on short notice. Our ability to maintain our existing beer distribution agreements may also be adversely affected by the fact that many of our distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large percentage of their revenue and, therefore, they may be influenced by such producers. If our existing beer distribution agreements are terminated, we may not\nbe able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms or it may take some time to enter into a replacement agreement, which may result in an increase in the delivered cost of beer to our restaurants.\nAny inability of our internal or independent third party brewers to timely supply our beer may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur proprietary craft beer is a key factor in the success of our business. Each year, our brewing operations department forecasts our annual beer requirements based on our current restaurant requirements and expansion plans and determines our brewing production. Additionally, in certain states we are either legally required or choose to arrange for independent third party brewers to brew our beer using our proprietary recipes. If the independent third party brewers cease doing business with us, or cannot make a scheduled delivery to us because of a supply chain or production disruption or other issues, or if we cannot otherwise satisfy our internal brewing requirements, we may experience short-term supply shortages in some or all of our restaurants which may result in a loss of revenue. Potential disruptions include labor issues, governmental and regulatory actions, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures or operational shut downs. Additionally, if these independent third party brewers cease doing business with us, we may be required to purchase or brew our own beer at higher costs to us, or we may not be able to sell our proprietary craft beer at all, until we are able to secure an alternative supply source. If the independent third party brewers fail to adhere to our proprietary recipe and brewing specifications, the consistency and quality of beer offerings, and thus our reputation, customer patronage, revenues and results of operations, may be adversely affected. Additionally, financial stability of those brewing operations where we currently contract for our proprietary craft beer production, as well as their ability or willingness to continue to meet our beer production requirements, continues to be a significant risk in our business model. Accordingly, there can be no guarantees that our proprietary brewing requirements will continue to be met in the future.\nFrom time to time, we or the independent third party brewers and manufacturers may also experience shortages of kegs necessary to distribute our craft beer. We distribute our craft beer in kegs that are currently owned by us; however, in the past we have also leased them from third party vendors and we are responsible for providing kegs to the independent third party brewers that produce our proprietary craft beer.\nAny adverse weather conditions, seasonal fluctuations, natural disasters and effects of climate change may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, freezing weather or earthquakes (particularly in California where our centralized operating systems and Restaurant Support Center administrative personnel are located) may unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, climate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather-related events and conditions, such as drought and forest fires. Any of the foregoing events may result in physical damage, temporary or permanent closure, lack of an adequate work force, or temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of food, beverages, electric, water, sewer and waste disposal services necessary for our restaurants or Restaurant Support Center to operate.\nWe have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, including back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nOur corporate office is located in California and a significant number of our restaurants are located in California, Texas and Florida which makes us particularly sensitive to economic, regulatory, weather and other risk factors and conditions that are more prevalent in those states.\nOur corporate office is located in California and a significant number of our restaurants are concentrated in California, Texas and Florida. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Many states and municipalities in which our restaurants are located may experience severe revenue and budget shortfalls. Additionally, changes in state and municipal-level regulatory requirements, such as increases to the minimum wage rate, income taxes, unemployment insurance, as well as other taxes, mandatory healthcare coverage or paid leave where we operate or may desire to operate restaurants, may adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, we believe that California is subject to a greater risk for earthquakes, fires, water shortages, energy fluctuations and other natural and man-made disasters than most other states.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially disrupted and is expected to continue to materially disrupt for an extended period of time our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted our industry and had a material adverse effect on our business. Local governmental restrictions have limited our ability to operate our restaurants and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, consumers to avoid or limit gatherings in public places or social interactions, which could continue to adversely affect our business. The impact of any health pandemic on us might be disproportionately greater than on other casual dining concepts that have lower customer traffic and that depend less on the gathering of people.\nIn addition, our ability to maintain our supply chain and labor force may become challenging as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the restrictions placed on our operations, we may temporarily close more restaurants or dining rooms until local restrictions are lifted. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or when unrestricted operations will return, the negative impact is expected to continue to be material to our financial results, condition and prospects based on its longevity and severity.\nWe cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last or if it will reoccur even after vaccines are widely available, whether or when government restrictions will be imposed or lifted, or how quickly, if at all, customer traffic will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result, we are unable to predict how long our results of operations and financial performance will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Data Security and Technology\nWe rely heavily upon information technology and related data security systems, including credit card processing and our loyalty and employee engagement programs, and any failure or interruption of these systems, including those operated by third parties, may adversely affect our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely heavily on electronic information systems in all aspects of our operations, including (but not limited to) point-of-sale transaction processing in our restaurants; credit card processing; efficient operation of our restaurant kitchens; management of our inventories and overall supply chain; collection of cash; payment of payroll and other obligations; and, various other processes and procedures including our customer loyalty and employee engagement programs. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our in-house information systems and those technology services and systems that we contract for from third parties. Although we and our third party providers have operational safeguards in place, these safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of any of our or third party systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Our electronic information systems, including our back-up systems, and those of our third party providers, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, cyber-attacks, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption. If any of the critical IT systems on which we rely were to become unreliable, unavailable, compromised or otherwise fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our reputation as a brand or as an employer.\nOur business may be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents which result in unauthorized access, theft, modification or destruction of confidential information that is stored in our systems or by third parties on our behalf, including confidential business, employee, or customer data.\nCybersecurity incidents or other unauthorized access to systems may result in disruption to our operations, corruption or theft of critical data, confidential information or intellectual property. As reliance on technology continues to grow and more business activities have shifted online (including as a result of COVID-19), the risk associated with any cybersecurity incidents have grown. While we, and our third party vendors, have implemented security systems and infrastructure to prevent, detect, and/or mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to technology systems or platforms, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. Any cybersecurity or similar incident involving confidential information of our business, customers or employees could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, a loss of revenues, disruption of our business, litigation and regulatory actions. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems, infringements, misappropriations or other third party claims.\nRisk Related to Regulations and Legal Proceedings\nFederal, state and local beer, liquor and food service regulations and any violations thereof may adversely affect our\nrevenues and results of operations.\nWe are required to operate in compliance with federal laws and regulations relating to alcoholic beverages administered by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, as well as the laws and licensing requirements for alcoholic beverages of states and municipalities where our restaurants are or will be located. In addition, each restaurant must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with federal, state or local regulations may cause our licenses to be revoked and force us to cease the brewing or sale of alcoholic beverages, or both, or the serving of food at our restaurants. Additionally, state liquor laws may prevent or impede the expansion of our restaurants into certain markets. The liquor laws of certain states prevent us from selling the beer brewed at our restaurants. Any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits or approvals may delay or prevent the opening of a restaurant in a particular area or increase the costs associated therewith. If we are unable to obtain or maintain our existing licenses, our customer patronage, revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Or, if we choose to open a restaurant in those states where the number of available licenses is limited, the cost of a new license may be significant.\nBrewing operations require various federal, state, and local licenses, permits and approvals. Our restaurants and on-site brewpubs operate pursuant to exceptions to the \u201ctied house\u201d laws, which created the \u201cthree tier system\u201d of liquor distribution. These \u201ctied house\u201d laws generally prohibit brewers from holding retail licenses and prohibit vertical integration in ownership and control among the three tiers. Brewing restaurants and brewpubs operate under exceptions to these general prohibitions. Generally, our brewing restaurants are licensed as retailers with limited privileges to brew beer on the restaurant premises, and we do not have the same privileges as a microbrewery. Other restrictions imposed by law may prevent us from operating both brewing restaurants and non-brewing restaurants in some states. We are at risk that a state\u2019s regulations concerning brewing restaurants or the interpretation of these regulations may change. Because of the many and various state and federal licensing and permitting requirements, there is a significant risk that one or more regulatory agencies may determine that we have not complied with applicable licensing or permitting regulations or have not maintained the approvals necessary for us to conduct business within its jurisdiction. Even after the issuance of our licenses, our operations may be subject to differing interpretations of the \u201ctied house\u201d laws and the requirements of the \u201cthree tier system\u201d of liquor distribution in any jurisdiction that we conduct business. Any such changes in interpretation may adversely impact our current model of brewing beer or supplying beer, or both, to our restaurants in that state, and may also cause us to lose, either temporarily or permanently, the licenses, permits and registrations necessary to conduct our restaurant operations, and subject us to fines and penalties.\nThe manufacture, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages is highly regulated and taxed under federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our operations are subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by federal, state, and local governmental entities than are those of non-alcohol related beverage businesses. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations may result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals. The loss or revocation of any existing licenses, permits or approvals, and/or the failure to obtain any required additional or new licenses, permits, or approvals may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nIncreasing the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages, or certain types of alcoholic beverages, is frequently proposed in various jurisdictions either to increase revenues or discourage purchase by underage drinkers. If adopted, these measures may affect some or all of our proprietary craft beer products. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for beer, thus negatively impacting sales of our beer. Some states have also been reviewing the state tax treatment for flavored malt beverages which may result in increased costs for us, as well as decreased sales.\nCompliance with cybersecurity, privacy and similar laws may involve significant costs and any failure to comply could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches also could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. In addition, the California Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCPA\u201d), which became effective in 2020, provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and the right for consumers to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions). Compliance with the CPA and other current and future privacy, cybersecurity and related laws may be involve significant costs. If we fail to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party\u2019s information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under the CPA or any similar laws adopted in other states, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws, government regulation, and other legal requirements and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur business is subject to large number of federal, state, and laws and regulations, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nthe production, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022\nemployment practices and working conditions, including, among others, minimum wage and other wage and benefit requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, predictive scheduling, paid leave requirements, work eligibility requirements, employee classification as exempt/non-exempt for overtime and other purposes, immigration status, workplace safety, discrimination, and harassment;\n\u2022\npublic accommodations and safety conditions, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations, and other areas;\n\u2022\nenvironmental matters, such as emissions and air quality, water consumption, and the discharge, storage, handling, release, and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances;\n\u2022\npreparation, sale and labeling of food, including regulations of the Food and Drug Administration, including those relating to inspections and food recalls, menu labeling and nutritional content;\n\u2022\ndata privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information, and payment card industry standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nbuilding and zoning requirements, including state and local licensing and regulation governing the design and operation of facilities and land use,\n\u2022\nhealth, sanitation, safety and fire standards; and\n\u2022\npublic company compliance, disclosure and governance matters, including accounting regulations, SEC and NASDAQ disclosure requirements.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations, and future new laws or changes in these laws or regulations that impose additional requirements, can be costly. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nWe may become party to legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class or collective actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; customer discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; violation of \u201cdram-shop\u201d laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party); trademark or patent infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer acceptance of our brands, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. Litigation may impact our operations in other ways as well. Allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, may adversely affect employee acquisition and retention. Also, some employment related claims in the area of wage and hour disputes are not insurable risks. We also are subject to claims and disputes from landlords under our leases, which may lead to litigation or a threatened or actual lease termination. Litigation of any nature may be expensive to defend, may adversely affect our reputation and the reputation of our restaurants, and may divert money and management\u2019s attention from our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAny inability to access sources of capital and/or to raise capital in the future on favorable terms may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully grow our business depends, in part, on the availability of adequate capital to finance the development of additional new restaurants and other growth related expenses. Changes in our operating plans, acceleration of our expansion plans, a decision to acquire another restaurant concept, reinstitution of our share repurchase program or\ndividends, lower than anticipated revenues, continuation of the business interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other unanticipated and/or uncontrollable events in our industry that impact our liquidity, lower than anticipated tenant improvement allowances offered by landlords, increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis. There can be no guarantee that additional financing will be readily available or available on favorable terms, or it all, especially the longer the COVID-19 pandemic lasts. The unavailability of financing when needed may adversely affect our growth and other plans, as well as our financial condition. Even if available, additional financing may involve significant cash payment obligations, covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business, and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, as it has during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our shareholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them. Those fluctuations may be based on various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in comparable restaurant sales or operating results, whether in our operations or in those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or opinions by research analysts, either with respect to us or other casual dining companies;\n\u2022\nany failure to meet investor or analyst expectations, particularly with respect to total restaurant operating weeks, number of restaurant openings, comparable restaurant sales, average weekly sales per restaurant, total revenues, operating margins and net income per share;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in domestic or worldwide economic, political or market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the consumer spending environment;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in the shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales or issuances by us, our directors or executive officers and our significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nour dividend policy;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other restaurant companies;\n\u2022\nactions by shareholders, including actions of activist investors or unsolicited takeover proposals;\n\u2022\nvarious market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, involving us, our suppliers and distributors, whether accurate or not;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new locations, menu items, technological advances, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of a key member of management; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the costs or availability of key inputs to our operations.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that an active trading market for our common stock will continue which may affect our stock price and the liquidity of any investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84062, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BJRI"}
