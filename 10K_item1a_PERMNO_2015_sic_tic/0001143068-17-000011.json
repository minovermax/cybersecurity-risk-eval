{"cik": "1143068", "company": "GREAT PLAINS ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nActual results in future periods for Great Plains Energy and KCP&L could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Companies' business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the Companies' management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Companies. This information, as well as the other information included in this report and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be carefully considered before making an investment in the securities of Great Plains Energy or KCP&L. Risk factors of KCP&L are also risk factors of Great Plains Energy.\nRisks Relating to the Anticipated Acquisition of Westar:\nThe ability of Great Plains Energy and Westar to complete the merger is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect Great Plains Energy or cause the merger to be abandoned.\nTo complete the merger, each of Great Plains Energy and Westar must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nGreat Plains Energy and Westar have not yet obtained all of the regulatory consents and approvals required to complete the merger. Governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the merger. Great Plains Energy and Westar will be unable to complete the merger until the necessary consents and approvals are received from FERC, the NRC, KCC, and the MPSC (collectively referred to as the required governmental approvals). The Merger Agreement may require Great Plains Energy and/or Westar to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company. If the required governmental approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, then neither Great Plains Energy nor Westar will be obligated to complete the merger.\nIn addition, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger, including after closing, as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. In some jurisdictions, a private party could initiate an action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger, before or after it is completed. Great Plains Energy or Westar may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nFERC Commissioner Norman Bay's resignation, effective February 3, 2017, left FERC with two sitting commissioners and the inability to convene a quorum. Without a quorum, FERC cannot issue certain orders on contested cases, including Great Plains Energy's and Westar's merger application. If a replacement commissioner is not appointed and confirmed in a timely fashion, the closing of the merger could be delayed until such time that a replacement commissioner is approved by the Senate.\nThe September 2016 special meetings at which the Great Plains Energy shareholders and the Westar shareholders approved the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have taken place before all required approvals have been obtained and, in certain cases, before the terms of any conditions to obtain such required approvals are known. As a result, Great Plains Energy and Westar may make decisions after the special meetings to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further shareholder approval. Such actions could have an adverse effect on the combined company.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement contains other customary conditions to the closing of the merger, each of which must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the merger.\nIf Great Plains Energy and Westar are unable to complete the merger, Great Plains Energy would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nGreat Plains Energy would not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including, among other things, increased operating efficiencies and future cost savings;\n\u2022\nthe attention of management of Great Plains Energy may have been diverted to the merger rather than to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Company;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company; and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock may decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\nGreat Plains Energy will be required to pay Westar a termination fee of $380 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to receive the required governmental approvals or a failure to receive them on terms and conditions that would not result in a material adverse effect on Great Plains Energy and its subsidiaries, after giving effect to the merger.\nWe can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the required governmental approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on Great Plains Energy's results of operations and the trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Great Plains Energy's or Westar's ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either Great Plains Energy or Westar from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Westar or Great Plains Energy to pay a termination fee to the other party.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Westar and Great Plains Energy each are restricted from entering into alternative merger or acquisition transactions. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, each party is restricted from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging, inducing or facilitating, or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or cooperating in any way with any person with respect to, any alternative proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative proposal. Under certain circumstances either Westar or Great Plains Energy may be required to pay a termination fee to the other if they were to enter into an alternative transaction within twelve months of a termination of the Merger Agreement. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Westar or Great Plains Energy from considering or proposing that acquisition, including under circumstances in which the Merger Agreement would be terminated on a separate basis, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger. As a result of these restrictions, neither Westar nor Great Plains Energy may be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liability to the other.\nGreat Plains Energy and Westar will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, or customers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Great Plains Energy and Westar. Although Great Plains Energy and Westar intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair the ability of Great Plains Energy or Westar to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Great Plains Energy or Westar to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with Great Plains Energy or Westar or not enter into new relationships or transactions.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite Great Plains Energy's and Westar's retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment with either company because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Great Plains Energy's and/or Westar's financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, the combined company's operational and financial performance following the merger could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain key employees and skilled workers of Great Plains Energy and Westar. The loss of the services of key employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge regarding Great Plains Energy's and Westar's businesses could adversely affect the combined company's future operating results and the successful ongoing operation of its businesses.\nFailure to successfully combine the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company, and, consequently, the value of Great Plains Energy common stock.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Great Plains Energy to realize the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from combining the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined. If the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully or at all. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger. These integration difficulties could result in a decline in the market value of Great Plains Energy common stock.\nFailure to complete the merger, or significant delays in completing the merger, could negatively affect the trading prices of Great Plains Energy common stock and the future business and financial results of Great Plains Energy.\nCompletion of the merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risk that approval of the merger by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. If the merger is not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the merger, it could negatively affect the trading price of Great Plains Energy common stock and the future business and financial results of Great Plains Energy. Great Plains Energy also will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nGreat Plains Energy may be liable for damages to Westar under the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of Great Plains Energy common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nhaving to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of Great Plains Energy will have been diverted to the merger rather than Great Plains Energy's own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Great Plains Energy.\nEach of Great Plains Energy and Westar will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.\nGreat Plains Energy and Westar have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Great Plains Energy and Westar. Although Great Plains Energy and Westar expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nGreat Plains Energy may be unable to obtain the anticipated combination of financing or the necessary amount of financing to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration.\nGreat Plains Energy intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration with a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds from the issuance of a combination of common stock, mandatory convertible preferred stock and debt securities. In October 2016, Great Plains Energy completed registered public offerings of 60.5 million shares of common stock for total net proceeds of $1.55 billion and 17.3 million depositary shares each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Great Plains Energy's 7.00% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) for total net proceeds of $836.2 million.\nTo the extent the proceeds from Great Plains Energy's remaining expected securities issuances are not available on or before the closing date of the merger, or are in insufficient amounts, Great Plains Energy may use borrowings under its bridge term loan facility to fund the remaining portion of the cash consideration for the merger. However, the availability of funds under the bridge term loan facility is subject to certain conditions including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Westar and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties and the absence of certain defaults with respect to indebtedness of Great Plains Energy and its subsidiaries.\nIf Great Plains Energy is required to obtain more debt financing than anticipated, whether through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings under the bridge term loan facility, the required regulatory approvals to complete the merger may be more difficult to obtain and the combined company's credit ratings and ability to service its debt could be adversely affected.\nCurrent Great Plains Energy shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.\nGreat Plains Energy has already issued approximately 60.5 million shares of common stock in order to raise proceeds to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the merger. Furthermore, Great Plains Energy issued in October 2016 and also expects to issue at the time of the merger, shares of mandatorily convertible preferred stock, which shall ultimately convert into common stock. In connection with the completion of the merger, Great Plains Energy will also issue up to approximately 45 million shares of Great Plains Energy common stock to Westar shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nGreat Plains Energy shareholders currently have the right to vote for the Company's board of directors and on other matters affecting Great Plains Energy. When the merger occurs, each Westar shareholder that receives shares of Great Plains Energy common stock will become a shareholder of Great Plains Energy with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is significantly smaller than the shareholder's percentage ownership in Westar. Correspondingly, each Great Plains Energy shareholder will remain a shareholder of Great Plains Energy with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the shareholder's percentage ownership of Great Plains Energy prior to the merger.\nAs a result of these securities issuances and reduced ownership percentages, current Great Plains Energy shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have with respect to Great Plains Energy.\nThe market price of Great Plains Energy common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of Great Plains Energy or Westar currently.\nUpon completion of the merger, the businesses of the combined company will differ from those of Great Plains Energy and Westar prior to the merger in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Great Plains Energy's shares of common stock following the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of Great Plains Energy and Westar.\nThere are risks associated with the mandatory convertible preferred stock Great Plains Energy expects to issue pursuant to its stock purchase agreement with OMERS to finance a portion of the merger consideration.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy entered into a stock purchase agreement with OCM Credit Portfolio LP (OMERS) pursuant to which Great Plains Energy will issue and sell to OMERS $750 million of 7.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (Series A Preferred Stock) upon the consummation of the merger. Upon entering into the stock purchase agreement, Great Plains Energy paid OMERS $15 million, which is not refundable in the event the merger is not consummated. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock will provide that if Great Plains Energy misses two quarterly dividend payments, Great Plains Energy would be required to appoint two representatives designated by OMERS to the Great Plains Energy Board. In addition, OMERS' non-U.S. based ownership could potentially complicate obtaining the required regulatory approvals for the merger.\nThe combined company's indebtedness following the merger will be greater than Great Plains Energy's existing indebtedness. As a result, it may be more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts or take other actions, and the combined company may need to divert its cash flow from operations to debt service payments.\nIn connection with the merger, Great Plains Energy will incur additional debt to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration and transaction expenses and the indebtedness of the combined company will include Westar's outstanding debt. The combined company's debt service obligations with respect to this increased indebtedness could have an adverse impact on its earnings and cash flows, which after the merger would include the earnings and cash flows of Westar, for as long as the indebtedness is outstanding.\nThe combined company's increased indebtedness could also have important consequences to holders of Great Plains Energy securities. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any decrease in revenues could cause the combined company to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make its scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022\nlimit the combined company's flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates and, consequently, place the combined company at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors with less debt;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of the combined company's cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nresult in a downgrade in the rating of the combined company's indebtedness, which could limit its ability to borrow additional funds or increase the interest rates applicable to its indebtedness (after the announcement of the merger, Moody's Investors Service placed its long-term ratings of Great Plains Energy on review for downgrade and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised the outlook of Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO from stable to negative);\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since some of Great Plains Energy's borrowings are, and will continue to be, at variable rates of interest; or\n\u2022\nrequire that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on Great Plains Energy.\nBased upon current levels of operations, Great Plains Energy expects to be able to generate sufficient cash on a consolidated basis to make all of the principal and interest payments when such payments are due under Great Plains Energy's and its current subsidiaries' existing credit facilities, indentures and other instruments governing their outstanding indebtedness, and under the indebtedness of Westar and its subsidiaries that may remain outstanding after the merger; but there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to repay or refinance such borrowings and obligations.\nGreat Plains Energy is committed to maintaining its credit ratings. In order to maintain these credit ratings, Great Plains Energy may consider it appropriate to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding following the merger. This may be accomplished in several ways, including issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, reducing discretionary uses of cash or a combination of these and other measures. Issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock would have the effect of diluting the ownership percentage that current Great Plains Energy shareholders and former Westar shareholders hold in the combined company and might reduce the reported earnings per share. Any potential issuances could be adversely impacted by movements in the overall equity markets or the utility sector of the market and ultimately impact any offering price. The specific measures that Great Plains Energy may ultimately decide to use to maintain or improve its credit ratings and their timing will depend upon a number of factors, including market conditions and forecasts at the time those decisions are made.\nThe combined company will record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect the combined company's operating results.\nThe merger will be accounted for as an acquisition by Great Plains Energy in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Westar will be recorded, as of completion, at their respective fair values and added to those of Great Plains Energy. The reported financial condition and results of operations of Great Plains Energy issued after completion of the merger will reflect Westar balances and results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Westar for periods prior to the merger.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to Westar's tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger. The fair value of Westar's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to the rate setting practices of their regulators approximate their carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. Great Plains Energy expects that the merger will result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, the combined company may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on the combined company's operating results.\nThe anticipated benefits of combining Great Plains Energy and Westar may not be realized.\nGreat Plains Energy and Westar entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, increased operating efficiencies. Although Great Plains Energy and Westar expect to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, achieving them is subject to a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nwhether United States federal and state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities whose approval is required to complete the merger impose conditions on the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the combined company, including its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the two companies to combine certain of their operations or take advantage of expected growth opportunities;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ngeneral competitive factors in the marketplace; and\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs required to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nNo assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or, if achieved, the timing of their achievement. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and decreases in the amount of expected revenues or net income of the combined company.\nThe merger may not be accretive to earnings and may cause dilution to Great Plains Energy's earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Great Plains Energy common stock.\nGreat Plains Energy currently anticipates that the merger will be neutral to Great Plains Energy's forecasted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis in the first full calendar year after closing increasing to approximately a 10 percent accretion in the third full calendar year after closing. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. Great Plains Energy may encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Great Plains Energy's earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Great Plains Energy's common stock.\nThe merger will combine two companies that are currently affected by developments in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation and increased competition. A failure to adapt to the changing regulatory environment after the merger could adversely affect the stability of the combined company's earnings and could result in the erosion of its market positions, revenues and profits.\nBecause Great Plains Energy, Westar and their respective subsidiaries are regulated in the U.S. at the federal level and in several states, the two companies have been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. After the merger, the combined company and/or its subsidiaries will be subject in the U.S. to extensive federal regulation as well as to state regulation in Missouri and Kansas. Each of these jurisdictions has implemented, is in the process of implementing or possibly will implement changes to the regulatory and legislative framework applicable to the electric utility industry. These changes could have a material adverse effect on the combined company.\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on the combined company. Moreover, potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or otherwise may create greater risks to the stability of utility earnings generally. If the combined company is not responsive to these changes, it could suffer erosion in market position, revenues and profits as competitors gain access to the service territories of its utility subsidiaries.\nThe market value of Great Plains Energy common stock could decline if large amounts of its common stock are sold in anticipation of or following the merger.\nFollowing the merger, shareholders of Great Plains Energy and former shareholders of Westar will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current shareholders of Great Plains Energy and Westar may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which Great Plains Energy or Westar common stock is or was included. If, before or following the merger, large amounts of Great Plains Energy common stock are sold, the price of its common stock could decline.\nUtility Regulatory Risks:\nComplex utility regulation could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation, including regulation by the MPSC, KCC, FERC, NRC, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and SPP. The Companies must address in their business planning and management of operations the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators and taxing authorities. Failure of the Companies to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner, new or changed laws, regulations, standards, interpretations or other legal requirements, deterioration of the Companies' relationship with regulators and increased compliance costs and potential non-compliance consequences may materially affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, regulators may impose burdensome restrictions and conditions on the\nCompanies' transactions and ventures, rendering them less attractive from a financial or operational perspective. Certain of these risks are addressed in greater detail below.\nThe outcome of retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on the business and is largely outside the Companies' control.\nThe rates that KCP&L and GMO are allowed to charge their customers significantly influence the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These rates are subject to the determination, in large part, of governmental entities outside of the Companies' control, including the MPSC, KCC and FERC.\nThe utility rate-setting principle generally applicable to KCP&L and GMO is that rates should provide a reasonable opportunity to recover expenses and investments prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on such investments. Various expenses incurred by KCP&L and GMO have been excluded from rates by the MPSC and KCC in past rate cases as not being prudently incurred or not providing utility customer benefit, and there is a risk that certain expenses incurred in the future may not be recovered in rates. Third-parties often intervene in the utilities' rate cases and argue that certain costs have not been prudently incurred or are otherwise not recoverable in rates. The MPSC and KCC also have in the past and may in the future exclude from rates all or a portion of investments in various facilities as not being prudently incurred or not being useful in providing utility service.\nAs discussed in the \"Environmental Risks\" and \"Financial Risks\" sections below, the Companies' capital expenditures are expected to be substantial over the next several years and there is a risk that a portion of the capital costs could be excluded from rates in future rate cases.\nThe Companies are also exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls due to the inherent \"regulatory lag\" in the rate-setting process, especially during periods of significant cost inflation or declining retail usage, as KCP&L's and GMO's utility rates are generally based on historical information and are not subject to adjustment between rate cases, other than principally for fuel, purchased power, transmission and property taxes for KCP&L in Kansas; fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs and demand-side investments for KCP&L in Missouri; and fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs, demand-side investments and renewable energy (solar rebates) for GMO. These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs, failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nFailure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects, the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances, regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings, reduced access to capital markets, increased financing costs, lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements, or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures. In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception (including, but not limited to, the Companies' environmental reputation) and regulatory pressures, the Companies may be subject to rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, including phase-in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers.\nRegulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose the Companies to compliance penalties or adverse rate consequences.\nThe FERC, NERC and SPP have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities, including KCP&L and GMO. The MPSC and KCC have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements, such as vegetation management standards, facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards. In addition, the Companies are also subject to health, safety and other requirements enacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other federal and state agencies. As discussed more fully under \"Operational Risks,\" the NRC extensively regulates nuclear power plants, including Wolf Creek. The costs of existing, new or modified regulations, standards and other requirements could have an adverse\neffect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows as a result of increased operations or maintenance and capital expenditures for new facilities or to repair or improve existing facilities. In addition, failure to meet quality of service, reliability, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, operational or other standards and requirements could expose the Companies to penalties, additional compliance costs, or adverse rate consequences.\nTax Reform Risk:\nChanges in federal income tax policy could negatively impact the Companies.\nThe Companies are impacted by the U.S. federal income tax policy, including corporate income tax laws. Both the new federal administration and the Republicans in the House of Representatives have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes in the U.S. corporate income tax laws. These proposed changes include, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the immediate deductibility of 100% of capital expenditures, and the elimination of the interest expense deduction. The Companies are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on the Companies. However, it is possible that changes in the U.S. federal income tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Risks:\nThe Companies are subject to current and potential environmental requirements and the incurrence of environmental liabilities, any or all of which may adversely affect their business and financial results.\nThe Companies are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and disposal, natural resources and health and safety. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and remediation costs for historical and pre-existing conditions, these laws, regulations and permits authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. There is also a risk that new environmental laws and regulations, new administrative or judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, or the requirements in new or renewed environmental permits could adversely affect the Companies' operations. In addition, there is also a risk of lawsuits brought by third parties alleging violations of environmental commitments or requirements, claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters, and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other damages. Certain federal courts have held that state and local governments and private parties have standing to bring climate change tort suits seeking company-specific emission reductions and damages.\nEnvironmental permits are subject to periodic renewal, which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits. New facilities, or modifications of existing facilities, may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits. Delays in the environmental permitting process, public opposition and challenges, denials of permit applications, limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects, and thus materially adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nKCP&L and GMO periodically seek recovery of capital costs and expenses for environmental compliance and remediation through rate increases; however, there can be no assurance that recovery of these costs would be granted. KCP&L and GMO may be subject to material adverse rate treatment in response to competitive, economic, political, legislative or regulatory pressures and/or public perception of the Companies' environmental reputation. The costs of compliance or noncompliance with environmental requirements, remediation costs, adverse outcomes of lawsuits, or failure to timely recover environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed in more detail below. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding certain significant environmental matters and Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's current estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations.\nAir and Climate Change\nThe Companies' current generation capacity is primarily coal-fired, and is estimated to produce about one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) per MWh, or approximately 19 million tons and 15 million tons of CO2 per year for Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, respectively. Management believes it is possible that additional federal or relevant state or local laws or regulations could be enacted to address global climate change. At the international level, in December 2015 the Paris Agreement was adopted by nearly 200 countries and became effective in November 2016 as the threshold of at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have joined it through ratification. The Paris Agreement does not result in any new, legally binding obligations on the United States to meet a particular greenhouse gas emissions target, but establishes a framework for international cooperation on climate change. Other international agreements legally binding on the United States may be reached in the future. Such new laws, regulations or treaties could mandate new or increased requirements to control or reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, which are created in the combustion of fossil fuels. These requirements could include, among other things, taxes or fees on fossil fuels or emissions, cap and trade programs, emission limits and clean or renewable energy standards.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has enacted various regulations regarding the reporting and permitting of greenhouse gases and has proposed other regulations under the existing Clean Air Act. The EPA has established thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions, defining when Clean Air Act permits under the New Source Performance Standards, New Source Review and Title V operating permits programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities and when the installation of best available control technology would be required. In August 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan which sets CO2 emission performance rates for existing affected fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA translated those performance rates into a state goal measured in mass and rate based on each state\u2019s generation mix. The states have the ability to develop their own plans for affected units to achieve either the performance rates directly or the state goals, with guidelines for the development, submittal and implementation of those plans. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan putting the rule on hold pending review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and any subsequent review by the U.S. Supreme Court if such review is sought. Compliance with the Clean Power Plan has the potential of having significant financial and operational impacts on Great Plains Energy and KCP&L; however, the ultimate financial and operational consequences to Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot be determined until the outcome of pending litigation is known and/or the state plans to implement the Clean Power Plan are known. Additional federal and/or state legislation or regulation respecting greenhouse gas emissions may be proposed or enacted in the future. Requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may cause the Companies to incur significant costs relating to their ongoing operations (such as for additional environmental control equipment, retiring and replacing existing generation, re-powering existing plants to utilize alternative fuel or selecting more costly generation alternatives), to procure emission allowance credits, or due to the imposition of taxes, fees or other governmental charges as a result of such emissions.\nWater\nThe Clean Water Act and associated regulations enacted by the EPA form a comprehensive program to restore and preserve water quality. All of the Companies' generating facilities, and certain of their other facilities, are subject to the Clean Water Act.\nIn May 2014, the EPA finalized regulations regarding protection of aquatic life from being killed or injured by cooling water intake structures. KCP&L\u2019s generation facilities with cooling water intake structures are subject to the best technology available standards based on studies completed to comply with such standards. The rule provides flexibility to work with the states to develop the best technology available to minimize aquatic species impacted by being pinned against intake screens or drawn into cooling water systems.\nKCP&L holds a permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) covering water discharge from its Hawthorn Station. The permit authorizes KCP&L to, among other things, withdraw\nwater from the Missouri River for cooling purposes and return the heated water to the Missouri River. KCP&L has applied for a renewal of this permit and the EPA has submitted an interim objection letter regarding the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water. Until this matter is resolved, KCP&L continues to operate under its current permit. Future water permit renewals at KCP&L's Iatan Station and at GMO's Sibley and Lake Road Stations could also be impacted by the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot predict the outcome of these matters; however, while less significant outcomes are possible, these matters may require a reduction in generation, installation of cooling towers or other technology to cool the water, or both, any of which could have a significant impact on Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the EPA finalized a revision of the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards regulation to make the existing controls on discharges from steam electric power plants more stringent. The final rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The new requirements for existing power plants would be phased in between 2018 and 2023.\nFurther, the possible effects of climate change, including potentially increased temperatures and reduced precipitation, could make it more difficult and costly to comply with the current and final permit requirements.\nSolid Waste\nSolid and hazardous waste generation, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal are regulated at the federal and state levels under various laws and regulations. In April 2015, the EPA published final regulations to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle D to address the risks from the disposal of CCRs generated from the combustion of coal at electric generating facilities. The Companies principally use coal in generating electricity and dispose of CCRs in both on-site facilities and facilities owned by third parties. Current and future EPA regulations regarding the handling, disposal and remediation of CCRs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRemediation\nUnder current law, the Companies are also generally responsible for any liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their properties and other properties at which the Companies arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, including properties that they have previously owned or operated, such as manufactured gas plants (MGP), regardless of whether they were responsible for the contamination or whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time they owned or operated the properties or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances.\nDue to all of the above, the Companies' projected capital and other expenditures for environmental compliance are subject to significant uncertainties, including the timing of implementation of any new or modified environmental requirements, the limits imposed by such requirements and the types and costs of the compliance alternatives selected by the Companies. As a result, costs to comply with environmental requirements cannot be estimated with certainty, and actual costs could be significantly higher than projections. New environmental laws and regulations affecting the operations of the Companies may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Companies or their facilities, any of which may materially adversely affect the Companies' business, adversely affect the Companies' ability to continue operating its power plants as currently done and substantially increase environmental expenditures or liabilities in the future.\nFinancial Risks:\nFinancial market disruptions and declines in credit ratings may increase financing costs and/or limit access to the credit markets, which may adversely affect liquidity and results.\nThe Companies' capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets, revolving credit facilities provided by financial institutions and long-term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. The Companies also rely on bank-provided credit facilities for credit support, such as letters of credit, to support operations. The amount of credit support required for operations varies and is impacted by a number of factors.\nGreat Plains Energy, KCP&L, GMO and certain of their securities are rated by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Following the announcement of the anticipated acquisition of Westar, Moody's Investors Service placed its long-term ratings on Great Plains Energy on review for downgrade and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised the outlook on Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO from stable to negative. These ratings impact the Companies' cost of funds and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. The interest rates on borrowings under the Companies' revolving credit agreements and on a portion of Great Plains Energy's debt are subject to increase as their respective credit ratings decrease. The amount of collateral or other credit support required under power supply and certain other agreements is also dependent on credit ratings.\nConditions in the United States capital and credit markets may deteriorate in the future for a variety of reasons, including, among others: instability in global markets, political uncertainty in the United States or abroad, fluctuations in the price of oil, geopolitical instability or other unforeseen events both in the United States and around the world. Adverse market conditions or decreases in Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's credit ratings could have material adverse effects on the Companies. These effects could include, among others: reduced access to capital and increased cost of funds; dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices; changes in the type and/or increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties; increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan funding requirements; rate case disallowance of KCP&L's or GMO's costs of capital; reductions in or delays of capital expenditures; or reductions in Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. Any of these results could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on the Companies' lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations.\nGreat Plains Energy has guaranteed some of GMO\u2019s long-term and short-term debt and payments under these guarantees may adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nGreat Plains Energy has issued guarantees covering $96.6 million of GMO's long-term debt. Great Plains Energy also guarantees GMO's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2016, GMO had $201.9 million of commercial paper outstanding. The guarantees obligate Great Plains Energy to pay amounts owed by GMO directly to the holders of the guaranteed debt in the event GMO defaults on its payment obligations. Great Plains Energy may also guarantee debt that GMO may issue in the future. Any guarantee payments could adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nThe inability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to Great Plains Energy, or the inability otherwise of Great Plains Energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect.\nGreat Plains Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, particularly KCP&L and GMO. The ability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, and accordingly, Great Plains Energy's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters.\nIn addition, Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends. Great Plains Energy's articles of incorporation restrict the payment of common stock dividends in the event common equity is 25% or less of total capitalization. In addition, if preferred stock dividends are not declared and paid when scheduled, Great Plains Energy could not declare or pay common stock dividends or purchase any common shares. If the unpaid preferred stock dividends are in arrears for six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive, the preferred shareholders will be entitled to name two directors to the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors. Furthermore, pursuant to settlement agreements with certain intervenors in Missouri that are pending MPSC approval with respect to the merger, Great Plains Energy agreed that in the event that KCP&L's or GMO's credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade as a result of the merger, then KCP&L and GMO would be restricted from paying a dividend to Great Plains Energy unless approved by the MPSC or until their credit ratings are restored to investment grade. Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the holding company structure require Great Plains Energy and KCP&L to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 30% and 35%, respectively, of total capitalization (including only the amount of short-term debt in excess of the amount of construction work in progress). Under the Federal Power Act, KCP&L and GMO generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. The revolving credit agreements of Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO and the note purchase agreement for GMO's Series A, B and C Senior Notes contain a covenant requiring each company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00, except as the ratio relates to Great Plains Energy, which was amended in June 2016. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Great Plains Energy's Board of Directors regularly evaluates the common stock dividend policy and determines an appropriate dividend each quarter, after taking into account such factors as, among other things, earnings, financial condition and cash flows from KCP&L and GMO, as well as general economic conditions. While the corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants discussed above are not expected to affect the Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future, Great Plains Energy cannot assure common shareholders that the dividend will be paid in the future or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past.\nMarket performance, increased retirements and retirement plan regulations could significantly impact retirement plan funding requirements and associated cash needs and expenses.\nSubstantially all of the Companies' and WCNOC's employees participate in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. Former employees also have accrued benefits in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. The costs of these plans depend on a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of the provided benefits, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, changes in laws or regulations, and the Companies' required or voluntary contributions to the plans. The Companies currently have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans. Also, if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels, or if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments, or if interest rates materially fall, the Companies' contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. In addition, changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, could have a significant impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform, or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nAs a service provider to GMO, KCP&L may have exposure to GMO's financial performance and operations.\nGMO has no employees of its own. KCP&L employees operate and manage GMO's properties, and KCP&L charges GMO for the cost of these services. These arrangements may pose risks to KCP&L, including possible\nclaims arising from actions of KCP&L employees in operating GMO's properties and providing other services to GMO. KCP&L's claims for reimbursement for services provided to GMO are unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of GMO. KCP&L's ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of GMO depends on the financial ability of GMO to make such payments.\nCustomer and Weather-Related Risks:\nThe results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies can be materially affected by changes in customer electricity consumption.\nChanges in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions, downturns or sluggishness in the economy, technological advances, energy efficiency or other factors may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nTechnological advances, energy efficiency, or other energy conservation measures could reduce customer electricity consumption. KCP&L and GMO generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce electricity, including microturbines, wind turbines, fuel cells and solar cells, that have recently become more cost competitive. If this trend continues, the Companies customer electricity consumption could be reduced. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which the Companies\u2019 customers purchase or use electricity, which could reduce the Companies customer electricity consumption.\nWeather is a major driver of the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L are significantly impacted by seasonality, with approximately one-third of their retail electric revenues recorded in the third quarter. Unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales. In addition, severe weather, including but not limited to tornados, snow, rain, flooding and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs. KCP&L's and GMO's rates may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these increased costs. Some of the Companies' generating stations utilize water from the Missouri River for cooling purposes. Low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations and, if these levels were to get low enough, could require modifications to plant operations. The possible effects of climate change (such as increased temperatures, increased occurrence of severe weather or reduced precipitation, among other possible results) could potentially increase the volatility of demand and prices for energy commodities, increase the frequency and impact of severe weather, increase the frequency of flooding or decrease water and flow levels. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase the Companies' cost in providing service.\nOperational Risks:\nOperational risks may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe operation of the Companies' electric generation, transmission, distribution and information systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, aging infrastructure, processes and personnel performance; problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages; limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental, safety or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; labor disputes; difficulties with the implementation or continued operation of information systems; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, droughts, explosions, terrorism, cyber threats, severe weather or other similar occurrences. Furthermore, to the extent that a cyber attack was successful, customer and employee information may be stolen, equipment may be destroyed or damaged and operations may be disrupted. Any such equipment or system outage or constraint can, among other things:\n\u2022\nin the case of generation equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, increase purchased power volumes and costs and reduce wholesale sales opportunities;\n\u2022\nin the case of transmission equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, require changes in the source of generation and affect wholesale sales opportunities and the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements;\n\u2022\nin the case of distribution systems, affect revenues and operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics and customer expectations; and\n\u2022\nin the case of information systems, affect the control and operations of generation, transmission, distribution, customer information and other business operations and processes, increase operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements and customer expectations.\nWith the exception of Hawthorn No. 5, which was substantially rebuilt in 2001, and Iatan No. 2, which was completed in 2010, all of KCP&L's and GMO's coal-fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to 1986. The age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages, reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense. Training, preventive maintenance and other programs have been implemented, but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of the Companies' generation facilities or increased maintenance expense. Furthermore, aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. The higher maintenance costs and capital expenditures for new replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for the Companies' customers, resistance by the Companies' regulators to allow customer rate increases and/or regulatory lag.\nThe Companies currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover their facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate. These policies, however, do not cover the Companies' transmission or distribution systems, and the cost of repairing damage to these systems may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of the Companies' facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage.\nThese and other operating events may reduce the Companies' revenues, increase their costs, or both, and may materially affect their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCyber attacks and other disruptions to facilities could interfere with operations, expose the Companies, customers or employees to a risk of loss and could cause reputational and financial harm.\nElectric utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure, like KCP&L and GMO, may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. The Companies' facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of any such cyber attacks. The Companies' business relies on information technology for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, their primary business, as well as in secondary operational functions, including supply chain, and invoicing and collecting payments from customers. In the ordinary course of business, the Companies collect, store and transmit sensitive data including operating information, proprietary business information belonging to the Companies and third parties and personal information belonging to customers and employees. To the extent that a cyber attack was successful, customer and employee information may be stolen, equipment may be destroyed or damaged and operations of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system may be disrupted. In such an event, the Companies may experience substantial loss of revenues, material response costs and other financial loss, including the increased cost of insurance coverage. The Companies could also be subject to litigation, increased regulation and reputational damage. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to their systems.\nIn the course of their businesses, the Companies handle a range of system security and sensitive customer information. KCP&L and GMO are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of the utilities' information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or\nsystem operating information, could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies.\nKCP&L and GMO operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructures. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, employee error or malfeasance, or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of generation, transmission and distribution systems, result in legal claims and proceedings, damage the Companies' reputation and also subject the Companies to financial harm. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely way, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved.\nGreat Plains Energy's and KCP&L's businesses are capital intensive. The Companies currently have significant capital projects pending and may also have significant capital projects in the future. The risks of any capital project include: that actual costs may exceed estimated costs due to inflation or other factors; risks associated with the incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of additional equity to fund such projects; delays that may occur in obtaining permits and materials; the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts; inadequate availability or increased cost of equipment, materials or qualified craft labor; delays related to inclement weather; the scope, cost and timing of projects may change due to new or changed environmental requirements, health and safety laws or other factors; and other events beyond the Companies' control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects.\nThese and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of capital projects, delay the in-service dates of projects, adversely affect the performance of the projects, and/or require the Companies to purchase additional electricity to supply their respective retail customers until the projects are completed. Thus, these risks may significantly affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure of one or more generation plant co-owners to pay their share of construction or operations and maintenance costs could increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek, 50% of La Cygne Station, 70% of Iatan No. 1 and 55% of Iatan No. 2. GMO owns 18% of both Iatan units and 8% of Jeffrey Energy Center. The remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs.\nWhile the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co-owner's share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non-defaulting co-owners, there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non-defaulting co-owners. Occurrence of these or other events could materially increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nKCP&L is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, which could result in an adverse effect on the Companies' business and financial results.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including Wolf Creek. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down the facilities, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Additionally, the non-compliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry as a whole. Any revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could result in substantial capital expenditures at Wolf Creek.\nWolf Creek has the lowest fuel cost per MWh of any of KCP&L's generating units. An extended outage of Wolf Creek, whether resulting from NRC action, an incident at the plant or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the event KCP&L incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates or insurance. If a long-term outage\noccurred, the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the Wolf Creek investment from rate base. Wolf Creek was constructed prior to 1986 and the age of Wolf Creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs.\nOwnership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes KCP&L to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit's life. KCP&L contributes annually based on estimated decommissioning costs to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek. The funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets. If the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated, KCP&L could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates.\nKCP&L is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, including, but not limited to, (i) potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit, (ii) the storage, handling, disposal and potential release (by accident, through third-party actions or otherwise) of radioactive materials and (iii) uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate. Under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units, KCP&L is also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments (subject to a cap) per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage.\nThe structure of the regional power market in which the Companies operate could have an adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn March 2014, the SPP launched its Integrated Marketplace. Similar to other RTO or ISO markets, this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. In the event that KCP&L's and GMO's generating units are not among the lowest cost generating units operating within the market, KCP&L and GMO could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales.\nA market for Transmission Congestion Rights (TCR) is also included as part of the Integrated Marketplace. TCRs are financial instruments used to hedge transmission congestion charges. Both KCP&L and GMO acquire TCRs for the purpose of hedging against transmission congestion charges. There is a risk that KCP&L and GMO could incorrectly model the amount of TCRs needed, or that the TCRs acquired could be ineffective in hedging against transmission congestion charges which could lead to increased purchased power costs.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change from time to time and such changes could impact the Companies' costs and revenues. Because the manner in which RTO's or ISO's will evolve is unclear, the Companies are unable to assess fully the impact of these changes.\nLitigation Risks:\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Companies may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters.", "PERMNO": 24432, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "GXP"}
