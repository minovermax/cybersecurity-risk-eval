{"cik": "716643", "company": "REGIS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that has spread globally. COVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, including the temporary closure of all of our company-owned salons and almost all of our franchise locations for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020; implementation of a furlough program in the fourth quarter for a substantial majority of our workforce across our corporate office, field support and distribution centers; and temporary reductions in the pay for executives and other working employees at different levels for approximately two months during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. The pandemic may affect the health and welfare of our stylist community, customers, franchise partners or headquarters personnel. As of the date of this filing, a majority of our company-owned and franchise salons have re-opened after having been temporarily closed for several weeks and/or months during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. While most of our salons have been able to re-open, we expect that states may decide to again require the closure of salons as the level of COVID-19 positive cases continue to fluctuate, as we have already seen in California. Each time we are required to close and re-open salons, we will continue to experience the risks and business impacts described here, and further requirements to again close salons or limit and/or modify services or operations may exacerbate these impacts.\nThe unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, including the rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto, makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to resume and/or continue operations or generate growth or achieve our initial or any revised objectives for calendar year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. In particular, the uncertainty around COVID-19 will likely delay and/or impair our ability to convert to a fully-franchised model by the end of calendar year 2020 as we had previously expected or for the net cash proceeds we had expected, and we may need to explore other transactions, such as closing or selling off certain salons.\nIn addition, as our stores are able to resume operations, some of our franchisees, many of whom were in the early stages of developing their businesses prior to the onset of the pandemic, have chosen or may choose not to due to a variety of factors, resume operation of their salons and/or they are facing challenges rehiring employees, reestablishing operations with their landlords and other vendors, and attracting customers back to their salons. As a result, in addition to our prior decision to suspend collection of franchise ad fund fees from our franchisees from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, many of our franchisees have requested reductions or other modifications to their royalty payments or other amounts due to us, which may be critical to their ability to reestablishing operations, and they may simply be unable or unwilling to make lease, royalty or other payments to us and may be unable to continue to operate or need to close the salon. The removal or reduction of these payments, including the added expense associated with closed locations where the Company may have residual lease liability, has and is expected to continue to adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Customers and employees may be cautious about returning to personal service providers, and we and our franchisees are incurring substantial additional costs to ensure the safety of our employees and customers. While we may experience an initial increased customer demand for our services and products when businesses\u2019 resume operation, there is no assurance that such immediate increase will be sustained. Furthermore, many of our customers have themselves experienced adverse financial impacts from the pandemic, including loss of disposable income, which may limit their spending on personal care, including purchasing of beauty products, or have identified other means for hair care during the pandemic. The trend of increased remote work and utilization of advanced video-conferencing technology has led to a less-formal work environment which could impact the frequency of our hair care services. In addition, efforts to lift restrictions on individuals\u2019 daily activities and businesses\u2019 normal operations may result in a resurgence of COVID-19 and potentially prolong and intensify the impact of the crisis, including additional workers compensation claims and customer claims associated with the pandemic. Further, the pandemic could impact workers at our headquarters or compromise the performance of our Fremont, CA technology center.\nAs a result, COVID-19 has and will continue to negatively affect our revenue, increase the cost of salon operations, increase our investment in safety equipment and potentially expose us to additional liability, the combination of which will reduce our profitability, including the profitability of our franchisees. In addition, we retain residual real estate lease liability of $817.7 million for company-owned and nearly all franchise stores. The combination of the revenue reduction, obligations we ultimately owe to landlords, and other costs both related and unrelated to COVID-19 could significantly reduce or exhaust our available liquidity over time and limit our ability to access liquidity sources. While the economic impact of COVID-19 to our franchisees may be reduced by financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act or other similar COVID-19 related federal and state programs, such programs may not have a positive impact on our corporate financial results and we believe we are currently ineligible for these programs.\nAmong other things, while we have begun to call employees back to work, the temporary furlough of most of our employees has impacted various operational and risk management functions, including our audit and financial reporting function. These reductions could temporarily impair our ability to timely and accurately report information to regulators and our shareholders and impair our business risk management protocols. Additionally, some stylist employees have chosen not to return to the salon environment during the time of COVID-19.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we currently anticipate a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. The disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with a sustained decline in our stock price, may lead to triggering events that may indicate that the carrying value of certain assets, including accounts receivables, long-lived assets, intangibles, and goodwill, may not be recoverable. Assessing goodwill for impairment requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company had been derecognizing Company-owned goodwill as part of the calculation of gain or loss on the sale of salons to franchisees. Based on the results of items referenced above, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge to fully impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our Company-owned reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.\nCOVID-19, and the volatile local, regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, including government mandates, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results, certain litigation or regulatory risks or the value of our salon brands in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nTo date we have been successful in selling our company-owned salons to franchise owners and we are re-engineering our corporate and field infrastructure to support a fully-franchised portfolio, which involves risks to our financial condition and results of operations in both our company-owned and franchise portfolios.\nWe have been successful in selling our company-owned salons to franchise owners and, as a result, our inability to re-engineer the infrastructure and reduce our costs on timing and in amounts necessary to effectively support a fully-franchised salon portfolio may reduce the anticipated economic benefit of the transformation in the near term. Furthermore, our efforts to re-engineer and reduce the corporate and field infrastructure devoted to supporting company-owned stores may impair our ability to effectively support the remaining company-owned salons and diminish the value of those salons while we own them, which challenges our ability to sell such salons to franchisees, and adversely impacts the timing of venditions and net cash proceeds we generate from the sales process. In addition, as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, all company-owned salons were temporarily closed for several weeks, which has caused, among other things, a loss of stylists and customers, and which could diminish the value and timing of the salons in any future transfer of the ownership as part of our continued commitment to converting to a fully-franchised model.\nWe are now substantially dependent on franchise royalties and product sales and the overall success of our franchisees\u2019 salons. It customarily takes new franchisees time to develop their salons and increase their sales. Further, a number of our historically successful and more experienced franchisees are onboarding new salon operations. This could adversely impact our revenue and profitability during this next stage of our transformation. Additionally, we expect that our franchisees will purchase products and services from us for their businesses, but there is no assurance that they will do so in quantities or at wholesale pricing levels consistent with our expectations or past practices. Further, in order to support and enhance our franchisees\u2019 businesses, we may need to invest in certain unanticipated new capabilities and/or services, and we will need to determine the appropriate amount of investment to optimize the success of our franchisees, while ensuring that the level of investment supports our expected return on those investments. If we are not able to identify the right level of support and effectively deliver those resources to our franchisees, our results of operations and business may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our transition to a fully-franchised model may expose us to additional legal, compliance and operational risks specific to this different business model, including the business failure of unproven new salon owners.\nWe have made significant investments in company-owned technology, including a new back office salon management system that may not yield results on the timing or amounts we expect due to the COVID-19 pandemic and pending litigation that has been filed by our existing back office salon management system supplier.\nInvestments made in company-owned technology, including the Company's new, internally developed back office salon management system, OpenSalon Pro, may not yield the profitable results on the timing or in amounts that we anticipate. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to successfully launch this new system on the timing and levels of profitability we had originally anticipated. In addition, our existing point of sale system supplier has challenged the development of certain parts of our technology systems in litigation brought in the Northern District of California, case No. 20-cv-02181-MMC. We have vigorously denied the allegations made by this third-party supplier and have asserted certain counterclaims against the third party. However, the dispute regarding our ownership and involvement of certain key personnel may be costly and distracting, and the outcome is currently uncertain. Further, this litigation may delay the migration or ultimate success of our new technology.\nCOVID-19 may impact the operations of the Company's key suppliers, including its merchandise, personal protective equipment (PPE) and technology suppliers.\nThe Company depends upon the support of a small number of critical suppliers, including its merchandise, PPE and technology providers, including its third-party point of sale system supplier. We have experienced limited disruption in operations from these suppliers. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may pose additional disruptions in our supply chain or in the in the availability of products and services, or could increase the prices we pay to our suppliers, which could result in a material impact to our own operations.\nThe Company and its franchisees\u2019 efforts to address rent obligations incurred during the government-mandated hibernation of and ongoing government-imposed operational limits placed on our salons related to the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing and the ability to obtain long-term rent concessions is important to our future success.\nThe Company and its franchisees\u2019 efforts to address rent obligations incurred during the government-mandated hibernation and ongoing government-imposed operational limits placed on our salons related to the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing and the ability to obtain long-term rent concessions is important to our future success. While we and our franchisees have paid a significant portion of the rent due through August 2020 after giving effect to various abatement and deferral structures in place for certain lease agreements, certain of our landlords have alleged that we are in default of our leases with them. If we are unable to reach an agreement with these landlords, we or our franchisees may face eviction proceedings and/or incur costs related to litigation which could be expensive, and may jeopardize the ability to continue operations at the impacted salons and may impact our relationships with the landlords or our franchisees. The Company or franchisees also may choose from time to time to cease operations at certain salons where profitability is especially impacted by rent obligations and other challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Should this occur, we may incur significant costs associated with lease terminations and winding down of operations at the affected salons if we are unable to find a replacement franchisee or determine that it is uneconomic to operate the affected salon as a company-owned business since the Company is the primary tenant on the lease for corporate and substantially all franchised salons. Whether the Company would recoup its costs from the affected franchisee for their obligations under the sublease to the Company for these locations is uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected our franchisees ability to open organic and venditioned salons. Franchisees have delayed some openings and will likely continue to evaluate the pace and quantity of salon development, including purchasing salons from the Company, until more clarity on the post-COVID-19 operating environment emerges. Delays in organic development or the Company\u2019s transfer of existing corporate salons to franchisees in this environment may also reduce the purchase price of such venditioned salons, the royalties and other fees received from franchisees, lead to disputes with franchisees, overall have an adverse effect on our revenues, and could result in future impairment charges, especially if the effects of the pandemic extend for a significant amount of time or grow in severity. In addition, the commercial real estate industry, including our landlords, are experiencing tenants requesting rent abatements and reductions during COVID-19, which could lead to an increase in tenant evictions and vacant spaces, landlord bankruptcies, mall and/or shopping center foreclosures, and as a result, the properties at which the Company and its franchisees operate may not be as appealing for our customers to visit and therefore cause a decrease in foot traffic and revenue at the impacted salons.\nWe may face challenges operating the salons that TBG transferred back to us, and our inability to operate them successfully, close them, or transfer these salons to new ownership could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 31, 2019, we re-acquired certain assets that were used in the operation of the mall-based salon business in the United States and Canada at which we had residual real estate lease liability from our original sale of the salons to TBG. The transfer was consummated in connection with an assignment for the benefit of creditors by TBG. The assets acquired in connection with the salon reacquisition are, in the aggregate, unprofitable and the total lease liability related to the salons is approximately $23 million as of June 30, 2020. We are attempting to renegotiate these lease obligations; however, the outcome of those negotiations is currently uncertain. In addition to the salons, we assumed limited liabilities for certain employee benefit related payments. In connection with the reacquisition of the salons, we also terminated certain other agreements we had with TBG that we had already recorded a full reserve against the promissory notes evidencing TBG\u2019s obligations to us. As a result of our reacquisition of these salons in connection with TBG assignment for the benefit of creditors, there is a risk that a creditor of TBG could seek to void or otherwise challenge the transfer as a preference transaction. If a TBG creditor was successful in making such a claim, we could remain liable on the leases without the ability to operate the salons to generate revenue to fund the lease obligations.\nWhile we believe the salons transferred back to us have been able to continue operations without any significant disruptions so far, except for the impacts arising out of COVID-19, these salons have experienced significant changes in recent years and, as a result, there is a risk of increased levels of employee attrition, customer losses, and supplier interruption. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of the employee base, particularly our stylists, as well as fruition of other risks could adversely affect our results of operations and could diminish the value of the salons in any future transfer of the ownership of these salons to new ownership as part of our continued commitment to converting to a fully-franchised model. If we are not able to successfully operate these salons, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover the lease liabilities for these salons. As a result, we may be compelled to close certain salons or sell the assets at depressed values. In the meantime, we expect that our operation of these salons may adversely impact our results of operations. Our inability to successfully operate the salons or transfer them to new stable ownership, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTBG\u2019s transfer of salons in the United Kingdom to the Bushell Investment Group, which became our franchisee, is subject to review by the administrator in TBG\u2019s insolvency proceeding in the United Kingdom.\nAs previously announced, we entered into a franchise agreement with the Bushell Investment Group (Bushell), which acquired over 100 salons in the United Kingdom from TBG in December 2019. The transaction occurred in connection with TBG\u2019s insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom. While we do not have any financial obligations in connection with the salons transferred to Bushell, the administrator in TBG\u2019s insolvency proceeding has a legal obligation to review our original and subsequent transactions with TBG in the United Kingdom. If the administrator were to challenge our original transaction with TBG, the administrator could seek remedies to effectively unwind the economics of the original transaction or impair the ability of Bushell to continue operating these salons as our franchisee. While we do not expect the administrator to identify any concerns with our original or any subsequent transaction, any allegations against the validity of these transactions could disrupt the operation of the salons by Bushell and we could face significant adverse financial impacts or management distraction.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our existing financing arrangement, we may not be able to access our existing revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nIf we fail to comply with our existing financing arrangements, it may cause a default under our financing arrangement, which could limit our ability to obtain new replacement financing or additional financing under our existing credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness. We believe that the amendment of our financing arrangement in May 2020 will allow us to remain in compliance with the revised covenants notwithstanding the impacts to our business of converting to a fully-franchised model and other impacts arising out of COVID-19; however, significant and continued business disruptions could ultimately impair our ability to comply with the new liquidity covenant, which could preclude our ability to access our credit facility or accelerate our debt repayment obligation, which is now secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company's assets.\nIt is important for us and our franchisees to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests and the customer experience in our franchised and company-owned salons. Qualified, trained stylists are key to a memorable guest experience that creates loyal customers. In order to profitably grow our business, it is important for our franchisees and company-owned salons to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons. Because the salon industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is typically highly competitive. In addition, increases in minimum wage requirements may impact the number of stylists considering careers outside the beauty industry. In some markets, we and our franchisees have experienced a shortage of qualified stylists. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education and training programs are important elements to attracting and retaining qualified stylists. In addition, due to challenges facing the for-profit education industry, cosmetology schools have experienced declines in enrollment, revenues and profitability in recent years. If the cosmetology school industry sustains further declines in enrollment or some schools close entirely, or if stylists leave the beauty industry, we expect that we and our franchisees would have increased difficulty staffing our salons in some markets. In addition, we have observed that some stylists are not comfortable coming back to the salon environment during COVID-19 and the enhanced unemployment amounts provided by the federal government during COVID-19 in some cases decreases stylists' incentive to come back to work during COVID-19. If our company-owned salons or franchisees are not successful in attracting, training and retaining stylists or in staffing our salons, our same-store sales or the performance of our franchise business could experience periods of variability or sales could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends in part on the success of our franchisees, which operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2020, approximately 76.1% of our salons were franchised locations, and we continue to pursue conversion to a fully-franchised model. We derive revenues associated with our franchised locations from royalties, fees and product sales to franchised locations. Our financial results are therefore substantially dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. As we increase our focus on our franchise business, our dependence on our franchisees grows.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. Though we have established operational standards and guidelines, they own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their salon locations including employee-related matters and pricing. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and image could be harmed, and our financial results could be affected. We could experience greater risks as the scale of our franchise owners increases. Further, some franchise owners may not successfully execute the rebranding and/or turnaround of under-performing salons which we have transferred to them particularly in the post-COVID environment.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by competition for both guests and stylists, market trends, price competition and disruptions in their markets and business operations due to public health issues, including pandemics, severe weather and other external events. Like us, they rely on external vendors for some critical functions and to protect their company data. They may also be limited in their ability to open new locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially since many of them are small businesses with much more limited access to financing than our Company, or by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations, or by government-mandated restrictions on salon operations due to COVID-19 or other pandemics. They may also experience financial distress as a result of over-leveraging, which could negatively affect our operating results as a result of delayed or non-payments to us. The bankruptcy, default, abandonment, or other default or breach by or of a franchisee could also expose us to liability under leases, which are generally sub-leased by us to our franchisees.\nA deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, or a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements, could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments, fees and product revenues.\nThe sale of company-owned salons to franchisees may not improve our operating results and could cause operational difficulties.\nIn August 2019, the Company announced our plan to convert to a fully-franchised platform over time. While we have had significant success in converting our salons to franchisees, our continued success will depend on a number of factors, including franchisees\u2019 ability to improve the results of the salons they purchase, their ability and interest in continuing to grow their business, and their willingness to purchase salons during the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed closure and operational limitations. We also must continue to attract qualified franchisees and work with them to make their business successful. Moving a salon from company-owned to franchise-owned is expected to reduce our consolidated revenues, increase our royalty revenue and decrease our operating costs; however, the actual benefit from a sale is uncertain and may be insufficient to offset the loss of revenues. Also, our gross margins on wholesale product sales are lower than our gross margins on retail product sales. Furthermore, the timing of decreasing operating costs may significantly lag the transfer to franchisees, because it takes time to reduce the general and administrative costs directly or indirectly associated with a transferred salon.\nIn addition, challenges in supporting our expanding franchise system could cause our operating results to suffer. If we are unable to effectively select and train new franchisees and support our growing franchisee base, it could affect our brand standards, cause disputes between us and our franchisees, and potentially lead to material liabilities.\nIf our capital investments in developing new technology-enabled capabilities and improving current technology infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are currently making, and expect to continue to make, strategic investments in technology to improve guest experiences and improve our back-office systems, including, without limitation, our OpenSalon mobile application and platform that we launched in 2019 and our OpenSalon Pro salon management system that we launched in August 2020. These investments might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired return and could expose us to additional legal and compliance risks. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s technology capabilities and developments involve third party partnerships, on which we are dependent. If these partnerships are not successful, the capabilities may not fully achieve their anticipated returns. In addition, if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments, the value received from those investments may be eroded, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Among other things, targeting the wrong investment opportunities, failing to successfully meet our strategic objectives when making the correct investments, being unable to make new concepts scalable or achieving appropriate market or franchisee adoption, and/or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our existing third-party back office salon management supplier may try to make our franchisees' transition to OpenSalon Pro difficult or costly, which could cause our anticipated benefits or desired returns from our new back office salon management technology to decrease.\nCybersecurity incidents could result in the compromise of potentially sensitive information about our guests, franchisees, employees, vendors or company and expose us to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe normal operations of our business and our new investments in technology involve processing, transmission and storage of potentially personal information about our guests as well as employees, franchisees, vendors and our Company. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations and their third-party vendors are constantly evolving, and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive guest information have occurred at a number of large U.S. companies in recent years. Despite the security measures and processes we have in place, our efforts, and those of our third-party vendors, to protect sensitive guest, franchisee, Company and employee information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems or detecting and responding to a breach on a timely basis. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems, our systems could be interrupted or damaged, or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that occurred, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons altogether or our franchisees could exit the system due to lack of confidence as well. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies' obligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits with the possibility of substantial damages. These laws are changing rapidly and vary among jurisdictions. Furthermore, while our franchisees are independently responsible for data security at their franchised locations, a breach of guest or vendor data at a franchised location could also negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and disaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of operations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nOur ability to franchise our company-owned SmartStyle salons and successfully operate this business is dependent on our relationship with Walmart.\nAt June 30, 2020, we had 2,068 SmartStyle or Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations, including 4 salons opened during fiscal year 2020 (net of relocations). Walmart is our largest landlord, and we believe we are Walmart\u2019s largest tenant. Our business within each of those 2,068 salons relies primarily on the traffic of visitors to the Walmart in which it is located, so our success is tied to Walmart\u2019s success in bringing shoppers into their stores. We have limited control over the locations and markets in which we open new SmartStyle locations, as we only have potential opportunities in locations offered to us by Walmart. Furthermore, Walmart has the right to close up to 100 of our salons per year for any reason, upon payment of certain penalties; to terminate lease agreements for breach, such as if we failed to conform with required operating hours, subject to a notice and cure period; and to terminate the lease if the Walmart store in which it sits is closed. Furthermore, in an effort to manage traffic flow and direction during COVID-19, Walmart has elected at some stores to close one or more of its primary entryways. We have found that when the entry way nearest to our salon is closed, foot traffic in the salon is materially reduced. We are currently discussing this issue and other issues related to COVID-19 with Walmart, but there is no assurance they will be resolved. In fiscal year 2017, we began franchising select SmartStyle branded locations. Future franchising activity will require and be limited by the approval of Walmart on a location by location basis. Walmart may not give their approval to franchise some or all of our company-owned salons. Further, Walmart may attempt to impose changes to the terms and conditions of our agreements which are contrary to our economic interests. Operating both company-owned and franchised SmartStyle salons adds complexity in overseeing franchise compliance and coordination with Walmart.\nRecent actions by Walmart have materially impacted our SmartStyle franchise operations.\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, Walmart issued a mandatory mask requirement for customers who visit their U.S. store operations. In order to enforce this requirement, Walmart has closed several entrances to its stores including entrances at the front of their brick and mortar locations where many of our SmartStyle and Cost Cutters salons are located. Although we appreciate and support Walmart\u2019s national effort to require the use of masks by their customers their decision to close entrances located near our salons has materially reduced customer traffic and salon revenues in both our franchise and company-owned operations. We have addressed these issues directly with Walmart and are hopeful that this will prove to be a temporary policy. However, we cannot be certain when or if Walmart will reopen their store entrances. As a result, this could lead to further deterioration in, or subsequent closures of, our SmartStyle or Cost Cutters brands during the period of the pandemic or as long as Walmart continues to close these entrances or potentially expose Regis to litigation, sublease rent default exposure, or could compel the Company to pursue certain other remedies from Walmart up to or including litigation and/or termination of certain locations.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to build awareness and drive traffic with advertising and marketing efforts, and on delivering a quality guest experience to drive repeat visits to our salons.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and spending levels of our marketing and advertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. In addition, delivering a quality guest experience is crucial in order to drive repeat visits to our salons. We are developing our marketing and advertising strategies, including national and local campaigns, to build awareness, drive interest, consideration and traffic to our salons. We are also focusing on improving guest experiences to provide brand differentiation and preference, and to ensure we meet our guests\u2019 needs. If our marketing, advertising and improved guest experience efforts do not generate sufficient customer traffic and repeat visits to our salons, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in regulatory and statutory laws, such as increases in the minimum wage and changes that make collective bargaining easier, and the costs of compliance and non-compliance with such laws, may result in increased costs to our business.\nWith 6,923 locations and approximately 9,000 employees worldwide, our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws. Due to the number of people we or our franchisees employ, laws that increase minimum wage rates, employment taxes, overtime requirements or costs to provide employee benefits or administration may result in additional costs to our Company.\nA number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and municipalities in which we do business have recently increased or are considering increasing the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the employer. Increases in minimum wages and overtime pay increase our costs, and our ability to offset these increases through price increases may be limited. In fact, increases in minimum wages increased our costs over the last five years. In addition, a growing number of states, provinces, and municipalities have passed or are considering requirements for paid sick leave, family leave, predictive scheduling (which imposes penalties for changing an employee\u2019s shift as it nears), and other requirements that increase the administrative complexity of managing our workforce. Finally, changes in labor laws, such as recent legislation in Ontario and Alberta designed to facilitate union organizing, could increase the likelihood of some of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in minimum wages, administrative requirements and unionization could also have an adverse effect on the performance of our franchisees, especially if our franchisees are treated as a \"joint employer\" with us by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or as a large employer under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliation with us. In addition, we must comply with state employment laws, including the California Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nVarious state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability, or other theories or liabilities. All such legal actions not only could result in changes to laws and interpretations, making it more difficult to appropriately support our franchisees and, consequently, impacting our performance, but, also, such legal actions could result in expensive litigation with our franchisees, third parties or government agencies that could adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees. In addition, other regulatory or legal developments may result in changes to laws or the franchisee/franchisor relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profits.\nIn addition to employment and franchise laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those affecting public companies, product manufacture and sale, and governing the franchisee/franchisor relationship, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product recalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands, our customers\u2019 connection to our brands, and a positive relationship with our franchisees. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity, including via social media, or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies, our development efforts, or the ordinary course of our, or our franchisees\u2019, business. Other incidents may arise from events that may be beyond our control and may damage our brands, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health, safety, welfare, or otherwise; litigation and claims; security breaches or other fraudulent activities associated with our back office management or payment systems; and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Consumer demand for our products and services and our brands\u2019 value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products or services, which could result in lower sales and, ultimately, lower royalty income, and in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPremature termination of franchise agreements can cause losses.\nOur franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as failure of a franchisee to cure a default, monetary or otherwise, a franchisee bankruptcy, or abandonment of the franchise. If terminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses and/or to take back and operate such salons as company-owned. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the franchise agreement. In addition, with many of our brands, we remain liable under the lease and, therefore, will be obligated to pay rent or enter into a settlement with the landlord, and we may not be made whole by the franchisee. A significant loss of franchisee agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. If we experience an interruption in their operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, generate payroll information, monitor salon performance, manage salon staffing and payroll costs, manage our two distribution centers and other inventory and other functions. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, security breaches, and natural disasters. In addition, certain of our management information systems are currently developed and maintained by external vendors, including our back office salon management system, and some are outdated or of limited functionality, not owned by the Company or not exclusively provided by the Company. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, or provide an affordable long-term solution, could disrupt our business operations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, and reputational damage. These external vendors' conduct with respect to our franchisees could also result in litigation.\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nWe rely on external vendors for the manufacture of our owned brand products, other retail products we sell, and products we use during salon services such as color and chemical treatments. We also rely on external vendors for various services critical to our operations and the security of certain Company data. Our dependence on vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial, and compliance risk.\nIf our product offerings do not meet our guests\u2019 expectations regarding safety and quality, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products and packages we buy, for either use on a guest during a service or resale to the public, comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or mislabeling could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.\nOur vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data, as discussed above. In the event that one of our key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, are compromised or the quality of their systems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nConsumer shopping trends and changes in manufacturer choice of distribution channels may negatively affect both service and product revenues.\nBoth our franchised and company-owned salons are partly dependent on the volume of traffic around their locations in order to generate both service and product revenues. Supercuts salons and most of our other brands are located mainly in strip center locations, which have been significantly impacted by landlord closures due to COVID-19, and SmartStyle salons are located within Walmart Supercenters, so they are especially sensitive to Walmart traffic. Customer traffic may be adversely affected by changing consumer shopping trends that favor alternative shopping locations, such as the internet. In recent years, we have experienced substantial declines in traffic in some shopping malls in particular and traffic patterns at those salons affect our potential product sales revenues and impact the health of our brands.\nIn addition, we are experiencing a proliferation of alternative channels of distribution, like blow dry bars, booth rental facilities, discount brick-and-mortar and online professional products retailers, and manufacturers selling direct to consumers online, which may negatively affect our product and service revenue. Also, product manufacturers may decide to utilize these other distribution channels to a larger extent than in the past and they generally have the right to terminate relationships with us with little advance notice. These trends could reduce the volume of traffic around our salons, and in turn, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market by market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with local operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry as a whole is fragmented and highly competitive for customers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. Our strategies for competing are complicated by the fact that we have multiple brands in multiple segments, which compete on different factors.\nWe also face significant competition for prime real estate, particularly in strip malls. We compete for lease locations not only with other hair salons, but with a wide variety of businesses looking for similar square footage and high-quality locations.\nFurthermore, our reputation is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. Our reputation may be damaged by negative publicity on social media or other channels regarding the quality of products or services we provide. There has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, which allow individuals to be heard by a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative or false commentary regarding us or the products or services we offer may be posted on social media platforms at any time. Customers value readily available information and may act on information without further investigation or regard to its accuracy. The harm to our reputation may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may also be damaged by factors that are mostly or entirely out of our control, including actions by a franchisee or a franchisee\u2019s employee. If we are not able to successfully compete, our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent or detect material misstatement due to fraud, which could reduce investor confidence and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be materially misstated. We identified an error in our quarterly financial statements related to the derecognition of goodwill associated with company-owned salons that were sold in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that resulted in a revision to our financial statements for that quarter. As a result, we concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over the accounting for non-cash goodwill derecognition existed until the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, at which time the conditions causing the material weakness no longer existed and are not expected to exist. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, reduce investor confidence, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes and payroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and employment taxes. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, or the outcome of income examinations.\nFailure to simplify and standardize our operating processes across our brands could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe expect standardization of operating processes across our brands, marketing and products to enable us to simplify our operating model and decrease our costs and believe failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to grow revenue and realize further efficiencies within our results of operations.\nEmpire Education Group may be unsuccessful which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our 55% ownership stake in Empire Education Group (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools to the other owner. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval before it can close, and there is no guarantee that the regulatory approval will occur, which has been delayed in part due to COVID-19. Due to poor financial performance, we fully impaired the investment in prior years. If the transaction does not close as anticipated and EEG is unsuccessful in executing its business plan, or if economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in enrollment, revenue and profitability continue for the for-profit secondary education market, our financial results may be affected by certain potential liabilities related to this investment. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2021, at which time the Company expects to record an immaterial non-operating gain.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our cost of product, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond our control, such as recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather patterns, viruses, pandemics, stay-at-home orders and other casualty events that influence consumer confidence and spending, may impact our business. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by increases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns may impact our revenue.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely manner to changes in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns. If we do not timely identify and properly respond to evolving trends and changing consumer demands for hair care, our sales may decline. Furthermore, we may accumulate additional inventory and be required to mark down unsold inventory to prices that are lower than normal prices, which could adversely impact our margins and could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational failure at one of our distribution centers would impact our ability to distribute products.\nWe operate two distribution centers, one near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and one near Salt Lake City, Utah. These supply our North America company-owned salons and many of our franchisees with retail products to sell and products used during salon services. They also provide 3PL services for other third-party manufacturers for a profit. If there were a technology failure, natural disaster or other catastrophic event that caused one of the distribution centers to be inoperable, it would cause a disruption in our business and could negatively impact our revenues.\nOur enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor the risks that we face. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks, compliance with applicable law, and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types of risk in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to the Company in order to manage certain types of risks, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies or programs are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe franchise arrangements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance coverages and levels. Certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchisee\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise arrangement, including its ability to make royalty payments.\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our management team and others throughout our organization. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, for whom we compete with other companies both inside and outside our industry. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of any of our management team or other key personnel, or more generally if we fail to identify, recruit, train and/or retain talented personnel. Additionally, the Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement may end before the Company's multi-year strategic transformation is complete, or before the impact of the pandemic has been stabilized. Further, any successor candidate, no matter how well-qualified, may not be successful in a post-COVID environment.", "PERMNO": 76711, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "RGS"}
