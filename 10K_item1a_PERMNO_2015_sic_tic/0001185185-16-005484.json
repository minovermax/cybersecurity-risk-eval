RISK FACTORS\nHistorically, we have lost money from operations and we have made no provision for any contingency, unexpected expenses or increases in costs that may arise.\nSince inception, we have been able to cover our operating losses from the sale of our securities. We do not know if these sources of funds will be available to cover future operating losses. If we are unable to obtain adequate sources of funds to operate our business we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur business operations and plans could be adversely affected in the event we need additional financing and are unable to obtain such funding. To the extent that our business strategy requires expanding our operations, such expansion could be costly to implement and may cause us to experience significant continuing losses. It is possible that our available short-term assets and anticipated revenues may not be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, business expansion plans, and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Insufficient funds may prevent us from implementing our business strategy or may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate certain opportunities for the commercialization of our technology and products. If we cannot generate adequate sales of our products, or increase our revenues through licensing of our technology or other means, we may be forced to cease operations.\nIn order to succeed as a company, we must continue to manufacture quality products and sell adequate quantities of products at prices sufficient to generate profits. We may not accomplish these objectives. A number of factors may affect future sales of our products even if we are successful in increasing our revenue base. These factors include whether competitors produce alternative or superior products and whether the cost of implementing our products is competitive in the marketplace.\nIn addition, we are attempting to increase revenues through licensing our technology and manufacturing rights, and selling polyurethane chemical systems to customers that produce their own products. If these proposals are not viable in the marketplace, we may not generate significant revenues from these efforts.\nThe \u201cslow growth\u201d in the U.S. economy could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial position.\nThe U.S. economy has experienced \u201cslow growth\u201d since the last U.S. recession and general downturn in the global economy. A continuation or worsening of these conditions, including credit and capital markets disruptions, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial position in a number of ways. We may experience declines in revenues and cash flows as a result of reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and prospective customers. We may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and customers. We may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with our ability to borrow in the future or otherwise with financing our operating, investing or financing activities. Any of these potential problems could hinder our efforts to increase our sales and might, if severe and extensive enough, cause our sales to decline, jeopardizing our ability to operate.\nWe may experience delays in resolving unexpected technical issues experienced in completing development of new technology that will increase development costs and postpone anticipated sales and revenues.\nAs we develop and improve our products, we frequently must solve chemical, manufacturing and/or equipment-related issues. Some of these issues are ones that we cannot anticipate because the products we are developing are new. If we must revise existing manufacturing processes or order specialized equipment to address a particular issue, we may not meet our projected timetable for bringing products to market. Such delays may interfere with existing manufacturing schedules, negatively affect revenues and increase our cost of operations.\nWe have entered new market segments where we have limited resources, and we may be unable to successfully manage planned growth.\nWe have limited experience within the new market segments we have entered. We have less marketing and product development resources at our disposal compared to our competitors in the tire industry. To remain profitable, our products must be cost-effective, economical to produce, and have the ability to be distributed on a commercial scale. Furthermore, if our technologies and products do not achieve, or if they are unable to maintain, market acceptance or regulatory approval, we may not be profitable.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to license, market and distribute, and commercialize our technologies and products effectively. We have limited manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. We may not properly ascertain or assess any and all risks inherent in the industry. We may not be successful in entering into new licensing or marketing arrangements. If we are unable to meet the challenges posed by our planned licensing, manufacturing, distribution and sales growth, our business may fail.\nOur limited resources and working capital levels may hinder our ability to take advantage of business development opportunities in our various market segments, reducing growth and profitability of the Company\nWe currently have limited resource levels, which has forced us to make choices regarding which market opportunities we should pursue. Our inability to raise additional working capital has resulted in the Company deferring pursuit of potentially attractive market opportunities. If we are not able to raise capital going forward, it is possible that additional opportunities to improve the Company\u2019s market position will be lost.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, including environmental and health and safety regulations.\nOur business operations are subject to a variety of national, state and local laws and regulations, many of which deal with the environment and health and safety issues. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker health and safety requirements. However, material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or interruptions in our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive on a global basis, with many companies having significantly greater resources and market share than us. Many of our competitors maintain a significantly higher level of brand recognition than we do. Their access to greater resources enables them to adapt more quickly to changes in the markets we have targeted. Our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development and sale of new products. Most of the products we have developed have not obtained broad market acceptance and rely on our emerging technology. To improve our competitive position, we will need to make significant ongoing investments in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection. We do not know if we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or if we will maintain or improve our competitive position within the markets we serve.\nWe attempt to protect the critical elements of our proprietary technology as trade secrets. Because of our reliance on trade secrets, we are unable to prevent third parties from independently developing technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or from successfully reverse engineering or otherwise replicating our technology.\nIn certain cases, where the disclosure of information required to obtain a patent would divulge critical proprietary data, we may choose not to patent elements of our proprietary technology and processes which we have developed or may develop in the future and instead rely on trade secret laws to protect certain elements of our proprietary technology and processes. For example, we rely on trade secrets to protect our key polyurethane formulations. These formulations are critical elements of and central to our proprietary technology. Our trade secrets could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees. It is also possible that others will independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. Third parties may also legally reverse engineer our products. Independent development, reverse engineering, or other legal copying of those elements of our proprietary technology that we attempt to protect as trade secrets could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without compensating us. The protection of proprietary technology through claims of trade secret status has been the subject of increasing claims and litigation by various companies both in order to protect proprietary rights as well as for competitive reasons, even when proprietary claims are unsubstantiated. The prosecution of litigation to protect our trade secrets or the defense of such claims is costly and unpredictable given the uncertainty and rapid development of the principles of law pertaining to this area. We may also be subject to claims by other parties with regard to the use of technology information and data that may be deemed proprietary to others. The independent development of technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or the reverse engineering of our products by third parties would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the loss of our ability to use any of our trade secrets or other proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because trade secrets do not ensure exclusivity and pose such issues with respect to enforcement, third parties may decline to partner with us or may pay lesser compensation for use of our technology which is protected only by trade secrets.\nOur business depends on the protection of our patents and other intellectual property and may suffer if we are unable to adequately protect such intellectual property.\nOur success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, strategic partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we license our technology or our products are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us.\nWe have been granted a number of U.S. patents relating to certain aspects of our manufacturing technology and use of polyurethane to make tires and we may seek further patents on future innovations. Our ability to either manufacture products or license our technology is substantially dependent on the validity and enforcement of these patents and patents pending. We cannot guarantee that our patents will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that patents will be issued for our patents pending, that the rights granted under the patents will provide us competitive advantages or that our current and future patent applications will be granted.\nThird parties may invalidate our patents.\nThird parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us based on, among other things:\n\u00b7 subsequently discovered prior art or engineering designs;\n\u00b7 lack of entitlement to the priority of an earlier, related application; or\n\u00b7 failure to comply with the written description, best mode, enablement or other applicable requirements.\nUnited States patent law requires that a patent must disclose the \u201cbest mode\u201d of creating and using the invention covered by a patent. If the inventor of a patent knows of a better way, or \u201cbest mode,\u201d to create the invention and fails to disclose it, that failure could result in the loss of patent rights. Our decision to protect certain elements of our proprietary technologies as trade secrets and to not disclose such technologies in patent applications, may serve as a basis for third parties to challenge and ultimately invalidate certain of our related patents based on a failure to disclose the best mode of creating and using the invention claimed in the applicable patent. If a third party is successful in challenging the validity of our patents, our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business.\nWe may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur products and technologies may be the subject of claims of intellectual property infringement in the future. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, could divert resources and attention and could require us to obtain a license to use the intellectual property of third parties. We may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. Even if a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties to obtain it. If we cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, we may be precluded from offering most or all of our products or services and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nBecause our proposed tire products are derived from new technology, our product liability insurance costs will likely increase and we may be exposed to product liability risks that could adversely affect profitability.\nEven if tests indicate that our tires meet performance standards, or if we decide to revive our highway tire product program and these tires are approved for use, these products may subject us to significant product liability claims because the technology is new and there is little history of on-road use. Moreover, because our products are and will be used in applications where their failure could result in substantial injury or death, we could also be subject to product liability claims. Introduction of such new products and increased use of our existing products will most likely increase our product liability premiums and defense of potential claims could increase insurance costs even further, which could substantially increase our expenses. Any insurance we obtain may not be sufficient to cover the losses incurred through such lawsuits.\nSignificant increases in the price of chemical raw materials, steel and other raw materials used in our products could increase our production costs and decrease our profit margins or make our products less competitive in the marketplace due to price increases.\nThe materials used to produce our products are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, the economic climate and other unforeseen trends. With respect to both polyols and isocyanates, worldwide demand is increasing and may exceed current capacity. If we are successful in implementing our business strategy, the quantities of chemical raw materials required by us or by others that utilize our technology may increase significantly. Shortages, if any, may result in chemical price increases. We have experienced increases in the cost of wheel components due to the increased cost of steel, but no supply delays or shortages. However, we anticipate that we may experience an increase in steel wheel components at such time as the Chinese government cancels any export rebates it may be currently providing Chinese wheel manufacturers. Our raw materials pricing could increase further in the future. Existing trade agreements with foreign countries may be subject to change in the future, with tariffs or import duties being levied by the US government increasing the cost of our foreign-based raw materials. Because we are introducing products that will compete, in part, on the basis of price, we may be unable to pass cost increases on to our customers. If we are unable to pass on raw material cost increases to our customers, our future results of operations and cash flow will be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to execute our business plan would be harmed if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel.\nOur polyurethane technology has been developed by a small team and only a limited number of the members of our management team maintain the technical knowledge to produce our products. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to retain and attract the services of these and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more members of our management team could hinder our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our growth strategies. Finding suitable replacements could be difficult, and competition for such personnel of similar experience is intense. We do not carry key person insurance on any of our officers.\nShareholders and potential investors may experience some difficulty trading our stock since it is only quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace. As a result, secondary trading of our shares may be subject to certain state imposed restrictions and the ability of individual stockholders to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state. A number of states require that an issuer's securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state. Further, our shares may be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the \"penny stock\" rule. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000, excluding the value of a principal residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000 by an individual, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse), are subject to additional sales practice requirements.\nFor transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to clients disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares.", "PERMNO": 91156, "SIC": 3011, "TIC": "AMTY"}
