{"cik": "1755672", "company": "Corteva, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe successful development and commercialization of Corteva\u2019s pipeline products, including Enlist E3\u2122 soybeans, will be necessary for Corteva\u2019s growth.\nCorteva uses advanced breeding technologies to produce hybrids and varieties with superior performance in farmers\u2019 fields and uses biotechnology to introduce traits that enhance specific characteristics of its crops. Corteva also uses advanced analytics, software tools, mobile communications and new planting and monitoring equipment to provide agronomic recommendations to growers. Additionally, Corteva conducts research into biological and chemical products to protect farmers\u2019 crops from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity.\nNew product concepts may be abandoned for many reasons, including greater anticipated development costs, technical difficulties, lack of efficacy, regulatory obstacles or inability to market under regulatory frameworks, competition, inability to prove the original concept, lack of demand and the need to divert focus, from time to time, to other initiatives with perceived opportunities for better returns. The processes of active ingredient development or discovery, breeding, biotechnology trait discovery and development and trait integration are lengthy, and a very small percentage of the chemicals, genes and germplasm Corteva tests is selected for commercialization. Furthermore, the length of time and the risk associated with the breeding and biotech pipelines are interlinked because both are required as a package for commercial success in markets where biotech traits are approved for growers. For example, the transition to the company\u2019s Enlist E3\u2122 soybean technology is expected to take five years and is packaged with its Enlist One\u00ae and Enlist Duo\u00ae herbicides. In countries where biotech traits are not approved for widespread use, Corteva\u2019s seed sales depend on the quality of its germplasm. While initial commercialization efforts have been promising, there are no guarantees that anticipated levels of product acceptability within Corteva's markets will be achieved or that higher quality products will not be developed by Corteva's competitors in the future.\nSpeed in discovering, developing, protecting and responding to new technologies, including new technology-based distribution channels that could facilitate Corteva\u2019s ability to engage with customers and end users, and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage. Commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market, and many of Corteva\u2019s competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new biotechnology products, improved germplasm products, biological and chemical products and agronomic recommendation products.\nCorteva participates in an industry that is highly competitive and has undergone consolidation, which could increase competitive pressures.\nCorteva currently faces significant competition in the markets in which it operates. In most segments of the market, the number of products available to the grower is steadily increasing as new products are introduced. At the same time, certain products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers for production and commercialization. Additionally, data analytic tools and web-based new direct purchase models offer increased transparency and comparability, which creates price pressures. Corteva cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors. Aggressive marketing or pricing by Corteva\u2019s competitors could adversely affect Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial conditions. As a result, Corteva continues to face significant competitive challenges.\nCorteva may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of its products, including its seed and crop protection products, which could restrict its ability to sell those products in some markets.\nRegulatory and legislative requirements affect the development, manufacture and distribution of Corteva\u2019s products, including the testing and planting of seeds containing Corteva\u2019s biotechnology traits and the import of crops grown from those seeds, and non-compliance can harm Corteva\u2019s sales and profitability.\nSeed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety, efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production, use, sale or commercialization in a given market. In certain jurisdictions, Corteva must periodically renew its approvals for both biotechnology and crop protection products, which typically require Corteva to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards which generally are more stringent since the prior registration. The regulatory approvals process is lengthy, costly, complex and in some markets unpredictable, with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. The regulatory approvals process for products that incorporate novel modes of action or new technologies can be particularly unpredictable and uncertain due to the then-current state of regulatory guidelines and objectives, as well as governmental policy considerations and non-governmental organization and other stakeholder considerations.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nFurthermore, the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country in which Corteva sells or cultivates its product, or in a country to which Corteva imports its product, may affect Corteva\u2019s ability to supply its products or export its products, or even result in crop destruction, product recalls or trade disruption, which could result in lawsuits and termination of licenses related to biotechnology traits and raw material supply agreements. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to import, including those related to the importation of crops grown from seeds containing certain traits or treated with specific chemicals, may influence the rate of adoption of new products in globally traded crops.\nAdditionally, the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of non-governmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new and existing technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. In addition, Corteva has seen an increase in recent years in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations and/or challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance. Responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. The failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on Corteva\u2019s ability to produce and sell some current and future products.\nEnforcing Corteva\u2019s intellectual property rights, or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others, could materially affect Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, plant variety protection, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and other forms of trade dress, are important to Corteva\u2019s business. Corteva endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported. However, Corteva may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Further, changes in government policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, or the public generally, could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions.\nCorteva has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict use of, access to and distribution of its intellectual property. Despite these precautions, Corteva\u2019s intellectual property is vulnerable to infringement, misappropriation and other unauthorized access, including through employee or licensee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered, Corteva reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact. Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating.\nCompetitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain. Third parties may claim Corteva\u2019s products violate their intellectual property rights. Defending such claims, even those without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, any such claim could result in Corteva\u2019s having to enter into license agreements, develop non-infringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact Corteva\u2019s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, develop and commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.\nIn addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions and/or the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership and the scope of patents relating to certain emerging technologies, competitors may be issued patents related to Corteva\u2019s business unexpectedly. These patents could reduce the value of Corteva\u2019s commercial or pipeline products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which Corteva has relied, require Corteva to seek to obtain licenses (and Corteva cannot ensure it would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms) or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to Corteva\u2019s business.\nLegislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect Corteva\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for, and otherwise enforce Corteva\u2019s patents related to, its products.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nCorteva\u2019s business may be materially affected by competition from manufacturers of generic products.\nCompetition from manufacturers of generic products is a challenge for Corteva\u2019s branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s revenues. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of Corteva\u2019s products or of a product that Corteva licenses, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of Corteva\u2019s patented products or of a product that Corteva licenses, Corteva can lose a major portion of revenues for that product, which can have a material adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s business.\nCorteva is dependent on its relationships or contracts with third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization.\nCorteva is dependent on third parties in the research, development and commercialization of its products and enters into transactions including, but not limited to, supply agreements and licensing agreements in connection with Corteva\u2019s business. The majority of Corteva\u2019s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that Corteva licenses from third parties under long-term licenses. If Corteva loses its rights under such licenses, it could negatively impact Corteva\u2019s ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products. To maintain such licenses, Corteva may elect to out-license its technology, including germplasm. There can be no guarantee that such out-licensing will not ultimately strengthen Corteva\u2019s competition thereby adversely impacting Corteva\u2019s results of operations.\nWhile Corteva relies heavily on third parties for multiple aspects of its business and commercialization activities, Corteva does not control many aspects of such third parties\u2019 activities. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with Corteva\u2019s expectations. Failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to Corteva or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any disruption in the relationship between Corteva and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development, approval or commercialization of Corteva\u2019s products and could also result in non-compliance or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for Corteva\u2019s business.\nIn addition, Corteva\u2019s agreements with third parties may obligate it to meet certain contractual or other obligations to third parties. For example, Corteva may be obligated to meet certain thresholds or abide by certain boundary conditions. If Corteva were to fail to meet such obligations to the third parties, its relationship with such third parties may be disrupted. Such a disruption could negatively impact certain of Corteva\u2019s licenses on which it depends, could cause reputational harm, and could negatively affect Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nCorteva is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, waste water discharges, the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and the use of genetically modified seeds and crop protection active ingredients by growers.\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws, regulations and standards expose Corteva to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with Corteva\u2019s business and the discontinued and divested businesses and operations of EID. As is typical for businesses like Corteva\u2019s, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and may be identified at other sites in the future. Disposal of waste from Corteva\u2019s business at off-site locations also exposes it to potential remediation costs. Consistent with past practice, Corteva is continuing to monitor, investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at several of these sites.\nCosts and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt Corteva\u2019s operations, or require modifications to its facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which may be materially higher than Corteva\u2019s accruals.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of Corteva\u2019s biotechnology and other agricultural products and technologies can affect Corteva\u2019s sales and results of operations by affecting planting approvals, regulatory requirements and customer purchase decisions.\nConcerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products in general, their potential impact on health and the environment, and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment, reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These include concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products, drift, inversion, volatilization and the use of biotechnology traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products, could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment. These and other concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, product discontinuation, continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation, termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims. These and other concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of certain of Corteva\u2019s products, Corteva\u2019s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. As a result, such concerns could have a material adverse effect Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations may prove unfavorable.\nIn many markets there are various pressures to reduce government subsidies to farmers, which may inhibit the growth in these markets of products used in agriculture. In addition, government programs that create incentives for farmers (for example, the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard) may be modified or discontinued. However, it is difficult to predict accurately whether, and if so when, such changes will occur. Corteva expects that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the income available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and, accordingly, the operating results of the agriculture industry.\nCorteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by industrial espionage and other disruptions to its supply chain, information technology or network systems.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, local epidemics or pandemics, weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm Corteva\u2019s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. For example, a pandemic in locations where Corteva has significant operations, sales, or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s results of operations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions may also be caused by security breaches, which could include, for example, attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error or actions or other disruptions. Corteva and/or its suppliers may fail to effectively prevent, detect and recover from these or other security breaches and, as a consequence, such breaches could result in misuse of Corteva\u2019s assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance.\nLike most major corporations, Corteva is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks, from time to time. Corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. However, to date, Corteva has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events. Although management does not believe that Corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that Corteva will not suffer such losses in the future.\nCorteva actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, Corteva may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nCorteva\u2019s sales to its customers may be adversely affected should a company successfully establish an intermediary platform for the sale of Corteva\u2019s products or otherwise position itself between Corteva and its customers.\nCorteva expects its distribution model will service customers primarily through the Pioneer direct sales channel in key agricultural geographies, including the United States. In addition, Corteva expects to supplement this approach with strong retail channels, including distributors, agricultural cooperatives and dealers, and with digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize their product selection and maximize their yield and profitability. While Corteva expects the indirect channels and its digital platform will extend its reach and increase exposure of its products to other potential customers, including smaller farmers or farmers in less concentrated areas, there can be no assurance that Corteva will be successful in this regard. If a competitor were to successfully establish an intermediary platform for distribution of Corteva\u2019s products, especially with respect to Corteva\u2019s digital platform, it may disrupt Corteva\u2019s distribution model and inhibit Corteva\u2019s ability to provide a complete go-to-market strategy covering the direct, dealer and retail channels. In such a circumstance, Corteva\u2019s sales may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in Corteva\u2019s input costs, which include raw materials and production costs, could have a significant impact on Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCorteva\u2019s input costs are variable based on the costs associated with production or with raw materials Corteva uses. For example, Corteva\u2019s production costs vary, especially on a seasonal basis where changes in weather influence supply and demand. In addition, Corteva\u2019s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond Corteva\u2019s control. Corteva refers to these costs collectively as input costs. Significant variations in input costs affect Corteva\u2019s operating results from period to period.\nWhen possible, Corteva purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Corteva also enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. In addition, Corteva takes actions to offset the effects of higher input costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher input costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. If Corteva is not able to fully offset the effects of higher input costs, it could have a significant impact on its financial results.\nCorteva may be unable to achieve all the benefits that it expects to achieve from the Internal Reorganization and future restructuring and other cost savings initiatives. Combining the agriculture businesses of EID and DAS may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect Corteva\u2019s results and negatively affect the value of Corteva common stock.\nSince the Merger, Corteva has benefited from and expects to continue to benefit from significant cost synergies through the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the \u201cSynergy Program\u201d) which was designed to integrate and optimize the organization in preparation for the separation of DowDuPont\u2019s materials science business through the separation and distribution of Dow (which occurred on April 1, 2019) and the separation of DowDuPont\u2019s agriculture business through Corteva\u2019s separation and distribution (which occurred on June 1, 2019). This integration and optimization was designed to be achieved through production cost efficiencies, enhancement of the agricultural supply chain, elimination of duplicative agricultural research and development programs, optimization of Corteva\u2019s global footprint across manufacturing, sales and research and development, the reduction of corporate and leveraged services costs, and the realization of significant procurement synergies. In addition, Corteva\u2019s management also expects Corteva will achieve growth synergies and other meaningful savings and benefits as a result of Corteva\u2019s separation, as well as any future restructuring or cost savings initiatives.\nCombining EID and DAS's independent agriculture businesses and preparing for Corteva\u2019s separation and distribution were complex, costly and time-consuming processes and management may face significant challenges in implementing or realizing the expected synergies from Corteva\u2019s separation and distribution, many of which may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration or separation process, including with respect to the intended tax efficient transactions;\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating, replicating or separating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\naddressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of Corteva and the intended tax efficient separation transactions;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\nfailing to successfully optimize Corteva\u2019s facilities footprint;\n\u2022\nfailing to take advantage of Corteva\u2019s global supply chain;\n\u2022\nfailing to identify and eliminate duplicative programs; and\n\u2022\nfailing to otherwise integrate EID\u2019s or DAS\u2019s respective agriculture businesses, including their technology platforms.\nSome of these factors are outside of Corteva\u2019s control and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact Corteva\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Synergy Program or other future restructurings or cost initiatives are not realized fully or take longer to realize than expected, the value of Corteva\u2019s common stock, revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely. There can be no assurance that Corteva, as an independent, separate public company, will be able to sustain any or all the cost savings generated from actions under the Synergy Program or through future restructurings or cost initiatives.\nCorteva\u2019s liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if it is unable to raise capital through the capital markets or short-term debt borrowings.\nAny limitation on Corteva\u2019s ability to raise money in the capital markets or through short-term debt borrowings could have a substantial negative effect on Corteva\u2019s liquidity. Corteva\u2019s ability to affordably access the capital markets and/or borrow short-term debt in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of a variety of factors, including factors that are not specific to Corteva, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and, in the case of debt securities or borrowings, interest rate fluctuations. Due to the seasonality of Corteva\u2019s business and the credit programs Corteva may offer its customers, net working capital investment and corresponding debt levels will fluctuate over the course of the year.\nCorteva regularly extends credit to its customers to enable them to purchase seeds or crop protection products at the beginning of the growing season. The customer receivables may be used as collateral for short-term financing programs. Any material adverse effect upon Corteva\u2019s ability to own or sell such customer receivables, including seasonal factors that may impact the amount of customer receivables Corteva owns, may materially impact Corteva\u2019s access to capital.\nCorteva has additional agreements with financial institutions to establish programs that provide financing for select customers of Corteva\u2019s seed and crop protection products in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The programs are renewed on an annual basis. In most cases, Corteva guarantees the extension of such credit to such customers. If Corteva is unable to renew these agreements or access the debt markets to support customer financing, Corteva\u2019s sales may be negatively impacted, which could result in increased borrowing needs to fund working capital.\nCorteva\u2019s earnings, operations and business, among other things, will impact its credit ratings, costs and availability of financing. A decrease in the ratings assigned to Corteva or EID by the ratings agencies may negatively impact Corteva\u2019s access to the debt capital markets and increase Corteva\u2019s cost of borrowing and the financing of its seasonal working capital.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThere can be no assurance that Corteva or EID will maintain its current or prospective credit ratings. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on Corteva\u2019s liquidity, capital position or access to capital markets.\nCorteva\u2019s customers may be unable to pay their debts to Corteva, which could adversely affect Corteva\u2019s results.\nCorteva offers its customers financing programs with credit terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season. Due to these credit practices as well as the seasonality of Corteva\u2019s operations, Corteva may need to issue short-term debt at certain times of the year to fund its cash flow requirements. Corteva\u2019s customers may be exposed to a variety of conditions that could adversely affect their ability to pay their debts. For example, customers in economies experiencing an economic downturn or in a region experiencing adverse growing conditions may be unable to repay their obligations to Corteva, which could adversely affect Corteva\u2019s results.\nIncreases in pension and other post-employment benefit plan funding obligations may adversely affect Corteva\u2019s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nThrough Corteva's ownership of EID, Corteva maintains EID defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans. For some of these plans, including EID\u2019s principal U.S. pension plan, Corteva continues as sponsor for the entire plan regardless of whether participants, including retirees, are or were associated with EID\u2019s agriculture business. Corteva uses many assumptions in calculating its expected future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than assumed. In addition, expected future payment obligations may be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions regarding participants, including retirees. In 2020, Corteva expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, and about $240 million for its other post-employment benefit (\"OPEB\") plans. Additionally, Corteva may make potential discretionary contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2020. Corteva, furthermore, may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future, which could adversely affect Corteva\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nCorteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by environmental, litigation and other commitments and contingencies.\nAs a result of Corteva\u2019s operations, including past operations and those related to divested businesses and discontinued operations of EID, Corteva incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits. Corteva also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. In addition, Corteva maintains and periodically reviews and adjusts its accruals for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs.\nCorteva expects to continue to incur environmental operating costs since it will operate global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. These rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, which Corteva monitors closely. Corteva\u2019s policy will require that its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, Corteva expects to continue certain voluntary programs, and could consider additional voluntary actions, to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and Corteva expects these costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Over the long term, such expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and could fluctuate significantly.\nCorteva accrues for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. Corteva expects to base such estimates on several factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) at multi-party sites and the number of, and financial viability of, other PRPs. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may be materially higher than Corteva\u2019s accruals.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nCorteva faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters arising out of the normal course of its current and former business operations, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, environmental and antitrust lawsuits. Corteva has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment, including waterways and watersheds. Claims alleging harm to the public and the environment may be brought against Corteva, notwithstanding years of scientific evidence and regulatory determinations supporting the safety of crop protection products. The litigation involving Monsanto\u2019s Roundup\u00ae non-selective glyphosate containing weedkiller products has resulted in negative publicity and sentiment and may lead to similar suits with respect to glyphosate-containing products and/or other established crop protection products. Claims and allegations that Corteva\u2019s products or products that Corteva manufactures or markets on behalf of third parties are not safe could result in litigation, damage to Corteva\u2019s reputation and have a material adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to Corteva\u2019s financial results. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities. Such factors and developments may include, but are not limited to, additional data, safety or risk assessments, as well as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on Corteva.\nThe company, pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Corteva Separation Agreement, is entitled to indemnification from Chemours, Dow and DuPont, as applicable, for certain litigation, environmental, workers\u2019 compensation and other liabilities related to its historical operations. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, Corteva records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. These estimates of recovery are subject to various factors and developments that could result in differences from future estimates or the actual recovery. As of December 31, 2019, the indemnification assets pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Corteva Separation Agreement are in aggregate $120 million within accounts and notes receivable - net and $359 million within other assets in the company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any failure by, or inability to pay, these liabilities in line with the indemnification provisions of the Separation Agreements may have a material adverse effect on Corteva and its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Corteva may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations. If Corteva were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting Corteva\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCorteva\u2019s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, which could negatively affect Corteva\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCorteva\u2019s operations outside the United States are subject to risks and restrictions, including fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. In addition, Corteva\u2019s international operations are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts, local epidemics or pandemics, significant levels of crime and organized crime, or developing legal systems. This may increase the risk to the company's employees, subcontractors or other parties, and to other liabilities, such as property loss or damage to the company's products, and may affect Corteva's ability to safely operate in, or import into, or receive raw materials from these countries. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China slowed international commerce with China. While at this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact the company's results is uncertain, it may result in delays in receiving key raw materials for the company's products or decreased demand for the company's products, which may negatively impact Corteva's business.\nAdditionally, Corteva\u2019s ability to export its products and its sales outside the United States has been, and may continue to be adversely affected by significant changes in trade, tax or other policies, including the risk that other countries may retaliate through the imposition of their own trade restrictions and/or increased tariffs in response to substantial changes to U.S. trade and tax policies.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nAlthough Corteva has operations throughout the world, Corteva\u2019s sales outside the United States in 2019 were principally to customers in Brazil, Eurozone countries, and Canada. Further, Corteva\u2019s largest currency exposures are the Euro and the Brazilian Real. Market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for Corteva\u2019s products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on Corteva\u2019s results of operations. In addition, changes in exchange rates may affect Corteva\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. Corteva actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions and committed purchases.\nClimate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact Corteva\u2019s sales and earnings.\nThe agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors, which can vary unpredictably from period to period. Weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and, accordingly, can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products, including the mix of products used or the level of returns. The weather also can affect the quality, volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Seed yields can be higher or lower than planned, which could lead to higher inventory and related write-offs. Climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms, floods, heat waves, droughts and other events that could affect the quality, volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix. Climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced.\nCorteva\u2019s business may be adversely affected by the availability of counterfeit products.\nA counterfeit product is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Corteva product, therefore, is one manufactured by someone other than Corteva, but which appears to be the same as an authentic Corteva product. The prevalence of counterfeit products is a significant and growing industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit products can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual consumers; the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit products; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit products. Further, laws against counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existing laws varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit products use complex transport routes to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products.\nCorteva\u2019s global reputation makes its products prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit products pose a risk to consumer health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured (often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites) as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit products, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adversely impact Corteva\u2019s business by, among other things, causing the loss of consumer confidence in Corteva\u2019s name and in the integrity of its products, potentially resulting in lost sales and an increased threat of litigation.\nCorteva undertakes significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit products, including, among other things, working with regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of products and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters; assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy Corteva\u2019s products and easier for consumers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit products; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products; working collaboratively with wholesalers, customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors; and working with other members of an international trade association of agrochemical companies to promote initiatives to combat counterfeiting activity. No assurance can be given, however, that Corteva\u2019s efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit products may continue to increase.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact Corteva\u2019s future results.\nFrom time to time Corteva evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit Corteva\u2019s business and/or growth objectives. If Corteva is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, Corteva could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on Corteva\u2019s financial results. Corteva continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to its objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. However, Corteva may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect Corteva\u2019s earnings. Moreover, Corteva might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings. In addition, if the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact Corteva\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAn impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could require Corteva to record a significant non-cash charge and negatively impact Corteva\u2019s financial results.\nCorteva assesses both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. For the seed reporting unit, the excess fair value over carrying value is approximately 12%, and therefore carries a higher risk of impairment charges in future periods. Future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could be recorded as a non-cash charge in results of operations due to changes in assumption, estimates or circumstances and there can be no assurance that such impairments would be immaterial to Corteva.\nRisks Related to The Separation\nThe company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve from the Separation from DowDuPont.\nAs an independent, publicly-traded company, Corteva continues to, among other things, focus its financial and operational resources on its specific business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to its operational focus and strategic priorities, guide its processes and infrastructure to focus on its core strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet its specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics, all of which are benefits the company expected to achieve from its Separation. However, the company may be unable to fully achieve some or all of these benefits.\nFor example, in order to position itself for the Separation and Distribution, the company undertook a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within its operations. These actions may not provide the benefits the company expected, and could lead to disruption of operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow its businesses following the Separation and Distribution, weakening of its internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of its key customer and supplier relationships. If the company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve as an independent company, or does not achieve them in the time expected, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn connection with the Separation the company has assumed, and agreed to indemnify DuPont and Dow for, certain liabilities. If the company is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities, the company may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and its financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, DuPont and Dow will indemnify Corteva for certain liabilities. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities it incurs, and DuPont and/or Dow, and/or their historical separated businesses, may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with DuPont and Dow, the company agreed to assume, and indemnify DuPont and Dow for, certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments, as discussed further in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company\u2019s business, particularly indemnities relating to certain litigation for Historical DuPont operations or its actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Corteva Distribution.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThird parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to DuPont and Dow, including those related to DowDuPont\u2019s specialty products and/or materials science businesses, respectively, and those related to discontinued and/or divested businesses and operations of Historical Dow, which have been allocated to Dow. DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, will agree to indemnify Corteva for such liabilities, but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities. In addition, DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations with respect to the liabilities the company incurs. Even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, any amounts for which the company is held liable, the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself. Each of these risks could negatively affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the company generally has assumed and is responsible for the payment of its share of (i) certain liabilities of DowDuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of DowDuPont, (ii) certain liabilities of Historical DuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from general corporate matters of Historical DuPont and discontinued and/or divested businesses and operations of Historical DuPont, including its spin-off of Chemours, and (iii) certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to DuPont or Dow (or allocated specifically to Corteva) pursuant to the Corteva Separation Agreement, and third parties could seek to hold Corteva responsible for DuPont\u2019s or Dow\u2019s share of any such liabilities. For more information, see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. DuPont and/or Dow, as applicable, will indemnify Corteva for their share of any such liabilities; however, such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect Corteva against the full amount of such liabilities, and/or DuPont and/or Dow may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. In addition, even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from DuPont and/or Dow any amounts for which the company is held liable in excess of its agreed share, the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself and may not be able to fully insure itself to cover these risks. Each of these risks could materially affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Separation and related transactions may expose Corteva to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws\nAlthough the company received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that the company and DuPont were each adequately capitalized following the Distribution, the Separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. In connection with fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. Any unpaid creditor could claim that DuPont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Separation and Corteva Distribution, and that the Separation and Corteva Distribution left DuPont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that DuPont intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured. Additionally, under its indemnity provisions of the Separation Agreement, the company could find its liabilities increased as a result of a court concluding that Historical DuPont, Historical Dow or DowDuPont executed a fraudulent conveyance in connection with divestitures and spin-offs of any one of their historical operations, including Chemours. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Separation and Distribution as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on Corteva, which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the court could return some of Corteva\u2019s assets or shares of Corteva common stock to DuPont, provide DuPont with a claim for money damages against Corteva in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by DuPont and the fair market value of Corteva at the time of the Corteva Distribution, or require Corteva to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignment for the benefit of creditors.\nThe Distribution is also subject to review under state corporate Distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although the Distribution was made out of DowDuPont\u2019s surplus and the company received an opinion that DowDuPont has adequate surplus under Delaware law to declare the dividend of Corteva common stock in connection with the Corteva Distribution, there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the Corteva Distribution was unlawful.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nIf the Corteva Distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving Corteva common stock in the Corteva Distribution could be subject to significant tax liability.\nDowDuPont received an IRS Tax Ruling and tax opinion that, among other things, the Corteva Distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code). The IRS Ruling and tax opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from DowDuPont and Corteva, regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters. Despite the tax opinion and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the Distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion.\nIf the Corteva Distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, then a stockholder of DuPont that received shares of Corteva common stock would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares (including any fractional shares sold on behalf of such stockholder) on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of DuPont\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits, which would include any earnings and profits attributable to the gain recognized by DuPont on the taxable distribution and could include earnings and profits attributable to certain internal transactions preceding the Corteva Distribution. Any amount that exceeded DuPont\u2019s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of DuPont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a gain on the DuPont stock. In the event the Distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, DuPont would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the Distribution in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of Corteva common stock distributed to DuPont stockholders on the distribution date over DuPont\u2019s tax basis in such stock. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state, local tax and/or foreign tax law, Corteva and DuPont could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the Separation and Distributions to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be imposed on DuPont or DuPont stockholders. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that the company entered into with DuPont and Dow, subject to the exceptions described below, the company is generally obligated to indemnify DuPont against such taxes imposed on DuPont. However, if the Distributions fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the Merger and the Distributions, then under the Tax Matters Agreement, DuPont and Dow would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with their relative equity values on the first full trading day following the Dow Distribution. The company and DuPont would share any liabilities of DuPont described in the preceding sentence in accordance with its relative equity values on the first full trading day following the Corteva Distribution. Furthermore, under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on DuPont or Dow that arise from the failure of the Corteva Distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to its, or its affiliates\u2019, stock, assets or business, or any breach of its representations made in any representation letter provided to its counsel in connection with the tax opinion. DuPont and Dow will be separately responsible for any taxes imposed on Corteva that arise from the failure of the Corteva Distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to such company\u2019s or its affiliates\u2019 stock, assets or business, or any breach of such company\u2019s representations made in connection with the IRS Ruling or in the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the Corteva Distribution that cause DuPont to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Code, as discussed further below. Such tax amounts could be significant. To the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on Corteva\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe company agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions separating it from DowDuPont in the United States, which may reduce Corteva\u2019s strategic and operating flexibility.\nThe company\u2019s ability to engage in certain transactions is limited or restricted to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Distributions by DowDuPont, and certain aspects of the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignment. As a result of these limitations, under the Tax Matters Agreement that the company entered into with DuPont and Dow, for the two-year period following the Distribution, the company is prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from, among other things:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in acquisitions of a certain percentage of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndissolving, merging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nundertaking or permitting any transaction relating to Corteva stock, including issuances, redemptions or repurchases other than certain, limited, permitted issuances and repurchases;\n\u2022\naffecting the relative voting rights of Corteva stock, whether by amending Corteva\u2019s certificate of incorporation or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct its business.\nThese restrictions may significantly limit Corteva\u2019s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that the company may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business.\nThe IRS may assert that the Merger causes the Distributions and other related transactions to be taxable to DuPont, in which case the company could be subject to significant indemnification liability.\nEven if the Distributions otherwise constitutes a tax-free transaction to stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, DuPont may be required to recognize corporate level tax on the Distributions and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code if, as a result of the Merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with the Distributions, there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in DuPont or Corteva. In connection with the Merger, DowDuPont received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the proper time, manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of DowDuPont, Historical DuPont and Historical Dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under Section 355(e) of the Code as a result of the Merger. The tax opinion relied on the continued validity of the private letter ruling, as well as certain factual representations from DowDuPont as to the extent of common ownership in the stock of Historical DuPont and Historical Dow immediately prior to the Merger. Based on the representations made by DowDuPont as to the common ownership in the stock of Historical DuPont and Historical Dow immediately prior to the Merger and assuming the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, the tax opinion concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in DowDuPont, Historical DuPont or Historical Dow for purposes of Section 355(e) as a result of the Merger. Notwithstanding the tax opinion and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine that the Distributions or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to DuPont if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings of DowDuPont is not correct or that the Distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling. If DuPont is required to recognize corporate level tax on either of the Distributions and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code, then under the Tax Matters Agreement, the company may be required to indemnify DuPont and/or Dow for all or a portion of such taxes, which could be a material amount, if such taxes were the result of either direct or indirect transfers of Corteva common stock or certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the Merger and the Distributions.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\nThe company is subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of DowDuPont following the Distribution.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of DowDuPont may become Corteva\u2019s obligations either in whole or in part. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of DowDuPont\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. Additionally, to the extent that any subsidiary of Corteva was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either Historical DuPont or Historical Dow for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Merger, such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of Historical DuPont or Historical Dow, as applicable, for such taxable period. In connection with the Distributions, on April 1, 2019, the company entered into the Tax Matters Agreement with DuPont and Dow that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among Corteva, DuPont and Dow. If DuPont or Dow were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, the company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nRestrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreements limit Corteva\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services and/or prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.\nThe company is dependent to a certain extent on DuPont and Dow to maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. For example, DuPont and Dow are responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining (at their respective discretion) patents on trade secrets and know-how that they each respectively license to Corteva. They also have the first right to enforce their respective trade secrets and know-how licensed to Corteva. If DuPont or Dow, as applicable, fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents, trade secrets or know-how under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements, the company may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products and services.\nIn addition, Corteva\u2019s use of the intellectual property licensed to it under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements is restricted to certain fields, which could limit Corteva\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services. For example, the licenses granted to Corteva under the agreement will not extend to all fields of use that the company may decide to enter into in the future. These restrictions may make it more difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for Corteva to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, or may result in certain of its products or services being later to market than those of its competitors.\nNeither Corteva\u2019s financial information nor its unaudited pro forma combined financial information are necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe financial information of Corteva and the unaudited pro forma financial information included herein (refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 51) may not reflect what Corteva\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would have been had the company been an independent, publicly traded company comprised solely of DowDuPont\u2019s agriculture business during the periods presented or what its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future as an independent company. This is primarily because:\n\u2022\nThe historical financial information of Corteva does not reflect the changes that the company expects to experience in connection with the Separation, including the distribution of Historical DuPont\u2019s businesses aligned with DowDuPont\u2019s non-agriculture businesses.\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, Corteva\u2019s business was operated under the corporate umbrella of DowDuPont. As part of the DowDuPont corporate organization, Corteva\u2019s business was principally operated by Historical DuPont, with certain portions of its business being operated by Historical Dow as part of its internal corporate organization, rather than being operated as part of a consolidated agriculture business.\n\u2022\nThe historical financial information of Corteva reflects only corporate expenses of Historical DuPont and allocated corporate expenses from Historical Dow, and thus is not necessarily representative of the costs the company will incur for similar services as an independent company following the Separation and Distribution.\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, continued\n\u2022\nCorteva\u2019s business has historically principally satisfied its working capital requirements and obtained capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, as part of Historical DuPont\u2019s company-wide cash management practices, with certain portions of its business having satisfied such requirements through the practices of Historical Dow. Although these practices have historically generated sufficient cash to finance the working capital and other cash requirements of its business, following the Separation and Distribution, the company will no longer have access to Historical Dow\u2019s cash pools nor will its cash generating revenue streams mirror those of Historical DuPont and/or Historical Dow. The company may, therefore, need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements.\nIn addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this annual report is based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate, and accordingly, Corteva\u2019s unaudited pro forma financial information should not be assumed to be indicative of what the company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations actually would have been as a standalone company during the time periods presented nor to be a reliable indicator of what its financial condition or results of operations actually may be in the future. For additional information about the unaudited pro forma financial statements, Historical DuPont\u2019s past financial performance and the basis of presentation of Corteva\u2019s financial statements, see Corteva\u2019s consolidated financial statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTraditionally, the company\u2019s business was operated under the umbrella of DowDuPont\u2019s corporate organization, with portions of its businesses being integrated with the businesses of Historical DuPont and Historical Dow. This integration has historically permitted its business (or portions thereof) to enjoy economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships, both as part of the DowDuPont organization and within the Historical DuPont and Historical Dow internal corporate structures. The loss of these benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart I", "PERMNO": 18592, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "CTVA"}
