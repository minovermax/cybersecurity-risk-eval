{"cik": "1606909", "company": "Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the material risks described below, which we believe represent the material risks related to our business and our securities, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. In connection with such forward looking statements, you should also carefully review the cautionary statements referred to under \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe cyclical and volatile nature of the seaborne drybulk transportation industry may lead to decreases in charter and freight rates, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and profitability and its ability to comply with its loan covenants. The market experienced a strong fourth quarter due to higher commodity prices and negative fleet growth, but 2017 is projected to be weak given the overcapacity in tonnage.\nThe seaborne drybulk transportation industry is cyclical and volatile, and the lengthy downturn in the drybulk charter market has severely affected the entire drybulk shipping industry. There can be no assurance that drybulk charter rates will increase and rates could decline. The volatility of charter and freight rates has been due to various factors, including lower crude oil prices,\nslow economic growth of China, a strong U.S. Dollar and the associated weakening of other world currencies. Concurrently, with these factors, vessel supply continued to increase.\nAlthough our operating fleet is primarily chartered-in on a short term basis and though lower charter rates result in lower charter hire costs, low charter and freight rates in the drybulk market could have an adverse effect on our vessel values and earnings on our owned fleet, and similarly, could affect our cash flows, liquidity and ability to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreements. In addition, the decline in the drybulk carrier market has had and may continue to have additional adverse consequences for the drybulk shipping industry, including an absence of financing for vessels. Accordingly, the value of our common shares could be substantially reduced.\nBecause we employ our vessels under a mix of voyage charters and time charters and contracts of affreightment (COA\u2019s), which typically extend for varying lengths of time of from one month to ten years, we are exposed to changes in market rates for drybulk carriers and such changes may affect our earnings and the value of our owned drybulk carriers at any given time. A COA relates to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the COA holder to nominate different vessels to perform individual voyages. We may not be able to successfully employ our vessels in the future or renew existing contracts at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations. We are also exposed to volatility in the market rates we pay to charter-in vessels. Fluctuations in charter and freight rates result from changes in the supply of and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the demand for seaborne carriage of commodities. Because the factors affecting the supply of and demand for vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable.\nFactors that influence demand for vessel capacity include:\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the exploration or production of energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022\nthe location of regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe location of consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;\n\u2022\nthe globalization of production and manufacturing;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities, embargoes and strikes;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and other disruptions in international trade;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in international trade;\n\u2022\nchanges in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other regulatory developments;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nbunker (fuel) prices; and\n\u2022\nweather.\nThe factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u2022\nthe number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u2022\nport and canal congestion;\n\u2022\nthe scrapping rate of older vessels;\n\u2022\nvessel casualties;\n\u2022\nthe number of vessels that are out of service.\nIn addition to the prevailing and anticipated charter and freight rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices, costs of bunker fuels and other operating costs, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance and insurance coverage, the efficiency and age profile of the existing drybulk fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations. These factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our control, and we may not be able to correctly assess the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions.\nWe anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers and our transportation services will be dependent upon economic growth in world economies and its associated industrial production, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet and the sources and supply of drybulk cargoes to be transported by sea. Although the newbuilding orderbook is currently lower than expected, demolition dropped in the second half of 2016, which may cause the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet to increase. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could also have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAn over-supply of drybulk carrier capacity may prolong rate weakness or depress the current charter and freight rates further and, in turn, adversely affect our profitability.\nThe market supply of drybulk carriers has been increasing as a result of the delivery of numerous newbuilding orders over the last few years. Newbuildings have been delivered in significant numbers since the beginning of 2006 and vessel supply growth has been outpacing vessel demand growth, causing downward pressure on charter rates. Until the new supply is fully absorbed by the market, charter rates may continue to be under pressure due to vessel supply in the near to medium term. Although the Company typically enters into back-haul COAs to offset the large uncompensated cost of positioning vessels for front-haul voyages, if market conditions persist or worsen, upon the expiration or termination of our COAs, we may only be able to re-employ our vessels at reduced or unprofitable rates, or we may not be able to employ our vessels at all. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.\nThe market values of our owned vessels may decrease, which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow or cause us to breach certain covenants in our credit facilities and we may incur impairment or a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value.\nThe fair market values of our owned vessels have generally experienced high volatility, and you should expect the market values of our vessels to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nprevailing level of charter and freight rates;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry;\n\u2022\ntypes and sizes of vessels;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for vessels;\n\u2022\nother modes of transportation;\n\u2022\ncost of newbuildings;\n\u2022\ngovernmental and other regulations; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances.\nIn addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. If the market values of our owned vessels decrease, we may not be in compliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities secured by mortgages on our drybulk vessels unless we provide additional collateral or prepay a portion of the loan to a level where we are again in compliance with our loan covenants. At various times during 2016, we were not in compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt agreements and therefore obtained\nwaivers from the facility agents. Please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Activities.\u201d\nIn addition, if we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements, the sale proceeds may be less than the vessel\u2019s carrying value on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings.\nThe carrying amounts of vessels held and used by us are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular vessel may not be fully recoverable. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount. This assessment is made at the asset group level which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets. The asset groups are defined by vessel size and classification.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we identified a potential impairment indicator by reference to industry-wide estimated market values of all vessels of the same size range and age. As a result, we evaluated each asset group for impairment by estimating the total undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposal. At December 31, 2016, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were higher than the carrying amount of the vessels in the Company's fleet and as such, no loss on impairment was recognized.\nAt December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the m/v Nordic Barents and the m/v Nordic Bothnia were determined to be higher than their estimated undiscounted future cash flows due to the decline in market rates expected to be earned for the remaining estimated useful life of the vessels. As a result, a loss on impairment of approximately $5.4 million is included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Company has relied on financial support from its founders and investors through related party loans, which may not be available to the Company in the future.\nFrom time to time, we have obtained loans from our founders, Edward Coll, Anthony Laura, and Lagoa Investments, an entity beneficially owned by Claus Boggild, to meet vessel purchase, newbuilding deposit, and other obligations of the Company. These loans have been historically available to the Company on an as needed basis, and payable as cash flow reasonably permitted. These loans may not be available to the Company in the future. We may seek to refinance such related party loans with the net proceeds of future debt and equity offerings, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms. If we are not able to find additional sources of financing on acceptable terms, we may have to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of these loans and facilities than we would if we were able to refinance on superior terms. Even if we are able to borrow money from such parties, such borrowing could create a conflict of interest of management to the extent they also act as lenders to the Company.\nThe current state of the global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nGlobal financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. In recent years, operating businesses in the global economy have faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating international liquidity conditions, and declining markets. There has been a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it has been negatively affected by this decline.\nAlso, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase if lenders increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt, and reduce, or cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to expand or meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nOur revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect our operating results and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\nWe operate our drybulk vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in charter and freight rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results, which could affect our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. The drybulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months due to demand increases arising from agricultural harvest and increased coal demand in preparation for winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. This seasonality may adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future.\nRisks associated with operating ocean-going vessels could affect our business and reputation, which could adversely affect our revenues and price of our common shares.\nThe operation of ocean-going vessels carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:\n\u2022\nmarine disaster;\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents;\n\u2022\ncargo and property losses or damage;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022\npiracy.\nThe involvement of our vessels in an environmental disaster may harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator. Any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues.\nThe operation of drybulk carriers entails certain unique operational risks.\nThe operation of certain ship types, such as drybulk carriers, has certain unique risks. With a drybulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the ship can be a risk factor. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure. In addition, drybulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold), and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach at sea. Furthermore, any defects or flaws in the design of a drybulk carrier may contribute to vessel damage. Hull breaches in drybulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds. If a drybulk carrier suffers flooding in its holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the vessel's bulkheads, leading to the loss of the vessel. If we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels, we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. In addition, the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator.\nOur vessels may call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common shares.\nOn our charterers' instructions, notwithstanding contractual restrictions agreed with us, our vessels may call on ports or operate in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and other authorities or countries identified by the U.S. government or other authorities as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Sudan and Syria. The U.S. sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. In 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or CISADA, which amended the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, (\"ITSR\"). Among other things, CISADA introduced limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products. In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608 which prohibits foreign persons from violating or attempting to violate, or causing a violation of any sanction in effect against Iran or facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. Any persons found to be in violation of Executive Order 13608 will be deemed a foreign sanctions evader and will be banned from all contacts with the United States, including conducting business in U.S. dollars. Also in 2012, President Obama signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the\nIran Threat Reduction Act, which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the Iran Threat Reduction Act intensified existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran's petroleum or petrochemical sector. On January 16, 2015, the United States lifted the nuclear-related secondary sanctions, however, such sanctions generally are directed toward non-U.S. persons for specified conduct involving Iran that occurs entirely outside of U.S. jurisdiction.\nDuring 2014, several Executive Orders were signed which authorize and subsequently expand sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people. These sanctions put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials. Such a person could be subject to a variety of sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets, exclusion from financial transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of that person's vessels from U.S. ports for up to two years. In 2015, an Executive Order was issued against seven officials from Venezuela which blocks access to their assets and the use of U.S. financial systems. Declaring any country a threat to national security is the first step in starting a U.S. sanctions program.\nAlthough we believe that we have been in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, and intend to maintain such compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions that could severely impact our ability to access U.S. capital markets and conduct our business, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels, and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation. In addition, our reputation and the market for our securities may be adversely affected if we engage in certain other activities, such as entering into permissible charters with individuals or entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions and embargo laws that are not controlled by the governments of those countries, or engaging in permissible operations associated with those countries pursuant to contracts with third parties that are unrelated to those countries or entities controlled by their governments. Investor perception of the value of our common shares may be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries.\nWe are subject to international safety regulations and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the United Nations\u2019 International Maritime Organization\u2019s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners and ship managers to develop and maintain an extensive \u201cSafety Management System\u201d that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation for dealing with emergencies. The failure of a shipowner to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. Each of the vessels owned or operated by the Company is ISM Code-certified.\nIn addition, vessel classification societies impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels. In complying with current and future environmental requirements, vessel owners and operators may incur significant additional costs for maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental protection requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and may require us to incur significant capital expenditures to keep our vessels in compliance.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership cost and operation of our vessels. These requirements include, but are not limited to, European Union Regulations, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1975, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution of 1973, the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974, the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, the U.S. Clean Air Act, U.S. Clean Water Act, the U.S. Marine Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters.\nCompliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. We may also incur additional costs in order to\ncomply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault.\nWe are required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although we have arranged insurance to cover certain environmental risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends.\nIn order to comply with new ballast water treatment requirements, we may have to install expensive ballast water treatment systems and modify our vessels to accommodate such systems.\nThe International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships\u2019 Ballast Water and Sediments (the \u201cBWM Convention\u201d), adopted by the UN International Maritime Organization in February 2004, calls for the prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention will enter into force on September 8, 2017. In order to comply with these living organism limits, vessel owners may have to install expensive ballast water treatment systems or make port facility disposal arrangements and modify existing vessels to accommodate those systems. To date, many of these systems are unproven and not yet certified for use by any government. Adoption of the BWM Convention standards could have an adverse material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations depending on the available ballast water treatment systems and the extent to which existing vessels must be modified to accommodate such systems.\nIncreased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin, destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection procedures may result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery of our vessels and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us.\nIt is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a claimant may seek to obtain security for its claim by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the \u201csister ship\u201d theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any \u201cassociated\u201d vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could attempt to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against a vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our vessels.\nGovernments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in a loss of earnings.\nA government could requisition one or more of our vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner, while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels may negatively impact our revenues and reduce the amount of dividends, if any, in the future.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel, or bunkers, is typically the largest expense in our shipping operations for our vessels. Changes in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. When we operate vessels under COAs or voyage charters, we are responsible for all voyage costs, including bunkers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce our profitability. We continually monitor the market volatility associated with bunker prices and seek to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of marine fuels with our bunker hedging program. Increasing fuel prices resulted in mark to market adjustments of open fuel swaps in the last three quarters of 2016 and in the fourth quarter of 2015. Please see \u201cThe Company\u2019s Management and Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks - Fuel Swap Contracts.\u201d\nIn the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete successfully for time-charter vessels or for vessel employment with new entrants or established companies with greater resources and, as a result, we may be unable to employ our vessels profitably or to charter-in vessels at reasonable rates.\nWe charter-in and employ our vessels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners and operators, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for seaborne transportation of drybulk cargo by sea is intense and depends on the charter or freight rate and on the location, size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel and its operators. Due to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources are able to operate larger fleets and may be able to offer lower charter or freight rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. If we are unable to successfully compete with other drybulk shipping operators, we may be unable to retain customers or attract new customers, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLabor interruptions could disrupt our business.\nOur vessels are manned by masters, officers and crews that are contracted by our technical managers. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out normally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and on our ability to pay dividends.\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our industry.\nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, the Gulf of Guinea off the Coast of Nigeria and the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. Although the frequency of sea piracy continued to decrease during 2016, sea piracy incidents continue to occur, predominantly in Indonesia, in and around the Singapore Strait and the Gulf of Guinea. Dry bulk vessels and small tankers are particularly vulnerable to such attacks. If these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones by insurers, or Joint War Committee \u201clisted areas,\u201d premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including costs to employ onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. Furthermore, the obligations for charter hire payments and determination of on-hire days is unclear with respect to piracy. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability, of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical instability, terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct most of our operations outside of the United States, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover, we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political conflicts, including the current political instability in the Middle East, Ukraine, North Africa, North Korea and other geographic countries and areas, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. Terrorist attacks and the continuing response of the United States and others to these attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world, continues to cause uncertainty in the world's financial markets and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East,\nUkraine and North Africa, and the presence of U.S. or other armed forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and various other regions, may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in many regions around the world. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses that may result from our operations due to the inherent operational risks of the seaborne transportation industry.\nWe carry insurance to protect us against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business, including marine hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which include pollution risks, crew insurance and war risks insurance. However, we may not be adequately insured to cover all of our potential losses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims, and our insurance may be voidable by the insurers if we take, or fail to take, certain action, such as failing to maintain certification of our vessels with the applicable maritime regulatory organizations. Any significant uninsured or under-insured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to pay dividends. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future during adverse insurance market conditions.\nIn addition, we do not carry loss-of-hire insurance, which covers the loss of revenues during extended vessel off-hire periods, such as those that occur during an unscheduled drydocking due to damage to the vessel from accidents. Accordingly, any loss of a vessel or extended vessel off-hire, due to an accident or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur business strategy includes chartering-in vessels, and we may not be able to charter-in suitable vessels.\nOur business strategy depends, in large part, on our ability to charter-in vessels. If we are not able to find suitable vessels to charter-in, or to charter-in vessels at what we deem to be a reasonable rate, we may not be able to operate profitably or perform our contractual obligations. As a result, we may need to adjust our business strategy, and we may experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we charter in a vessel and shipping rates were to subsequently decrease or we were unable to secure employment for that vessel, our obligation under the charter to pay above-market rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and cash flow, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe expect to derive a significant part of our revenue and cash flow from a relatively small number of repeat customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top two customers accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, one customer accounted for 13% of our revenues. If one or more of our significant customers is unable to perform under one or more charters or COAs with us and we are not able to find a replacement charter or COA, or if a customer exercises certain rights to terminate the charter or COA, we could suffer a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution as dividends to our shareholders.\nWe could lose a customer or the benefits of a charter or COA if, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe customer fails to make charter payments because of its financial inability, disagreements with us or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nthe customer terminates the charter because we do not perform in accordance with such charter and do not cure such failures within a specified period.\nIf we lose a key customer, we may be unable to obtain replacement charters or COAs on comparable terms or at all. The loss of any of our customers, COAs, charters or vessels, or a decline in payments under our agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOn February 8, 2016, the party to one of the Company\u2019s COAs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The entity was subsequently acquired by a new entity that has agreed to honor the COA under its existing terms. This customer accounted for 11% of total revenue in 2016 and 13% of total revenue in 2015. The contract employs two owned vessels and one time-chartered vessel on a continuous basis and extends through 2020.\nWe are a holding company, and depend on the ability of our subsidiaries, through which we operate our business, to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations or to make dividend payments.\nWe are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. The equity interests in our vessel-owning subsidiaries represent a significant portion of our operating assets. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate profits available for distribution to us and, to the extent that they are unable to generate profits, we will be unable to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to certain risks with counterparties on contracts and the failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business and ability to comply with covenants in our loan agreements.\nWe enter into various contracts that are material to the operation of our business, including COAs, time charters and voyage charters under which we employ our vessels, and charter agreements under which we charter-in vessels. We also enter into loan agreements and hedging agreements, such as interest rate swap agreements, bunker swap agreements, and forward freight agreements, or FFAs. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the drybulk shipping industry, the overall financial condition of our counterparty, prevailing prices for drybulk cargoes, rates received for specific types of vessels and voyages, and various expenses. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need us to carry a cargo that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain carriage at a lower rate. If our customers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our agreements, it may be difficult to secure suitable substitute employment for the vessel, and any new charter arrangements we secure may be at lower rates or, if our counterparties fail to deliver a vessel we have agreed to charter-in, or if a counterparty otherwise fails to honor its obligations to us under a contract, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends to holders of our common shares in the amounts anticipated or at all and compliance with covenants in our secured loan agreements.\nAdditionally, we are subject to certain risks as a result of using our vessels as collateral. If we are in breach of financial covenants contained in our loan agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining waivers and amendments. If our indebtedness is accelerated, it may be difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels if our lenders foreclose on their liens. Please see \u201c- We may be unable to comply with covenants in our credit facilities or any future financial obligations that impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\u201d\nWe may be unable to comply with covenants in our credit facilities or any future financial obligations that impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facilities, which are secured by mortgages on our vessels, impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us, mainly to ensure that the market value of the mortgaged vessel under the applicable credit facility does not fall below a certain percentage of the outstanding amount of the loan, which we refer to as the collateral maintenance or loan to value ratio. In addition, certain of our credit facilities include other financial covenants, which require us to, among other things, maintain:\n\u2022\na consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 200%;\n\u2022\na consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than 120%;\n\u2022\nMinimum consolidated net worth of $45 million plus, with respect to any vessel purchased or leased by the Guarantor or its subsidiaries, for so long as such vessels are legally or economically owned, 25% of the purchase price or (finance) lease amount of such vessels;\n\u2022\nconsolidated minimum liquidity of not less than $16 million plus $1 million for each additional vessel we acquire\nIn general, the operating restrictions that are contained in our credit facilities may prohibit or otherwise limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\neffect changes in management of our vessels;\n\u2022\nsell or dispose of any of our assets, including our vessels;\n\u2022\ndeclare and pay dividends;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmortgage our vessels; and\n\u2022\nincur and pay management fees or commissions.\nNon-compliance with any of our financial covenants or operating restrictions contained in our credit facilities may constitute an event of default under our credit facilities, which, unless cured within the grace period set forth under the applicable credit facility, if applicable, or waived or modified by our lenders, provides our lenders with the right to, among other things, require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, increase our interest payments, pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance, sell vessels in our fleet, reclassify our indebtedness as current liabilities, accelerate our indebtedness, or foreclose their liens on our vessels and the other assets securing the credit facilities, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in not in compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt agreements and had to obtain waivers from the facility agents. Please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Activities.\u201d\nFurthermore, certain of our credit facilities contain a cross-default provision that may be triggered by a default under one of our other credit facilities. A cross-default provision means that a default on one loan would result in a default on certain other loans. Because of the presence of cross-default provisions in certain of our credit facilities, the refusal of any one lender under our credit facilities to grant or extend a waiver could result in certain of our indebtedness being accelerated. If our secured indebtedness is accelerated in full or in part, it would be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels and other assets securing our credit facilities if our lenders foreclose their liens, which would adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nMoreover, in connection with any waivers of or amendments to our credit facilities that we may obtain, our lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us or modify the terms of our existing credit facilities. These restrictions may further restrict our ability to, among other things, pay dividends, make capital expenditures or incur additional indebtedness, including through the issuance of guarantees. In addition, our lenders may require the payment of additional fees, require prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness and increase the interest rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness. For more information, please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Activities.\u201d\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our growth strategy.\nOne of our principal business strategies is to continue to expand capacity and flexibility by increasing our owned fleet as we secure additional demand for our services. Our growth strategy will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control. These factors include our ability to:\n\u2022\nenter into new contracts for the transportation of cargoes;\n\u2022\nlocate and acquire suitable vessels for acquisitions at attractive prices;\n\u2022\nobtain required financing for our existing and new operations;\n\u2022\nintegrate any acquired vessels successfully with our existing operations, including obtaining any approvals and qualifications necessary to operate vessels that we acquire;\n\u2022\nenhance our customer base;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain qualified personnel and crew to manage and operate our growing business and fleet;\n\u2022\nidentify additional new markets; and\n\u2022\nimprove our operating, financial and accounting systems and controls.\nWe may undertake future financings to finance our growth. Our failure to effectively identify, purchase, develop and integrate any vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The number of employees that perform services for us and our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet, and we may not be able to effectively hire more employees or adequately improve those systems. Finally, acquisitions may require additional equity issuances or debt issuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower our available cash. If any such events occur, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nGrowing any business presents numerous risks such as difficulty in obtaining additional qualified personnel and managing relationships with customers and suppliers. The expansion of our fleet may impose significant additional responsibilities on our management and staff, and may necessitate that we increase the number of personnel. We cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with our future growth.\nInvestment in Forward Freight Agreements and other derivative instruments could result in losses.\nWe manage our market exposure using forward freight agreements, or FFAs, and other derivative instruments, such as bunker hedging contracts and interest rate swap agreements. FFAs are cash-settled derivative contracts based on future freight delivery rates and other derivative instruments. FFAs may be used to hedge exposure to the charter markets by providing for the purchase or sale of a contracted charter rate along a specified route or combination of routes and over a specified period of time. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the settlement rate, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days in the specified period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. If we take positions in FFAs and do not correctly anticipate rate movements for the specified vessel route or routes and relevant time period or our assumptions regarding the relative relationships of certain vessels\u2019 earnings, routes and other factors relevant to the FFA markets are incorrect, we could suffer losses in settling or terminating our FFAs. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such hedges will qualify for special hedge accounting and, as such, our use of such derivatives may lead to material fluctuations in our results of operations.\nWe also seek to manage our exposure to volatility in the market price of bunkers and interest rate fluctuations by entering into bunker hedging contracts and interest rate swap agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully limit our risks, leaving us exposed to unprofitable contracts and we may suffer significant losses from these hedging activities.\nOur long-term COAs, single charter bookings and time-charter agreements may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results, which may adversely affect our liquidity, as well as our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we enter into long-term COAs, single charter bookings and time-charter agreements. We evaluate entering into long-term positions based on the expected return over the full term of the contract. However, long-term contracts that we believe provide attractive returns over their full term may produce losses over portions of the contract period. We may be required to provide additional margin collateral in connection with FFA positions that are settled through clearinghouses, depending upon movements in the FFA markets. These interim losses, fluctuations in our quarterly results or incremental collateral requirements may adversely affect our financial liquidity, as well as our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nWe depend on COAs, which could require us to operate at unfavorable rates for a certain amount of time or subject us to other operating risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from COAs. While COAs provide a relatively stable and predictable source of revenue, they typically fix the rate we are paid for our drybulk shipping services. Once we have entered into a COA, if we have not correctly anticipated vessel rates, location and availability for our owned or chartered-in fleet to fulfill the COA, we could suffer losses. Moreover, factors beyond our control may cause the rates we are paid under that COA to become unprofitable. Nevertheless, we would be obligated to continue to perform at these rates for the term of the COA. In addition, factors beyond our control, such as vessel availability, port delays or congestion, changes in government or industry rules or regulation, industrial actions or acts of terrorism or war, could affect our ability to perform our obligations under our COAs, which could result in breach of contract or other claims by our COA counterparties. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Securities Act of 1934, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Such exemptions may be available until our public float exceeds $75 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. Investors may find our common shares and the price of our common shares less attractive because we rely, or may rely, on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and the price of our common shares may be more volatile.\nObligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, and we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nWe will continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including Sarbanes-Oxley, and requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. These requirements and rules may place a strain on our systems and resources. For example, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources and will cause us to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we had not previously incurred. The expenses incurred by public companies, generally, for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing and the costs we will incur for such purposes may strain our resources. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, divert management's attention to ensure compliance and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. In addition, our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. Our incremental general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded corporation will include costs associated with reports to shareholders, tax returns, investor relations, registrar and transfer agent\u2019s fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur, the timing of such costs or the degree of impact that our management\u2019s attention to these matters will have on our business. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common shares, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, although as a smaller reporting company, we will be exempt from certain of its requirements for so long as we remain as such. For example, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we and our independent auditors report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, as a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement. Once we are no longer a smaller reporting company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management, however, is not exempt from this requirement, and is required to, among other things, maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow us to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required.\nA failure to pass inspection by classification societies could result in one or more vessels being unemployable unless and until they pass inspection, resulting in a loss of revenues from such vessels for that period and a corresponding decrease in earnings.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention. Our owned fleet is currently enrolled with Bureau Veritas (BV), DNV GL Group (DNV), and Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NK).\nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel\u2019s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Our\nvessels are on special survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel must undergo regulatory surveys of its underwater parts every 30 to 60 months.\nIf a vessel fails any annual survey, intermediate survey or special survey, the vessel may be unable to trade between ports and, therefore, would be unemployable, potentially causing a negative impact on our revenues due to the loss of revenues from such vessel until it was able to trade again.\nIf we purchase and operate secondhand vessels, we may be exposed to increased operating costs which could adversely affect our earnings and, as our fleet ages, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\nAs part of our current business strategy to increase our owned fleet, we may acquire new and secondhand vessels. While we typically inspect secondhand vessels prior to purchase, this does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Even if we physically inspect a secondhand vessel, an inspection does not provide us with the same knowledge about its condition that we would have if the vessel had been operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects or other problems with secondhand vessels prior to purchase or charter, or may incur costs to terminate a purchase agreement. Any such hidden defects or problems, when detected, may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties.\nIn general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers.\nFurthermore, governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations, or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage. As our vessels age, market conditions may not justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives.\nUnless we set aside reserves or are able to borrow funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet at the end of their useful lives.\nWe estimate the useful life of most of our vessels to be 25 years to 30 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. The remaining estimated useful lives of our fleet range from 4 to 25 years, depending on the type of vessel and market conditions. The average age of our owned drybulk carriers at the time of this filing is approximately 9 years. A portion of our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by employing our vessels. If we are unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives, our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends could be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain reserves for vessel replacements. We intend to finance vessel replacements from internally generated cash flow, borrowings under our credit facilities or additional equity or debt offerings.\nOur ability to obtain additional debt financing, or refinance any existing indebtedness, may be dependent on the performance and length of our COAs and charters and the creditworthiness of our contract counterparties.\nThe performance and length of our COAs and charters and the actual or perceived credit quality of our contract counterparties, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources required to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all may materially affect our results of operations and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe intend to partially finance acquisitions of vessels with borrowings drawn under credit facilities. While we may refinance amounts drawn under our credit facilities with the net proceeds of future debt and equity offerings, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are not able to refinance these amounts with the net proceeds of debt and equity offerings at an interest rate or on terms acceptable to us or at all, we will have to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of this indebtedness. If we are not able to satisfy these obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans. The actual or perceived credit quality of our contract counterparties, any defaults by them and the market value of our fleet, among other things, may materially affect our ability to obtain alternative financing. In addition, debt service payments under our credit facilities or alternative financing may limit funds otherwise available for working capital, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends and other purposes. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, or if we otherwise default under our credit facilities or alternative financing arrangements, our lenders could declare the debt, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on our fleet,\nwhich could result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have at such time and the commencement of similar foreclosure proceedings by other lenders.\nWe depend on our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other key employees, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, knowledge, skill, reputations and business contacts of our Chief Executive Officer, Edward Coll, our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Laura, our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Filanowski and other key employees including Claus Boggild, Mads Boye Petersen, Peter Koken, Robert Seward, Fotis Doussopoulos, and Gianni Del Signore. Accordingly, our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers. We may experience departures of senior executive officers and other key employees, and we cannot predict the impact that any of their departures would have on our ability to achieve our financial objectives. The loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation, arbitration and other proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business\nWe may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, or otherwise. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, securities, or maritime matters. The potential costs to resolve any claim or other litigation matter, or a combination of these, may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting our claims or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management's attention to these matters.\nUnited States tax authorities could treat us as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d which could have adverse United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of \u201cpassive income\u201d or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of \u201cpassive income.\u201d For purposes of these tests, \u201cpassive income\u201d includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute \u201cpassive income.\u201d United States shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous United States federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC.\nBased on our proposed method of operation, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute \u201cpassive income,\u201d and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets.\nThere is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.\nIf the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our United States shareholders will face adverse United States tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders), such shareholders would be liable to pay United States federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder\u2019s holding period of our common shares.\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings\nUnder sections 863(c)(3) and 887(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the \u201cCode,\u201d 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States may be subject to a 4% United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations recently promulgated thereunder.\nWe expect that we and each of our subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax exemption and we will take this position for United States federal income tax return reporting purposes. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption and thereby become subject to United States federal income tax on our United States source income. Due to the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances on our tax-exempt status or that of any of our subsidiaries.\nIf we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to exemption under Code section 883 for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries could be subject for those years to an effective 2% United States federal income tax on the shipping income these companies derive during the year that are attributable to the transport of cargoes to or from the United States. The imposition of this taxation would have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe have had and in the future may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements\nOur management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company has been a public reporting company since October 1, 2014. Prior to that, we did not have a sufficient number of accounting personnel or adequate systems to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. We and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we made significant improvements to our internal controls and remediated the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified in 2014. While these measures correct the material weaknesses identified, we cannot assure that there will not be other material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will identify. If additional material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered in the future, they may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information timely and accurately.\nRisks Related To Our Common Shares\nFuture sales of our common shares could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.\nThe market price of our common shares could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market, including sales of shares by our large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common shares.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all or which may dilute our common shares or adversely affect its market price.\nWe may require additional capital to expand our business and increase revenues, add liquidity in response to negative economic conditions, meet unexpected liquidity needs caused by industry volatility or uncertainty and reduce our outstanding indebtedness under our existing facilities. To the extent that our existing capital and borrowing capabilities are insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings, including offerings of our common shares, securities convertible into our common shares, or rights to acquire our common shares, or curtail our growth and reduce our assets or restructure arrangements with existing security holders. Any equity or debt financing, or additional borrowings, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders, as described further below, and the securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements.\nFuture issuances of our common shares could dilute our shareholders\u2019 interests in our company.\nWe may, from time to time, issue additional common shares to support our growth strategy, reduce debt or provide us with capital for other purposes that our Board of Directors believes to be in our best interest. To the extent that an existing shareholder does not purchase additional shares that we may issue, that shareholder\u2019s interest in our company will be diluted, which means that its percentage of ownership in our company will be reduced. Following such a reduction, that shareholder\u2019s common shares would represent a smaller percentage of the vote in our Board of Directors\u2019 elections and other shareholder decisions.\nVolatility in the market price and trading volume of our common shares could adversely impact the trading price of our common shares.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market factors may materially reduce the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common shares, which has experienced significant price fluctuations in the past twelve months, could continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described herein or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability.\nClassified Board of Directors.\nOur Board of Directors are divided into three classes of directors serving staggered, three-year terms beginning upon the expiration of the initial term for each class. This classified board provision could discourage a third party from making a tender offer for our shares or attempting to obtain control of us. It could also delay shareholders who do not agree with the policies of our Board of Directors from removing a majority of our Board of Directors for up to two years.\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda and it may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us.\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda and substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, one of our directors is a non-resident of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such director\u2019s assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to serve process within the United States. upon us or our directors and executive officers, or to enforce a judgment against us for civil liabilities in United States courts.\nIn addition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we are incorporated or where our assets are located would enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against us based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable United States federal and state securities laws or would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us based on those laws.\nBecause we are a foreign corporation, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a U.S. corporation may have.\nWe are a Bermuda exempted company. Our memorandum of association and bye-laws and the Companies Act, 1981 of Bermuda, or the Companies Act, govern our affairs. The Companies Act does not as clearly establish your rights and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors as do statutes and judicial precedent in some United States jurisdictions. Therefore, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests as a shareholder in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction. There is a statutory remedy under Section 111 of the Companies Act which provides that a shareholder may seek redress in the courts as long as such shareholder can establish that our affairs are being conducted, or have been conducted, in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders, including such shareholder. However, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a United States corporation may have.", "PERMNO": 14353, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "PANL"}
