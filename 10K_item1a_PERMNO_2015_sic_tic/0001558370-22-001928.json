{"cik": "314489", "company": "FIRST BUSEY CORP /NV/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights the risks management believes could adversely affect our financial performance. Additional possible risks that could affect the Company adversely and cannot be predicted may arise at any time. Other risks that are immaterial at this time may also have an adverse impact on our future financial condition.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create disruptions that affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect business operations, financial condition, credit quality, and results of operations will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic. The direct or indirect impact on employees, customers, counterparties, and service providers, as well as other market participants, is likely to continue through 2022 as the world attempts to gain control over the virus and emerging variants. The impact that the virus continues to have on global markets, the economy, business restrictions, and employment is ongoing as a projected return to pre-pandemic operating conditions is unknown.\nIn the past year, the U.S. economy began to rebound from severe disruptions caused by the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. Economic conditions have begun to normalize with the availability of vaccines and treatments, increasing workforce employment and participation, the lessening of business and education restrictions, and demand for services beginning to return. The financial conditions of households and businesses was bolstered significantly by government stimulus, which contributed to the economic recovery but also brought about growing pains as evidenced by supply chain problems and rising prices. Although current economic conditions are more favorable than the prior year, the outlook for continued growth is characterized by elevated uncertainty with potential for unevenness across markets and sectors. Although household and business credit and liquidity is strong currently, further pandemic-related disruptions could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans; declines in assets under management, affecting wealth management revenues; negative impacts on regional economic conditions resulting in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability; and impacts on the implementation of our growth strategy. While the recovery this past year has been strong, the pace of growth in the U.S. and globally could decline as a result of rising inflation, higher interest rates, the pervasiveness of supply chain challenges across industries, and the persistence of the virus in variant forms.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 will continue for some time and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity, and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, nor are there historical indicators to rely on in terms of how markets will react, and as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nConditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the states in which it operates, generally may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates and, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois; suburban Chicago, Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area; central Indiana; and southwest Florida. Economic conditions within Busey\u2019s markets were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and although conditions have improved this past year, elevated unemployment, economic decline, on-going business restrictions and operational uncertainty continue to impact the markets overall, and in particular, certain industry sectors. The financial condition of the State of Illinois, in which the largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base resides, is characterized with low credit ratings, pension under-funding, budget deficits, and lower job growth rates than most of the country; furthermore, Illinois was one of three states in the country to lose population in the last decade. Notably, with the recent improvement in the state\u2019s financial outlook, during the second half of 2021 Illinois received improved ratings from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch. The Company operates in markets with significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state and federal funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government-sponsored entities, as well as potential federal changes to healthcare laws, could affect the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which could in turn adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The partial shutdown of colleges and universities across the state may also impact businesses heavily reliant on the colleges and universities for revenue generation. Recent downturns in local operating markets where banking operations occur could result in a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures, and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values.\nMarket volatility and changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and the revenue that the Company earns from net interest income, as earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the FOMC. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. In addition, a rise in interest rates could result in decreased demand for first mortgages as well as mortgage refinancing, activities which have historically contributed to a significant portion of the Company\u2019s mortgage revenue. Furthermore, if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investment securities, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Finally, when interest rates rise, competition for deposits often increases, which can lead to a change in the Company\u2019s funding mix and cost of funding. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700.0 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced the interest it pays on excess reserves. The prolonged reduction in interest rates is likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our net interest income and margins and our profitability. The impact of the prolonged low rates will also continue to affect rate spreads and return on earning assets.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management business may also be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions and the conditions in the financial and securities markets, which could affect the values of assets under care. Management contracts generally provide for fees payable for wealth management services based on the market value of assets under care. Because most of the Company\u2019s contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, declines in securities prices may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations from this business. Market declines and reductions in the value of customers\u2019 wealth management accounts, could also result in the loss of wealth management customers, including those who are also banking customers.\nThe Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin to increase rates, taper its quantitative easing program, and reduce its balance sheet of bonds and other assets in 2022, but will do so with the goal of avoiding abrupt or unpredictable changes in economic or financial conditions so as not to disrupt the financial systems, also known as \u201cshocks;\u201d despite this, the impact of these changes cannot be certain. Vulnerabilities in the financial system can amplify the impact of an initial shock following rate increases, potentially leading to unintended volatility, as well to disruptions in the provision of financial services, such as clearing payments, the provision of liquidity, and the availability of credit. Furthermore, asset liquidation pressures can be amplified by liquidity mismatches and the leverage of certain nonbank financial intermediaries such as hedge funds. The financial crisis in March 2020 also demonstrated that pressures on dealer intermediation can limit the availability of liquidity during times of market stress. Given the interconnectedness of the global financial system, these vulnerabilities could impact the Company\u2019s business operations and financial condition.\nThe transition to an alternative reference rate could cause instability and have a negative effect on financial market conditions.\nLIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. End dates for LIBOR have now been set, and U.S. Regulators have issued guidance as of October 2021 that urges market participants to address their existing LIBOR exposures and transition to robust and sustainable alternative rates by December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee has proposed that SOFR is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR, but has also advised market participants to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of any alternative reference rates being considered for use.\nContracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties. Although the Company has actively worked to plan for the transition away from LIBOR, the transition is both complex and challenging and the downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact financial markets and individual institutions. If the Company\u2019s selected alternative rate is based on a small transaction volume, it could be susceptible to volatility and disruption during times of market stress. Furthermore, if the Company fails to properly address legacy contracts by adding robust fallback positions, it will be exposed to interest rate risks and potential loss of yields. Finally, if the Company or other market participants fail to properly plan to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR, it could have an adverse effect on the Company and the financial system as a whole. In 2021, we began the transition to SOFR and other interest rate benchmarks in anticipation of the cessation of the publication of LIBOR.\nContinued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. has recently experienced elevated levels of inflation, with the consumer price index climbing approximately 7.0% in 2021. Continued levels of inflation could have complex effects on our business and results of operations, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, if interest rates were to rise in response to, or as a result of, elevated levels of inflation, the value of our securities portfolio would be negatively impacted. In addition, while we generally expect any inflation-related increases in our interest expense to be offset by increases in our interest revenue, inflation-driven increases in our levels of non-interest expense could negatively impact our results of operations. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also cause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and our clients\u2019 ability to repay indebtedness. It is also possible that governmental responses to the current inflation environment could adversely affect our business, such as changes to monetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the imposition or threatened imposition of price controls. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.\nLabor shortages and failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, decreased labor force size and participation rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, expanded unemployment benefits offered in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other government actions. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive local labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain employees.\nIn addition, if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition, or results of operations.\nLaws, regulations, rules, policies, and regulatory interpretations governing the Company continue to evolve and will likely continue to change over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The 2021 change of the presidential administration and Congressional control has prompted new or revitalized financial services regulation. The extent and scope of potential financial regulations is hard to predict, but continued changes are expected to occur as leadership and priorities in various regulatory bodies shifts.\nImplementation of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and enter into acquisition and merger agreements, and could expose the Company to additional expense, including increased compliance costs. Appointments to the primary banking regulatory agencies affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Executive orders, future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThese rule and regulatory changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources so as to make necessary changes to operations in order to comply. In addition to the expense and uncertainty related to increased regulation, the financial services industry in recent years has faced more intense scrutiny from regulatory agencies in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices; fee-based products and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering laws, and the USA PATRIOT Act, which focuses on money laundering in the form of terrorist financing. Federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to financial services\u2019 regulators including, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound practices. If the Company were the subject of an enforcement action, it could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nAs the Company continues to grow in asset size and complexity, regulatory expectations and scrutiny will likely increase and could have a potential impact on the Company\u2019s operations and business.\nThe Company has grown steadily over the past several years, increasing size through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As financial institutions grow, so do the expectations of regulatory agencies regarding the financial institution\u2019s ability to control for increasingly complex and sophisticated business operations. Certain regulations and laws have embedded asset thresholds that change regulatory expectations, have different financial statement impacts, require different committee and management compositions, or enhance certain reporting requirements. For example, as further discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section, the Dodd-Frank Act included a number of requirements that trigger when a banking entity crosses over $10.0 billion in assets. The Company anticipated crossing the $10.0 billion threshold for some time, and it did so in 2020.\nOn November 20, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced an Interim Final Rule, providing temporary relief for certain community banking organizations related to certain regulations and reporting requirements as a result of growth in size from the COVID-19 response. The Company has been provided temporary relief under this rule with respect to the interchange revenue impacts of the Durbin Amendment. The Company did not reduce its asset size back below the $10.0 billion threshold and has instead increased assets to $12.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. The relief expired December 31, 2021, and as a result, regulatory expectations, scrutiny, and reporting requirements are expected to continue to increase, and may affect the Company\u2019s operations and strategies.\nLaws impacting cannabis-related businesses in Illinois and other states may have an impact on the Company\u2019s operations and risk profile.\nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. Starting January 1, 2020, however, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act began permitting adults to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use from licensed dispensaries. It is Busey Bank\u2019s current practice to avoid knowingly providing banking products or services to entities or individuals that: (i) directly or indirectly manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana or hemp products, or those with a significant financial interest in such entities; or (ii) derive a material amount of revenue from providing products or services to, or other involvement with, such entities. Busey Bank is taking reasonable measures, including appropriate new account screening and customer due diligence measures, to ensure that existing and potential customers that operate in the states in which the Bank operates do not engage in any such activities. Nonetheless, shifts in Illinois law legalizing cannabis use, along with shifts in Missouri and Florida law allowing medicinal use and decriminalizing possession, have increased the number of direct and indirect cannabis-related businesses in some of the states in which the Company operates, and therefore increases the likelihood that Busey Bank could interact with such businesses, as well as their owners and employees. Such interactions could create additional legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risk to Busey Bank and the Company.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nHeightened credit risk associated with lending activities may result in insufficient loan loss provisions, which could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from economic and market conditions. The Company attempts to reduce its credit risk through loan application approval procedures, monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and geographic locations, and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments as well as external parties. However, while such procedures help reduce risks, they cannot be expected to completely eliminate the Company\u2019s credit risks. Borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans for any of a variety of reasons resulting in a rise in the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, delinquencies, and/or a need for increases in the provision for loan losses. When economic conditions decline or significant shifts in demand change, as they have during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in non-performing loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies become more likely.\nThe Company estimates and establishes reserves for credit losses and maintains them at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable credit losses based on a continual analysis of the Company\u2019s portfolio and market environment. These reserves represent the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and are based upon other relevant information available.\nIn 2016, the FASB published CECL, which requires recording loss estimates for the life of the instrument for loans, a change from the 40-year standard in which losses are recorded under the \u201cincurred loss\u201d concept. Adoption of CECL in 2020 resulted in additional reserves being set aside to protect against future credit losses. Although management believes the reserves are adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, management cannot guarantee that additional provisions for credit losses will not be required in the future.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s non-performing assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund non-performing assets, it does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting its income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration costs increase, and the Company\u2019s efficiency ratio is adversely affected. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which, when compared to the outstanding balance of the loan, may result in a loss. Non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase the Company\u2019s risk profile and the capital its regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. Although it is hard to fully predict the affect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s asset quality, it\u2019s performance may be adversely affected if it experiences increases in non-performing loans and non-performing assets in the future.\nFederal regulatory agencies, in consultation with FASB, issued updated guidance on March 22, 2020, for classifying loans as TDRs, which allowed banks to modify loans of customers stressed by COVID-19 without having to classify the loan as a TDR. While this updated guidance provided temporary relief for both borrowers and banks, these loan modifications may not be sufficient to keep the assets the Company holds from deteriorating if the duration of the pandemic is prolonged.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.\nThe Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or geographic location of the borrower or collateral. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is made up of commercial, commercial real estate, and retail real estate loans. Thus, deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values could result in higher credit costs and losses to the Company. The global pandemic in 2020 significantly impacted both global and domestic markets and economies as shutdowns and restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus affected several different business sectors. Although many business sectors rebounded as restrictions lifted during 2021, the full impact of the shutdowns and restrictions, along with the effect of changing demands resulting from the pandemic cannot be known at this time. The Company has taken additional steps to quantify the potential risk and impacted industries that are likely to experience stress to cash flows and pose higher potential default risk.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, which the Company requires whenever appropriate on commercial loans. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial loan, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loans are collateralized by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity generally, and in markets in which the Company has banking operations, could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan which would result in losses.\nReal estate construction, land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nConstruction, land acquisition, and development loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project, and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company\u2019s appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, there may be inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that it will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while it attempts to dispose of it.\nCredit risk associated with concentration of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists, in part, of securities issued by government or government sponsored agencies and non-government entities. A downturn in the financial condition of the issuers, the performance of the underlying collateral, or the financial condition of the individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities could create results such as rating agency downgrades of the securities and default by issuers or individual mortgagors. Any of the foregoing factors could result in realized losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nThe Company is required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether as a result of losses, inability to raise additional capital, or otherwise, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance would be adversely affected.\nFirst Busey and Busey Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If it fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of the amounts necessary to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, its ability to grow, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders on outstanding stock, its ability to make acquisitions, and its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, under FDIC rules, if the Company ceases to meet the requirements to be considered a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew, or rollover deposits, particularly brokered deposits, may be restricted.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company\u2019s primary sources of funds consist of deposits and funds from sales of investment securities, investment maturities and sales, and cash from operations. Additional liquidity is available through repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities or on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect it directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. These and other factors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions with other financial institutions and lead to market-wide liquidity problems, loss of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence, which could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Although the Company is not currently experiencing liquidity stress, pandemic-related market conditions remain uncertain. Any decline in available funding and/or capital could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, pay dividends to its stockholders, or meet deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect the Company.\nAs indicated in the \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Economic and Market Risks\u201d section above, the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. The Company could experience growth as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks or government-sponsored financial institutions, which would increase its funding needs.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst coverage of us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services, which could harm its business.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois; suburban Chicago, Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area; central Indiana; and southwest Florida. In addition, the Company currently offers fiduciary and wealth management services, which account for a significant portion of its non-interest income. Many competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and wealth management services within the Company\u2019s market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks, and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and online lenders, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in the Company\u2019s market areas. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks or financial technology companies, as well as other large technology corporations, to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, customers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds, can apply for and receive credit, and can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans, deposits, and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, it may be unable to grow its loan and deposit portfolios or its wealth management commissions, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled by new and emerging technologies and/or other market forces may outpace the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to both reduce costs and service customers beyond the bank\u2019s traditional branch footprint. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Ultimately, if we fall behind in our ability to be adaptive and innovative, attracting new customers and sustaining customer loyalty and retention may be increasingly difficult as a result of evolving customer preferences and/or demographic shifts in our existing customer base.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution, and operational risks that could negatively affect us.\nTo help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings, part of our strategy is to supplement organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions in our market areas and in nearby markets. As our capital position and asset quality allow, we may continue to supplement organic growth through acquisitions, as we have in the past. There are risks associated with acquisition strategies, including the following:\n\u25cf We are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices our management considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future in one or more markets.\n\u25cf The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures, and personnel of the acquired entity in order to make the transaction economically feasible. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. Furthermore, the integration of personnel can be challenging and the likelihood of turnover of personnel from acquired institutions presents potential risks to both operational efficiency as well as customer retention. The Company may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u25cf We are subject to due diligence expenses which may not result in an acquisition.\n\u25cf To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issue capital stock to the sellers in an acquisition or to third-parties to raise capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\n\u25cf The time period in which anticipated benefits of a merger are fully realized may take longer than anticipated, or we may be unsuccessful in realizing the anticipated benefits from mergers and future acquisitions.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products, services, or delivery channels within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are either highly competitive or, conversely, not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nFinancial statements are created, in part, by estimates and assumptions and methods used by management, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Certain accounting policies are critical and require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.\nOne such assumption and estimate is the valuation analysis of its goodwill and other intangible assets. Although the Company\u2019s analysis does not indicate impairments exist, the Company is required to perform additional impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in further impairment charges. Any future goodwill or other intangible assets impairment charges, based on the current balances or future balances arising out of acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations by reducing net income or increasing net losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines.\nPeriodically, agencies such as the FASB or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s Financial Statements. These changes are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring and the implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law and may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws at national or state levels could have an effect on the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term earnings. Tax law changes are both difficult to predict and are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Changes in tax laws could affect the Company\u2019s earnings as well as its customers\u2019 financial positions, or both.\nDeferred tax assets are designed to reduce subsequent period\u2019s income tax expense and arise, in part, as a result of net loss carry-overs, and other book accounting to tax accounting differences including expected credit losses, stock-based compensation, and deferred compensation. Such items are recorded as assets when it is anticipated the tax consequences will be recorded in future periods. A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is unlikely the future tax effects will be realized. Significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain is required to record a deferred tax asset and establish a valuation allowance.\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income based on management forecasts and tax planning strategies that may be available to us. While the Company has determined that no valuation allowance is currently required for any deferred tax assets, if future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, it may need to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nFurther, the Company\u2019s investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and other community revitalization projects. The Company\u2019s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. The Company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credit and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The ultimate realization of the tax credits and other tax benefits depends upon having sufficient taxable income and on many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. It has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, compliance risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations. Risks may exist, or emerge in the future, that have not been appropriately identified or anticipated. As it continues to grow, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and manage the risks it faces is an important factor that can significantly impact results. If its risk management framework is not commensurate with its risk profile, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third-parties, and certain failures of such systems or error by employees or customers could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to conduct the Company\u2019s business, as it uses such systems to manage customer transactions and relationships, the general ledger, and deposits, loans, and investments. However, the computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems as operations are dependent upon the protection of computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security events.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain processing functions to third-party providers. If third-party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions may be affected and business operations may be adversely impacted. If third-party providers are unable to meet service expectations, experience system or processing failure, or incur disruptions affecting operations, results could adversely impact the Company. While the Company follows certain due diligence procedures in reviewing and vetting its third-parties, it cannot control their actions.\nAlthough the Company has procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such occurrences, technology-related disruptions, failures, and cybersecurity risks are a constant threat, both for the Company and for the third-parties it works with. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. Any failure, interruption in, or breach in security of, its computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of its customers engaging in internet banking activities or electronic funds transfers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the Company is reliant upon its employees. Such dependencies create risks for potential losses resulting from employee errors, breakdowns in process or control, failures to properly execute change management, negligence, or a number of other factors outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud, and other disruptions which might impact its business. In addition, the Company\u2019s Internal Audit department routinely reviews operations and high-risk areas for error, deficient controls, and failure to adhere to policy.\nPotential legal actions, fines, and civil money penalties could arise as results of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nA breach in the security of the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company.\nAlthough the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade systems and processes designed to protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets, these measures do not provide absolute security. In the past year, a myriad of industries and institutions have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, and other means. In addition, cyber attackers have taken advantage of the pandemic to create campaigns to leverage individuals fears and uncertainties as well as capitalize on the increased number of transactions occurring on digital channels. The implementation of remote working arrangements that use virtual private networks, virtual conferencing services, and telecommunication technologies can increase insider risk, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and other operational exposures. Industry trends in ransomware, phishing, and other intrusion methods have increased significantly and will continue to pose increased risk.\nThreats to security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-parties, their personnel, and their use of subcontractors. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Such cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time. An inability by our third-party providers, and their third-party providers, known as \u201csupply chain risk,\u201d to anticipate, detect,\nor adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card, debit card and other payment-related transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third-parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks, and its processors. Cyber-attacks or other breaches, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in breach and fraud-related losses as well as increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nPenetration or circumvention of the Company\u2019s security systems could result in serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers or employees, or damage to computers or systems of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties. Such events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which would adversely affect the Company.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions globally as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies, including mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the sophistication and activities of malicious individuals and organizations have increased substantially. Despite the Company\u2019s significant investment in security resources and its continued efforts to prevent or limit the effects of potential threats, it is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security incidents.\nCustomer or employee misconduct or fraud may affect operations, result in significant financial loss, and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nMisconduct by employees and customers could include hiding unauthorized activities, conducting improper or unauthorized activities, or improper use of confidential information. Customer or other outsiders may also attempt to perpetuate fraud or scams in the form of identity theft, money laundering, fraudulent or altered deposits, or use of counterfeit instruments, as a few examples. The Company also faces fraud risk associated with the origination of loans, including the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to it by customers or by third-parties. Customers may expose the Company to certain fraud risks associated with the compromise of their computing systems or accounts, as well.\nBoth the number and sophistication level of attempted fraudulent transactions are increasing. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence of fraud, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings and legislation imposing new compensation restrictions could adversely affect its ability to do so.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s success and growth has been influenced by its ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market areas. The Company\u2019s ability to retain executive officers, current management teams, lending and retail banking officers, and administrative staff of its subsidiaries continues to be important to the successful implementation of its strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to retain key personnel at acquired financial institutions is vitally important to the Company\u2019s strategy to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Also critical is the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain diverse and qualified staff with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about its market areas so as to implement its community-based operating strategy. Recent changes in labor market conditions have contributed to heightened levels of employee attrition and increased competition for talent, which has in turn driven wage rates higher and may contribute to an increase in operating expenses. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nDamage resulting from negative publicity could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors, and employees is contingent upon maintaining trust. Negative public opinion could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in a number of activities, including, but not limited to, employee misconduct, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or to treat customers fairly, faulty lending practices, compliance failures, security breaches, corporate governance, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, failure to comply with laws or regulations, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. The results of such actual or alleged misconduct could include customer dissatisfaction, inability to attract potential acquisition prospects, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. No assurance can be made, despite the cost or efforts made by the Company to address the issues arising from reputational harm, that results could not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, geopolitical risks and acts of terrorism or war, widespread disease or pandemics, as is currently being experienced, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Climate change, in particular, presents multi-faceted risks including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on our and our customers\u2019 facilities and other assets; credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change.\nClimate change exposes the Company to physical risk as its effects may lead to more frequent shifts in weather patterns and more extreme weather events that could damage, destroy, or otherwise impact the value or productivity of our properties and other assets; reduce the availability of insurance to cover losses; and/or disrupt our operations through prolonged outages. Such events and long-term shifts may also have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or collateral values, and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact, which could have a broader impact on the economy, supply chains, and distribution networks.\nFurthermore, banking regulators and other supervisory authorities, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, we face regulatory risk of increasing focus on our resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.", "PERMNO": 86382, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BUSE"}
