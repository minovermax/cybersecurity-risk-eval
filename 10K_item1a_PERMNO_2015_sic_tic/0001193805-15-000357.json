RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this filing, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. See also \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Web and Network Cybersecurity Technology Business\nFinjan\u2019s limited operating history following its 2009 asset sale makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects.\nFollowing the sale of Finjan\u2019s sales, marketing and certain other assets in 2009, Finjan\u2019s business has consisted primarily of the licensing and enforcement activities described under \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Since 2009, Finjan has generated significant, but sporadic cash flows and net income through its licensing and enforcement activities. Finjan has a limited track record, as a stand-alone entity, in executing its business plan which includes, among other things, acquiring, prosecuting, licensing, litigating or otherwise monetizing patent assets. Finjan\u2019s limited operating history, as a stand-alone entity, in its current line of business makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. There is a significant risk that we will not be able to implement or execute our current business plan, or demonstrate that our business plan is sound.\nWe are presently reliant exclusively on a limited number of patented technologies that we own through Finjan.\nWe derive substantially all of our income from a relatively small number of patented technologies. As of December 31, 2014, our assets consisted primarily of 22 U.S. and 11 international patents that we continue to monetize. Finjan\u2019s current U.S. issued patents expire at various times from 2017 through 2032, and it currently has five U.S. patent applications and six international patent applications pending as of the date of the filling. As new technological advances occur, many of the patented technologies we own through Finjan may become obsolete before they are completely monetized. If we are unable to monetize our current patent assets for any reason, including obsolescence of our technologies, the expiration of our patents or any other reason, we may be unable to acquire additional assets. If this occurs, our business and prospects would be materially harmed.\nAny failure to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights could materially impair our business.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business depends largely on the validity and enforceability of our patents and the relevance of our patent rights to commercially viable products or services. Third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential, not infringed or a combination of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patent claims will be applicable to any particular product or service. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) could invalidate or render unenforceable our patents or materially narrow the scope of the patent claims during the course of USPTO post-grant proceedings such as, for example, re-examinations or Inter Partes Reviews (\u201cIPRs\u201d). Any significant adverse finding by the USPTO or adverse verdict of a court (including, for example, the adverse verdict rendered in the 2010 Litigation) as to the validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents and/or any successful design around certain of our patents could materially and adversely affect our ability to secure future settlements or licenses on favorable terms, if at all, and otherwise harm our business.\nUnder the American Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d), patents previously granted by the USPTO may be reviewed through post-patent grant proceedings such as reexaminations or Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPRs\u201d). The basic characteristics of ex parte reexamination are: the patent owner or a third party may request the USPTO to reexamine an issued U.S. patent based on patents and printed publications that the requester submits for the USPTO\u2019s consideration. The requester must establish that the submitted prior art establishes a substantial and new question of patentability, in which event the USPTO will grant the request and order reexamination of the patent at issue. Unless the requester is the patent owner, the requester\u2019s participation terminates and only the patent owner may proceed. The patent owner can appeal the final decision of the Central Reexamination Unit (\u201cCRU\u201d) of the USPTO to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d), and may further appeal a negative decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cCAFC\u201d).\nGenerally, the grounds on which a petition for IPR is granted is whether the claimed invention is patentable strictly in light of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. The petitioner must demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that he/she/it will prevail as to at least one of the patent claims challenged to trigger the IPR. The PTAB decides on petitions and can reject them if the prior art is the same or substantially the same prior art or arguments previously presented to the USPTO. If the petition is granted, an IPR is statutorily required to be completed within one year of institution, which is extendable for up to six months for good cause. Unlike reexaminations, the third party petitioner may stay involved in the proceedings. IPRs are handled at the outset by the PTAB and do not go through the CRU of the USPTO. Final decisions of the PTAB are immediately appealable to the CAFC, either by the patent owner or the third party.\nIt is becoming a trend, if not a practice, for accused infringers to petition for reexaminations or IPRs of asserted patents as these proceedings may give the petitioner \u201ctwo bites at the apple\u201d. Parties to our enforcement actions may initiate IPRs with respect to our patents in the future. Although we believe our patents are patentable in light of prior art, these proceedings are new and unpredictable. The outcome of the proceedings can range from decisions favorable to the patent holder, favorable to both parties, or favorable to the petitioner. If the outcome is the latter, the value of the challenged patent can be materially reduced or extinguished.\nIn addition, we will likely be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of our issued patents by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO as well as prosecuting our patent applications and any patent applications we may acquire in the future.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or where competitors may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThe process of engaging a potential licensee to adopt a license can be lengthy and may not always result in a license agreement. It may take many months or longer to identify potential licensees, prepare marketing, technical or other materials, educate potential licensees on the benefits of entering into a license and agree, if at all, to licensing terms, conditions and price. Even after expending significant time and resources into licensing efforts, we may be unsuccessful in entering into a licensing agreement with a potential licensee. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins, if at all.\nWe expect to be involved in costly, time-consuming and uncertain litigation and administrative actions to enforce our patents, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nIf we believe a third party is infringing one or more of our patents and refuses to obtain a license to use our patented technologies, we may be compelled to commence legal or administrative action against those third parties. Patent litigation, like all litigations, is inherently risky, the outcome is uncertain and we cannot predict the outcome of any future litigation or administrative action. Moreover, many of the parties we believe infringe our patents are large and well-funded companies with substantially greater resources than we have and may devote substantial resources toward avoiding or limiting liability and the amount of associated damages for infringing our patents. We could also face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature, validity, enforceability or infringement of our patents. Regardless of whether legal action is successful, legal and expert fees and other costs associated with enforcement action have been, and may continue to be, significant.\nOur cash flows are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition or the market price for our common stock.\nThe amount and timing of cash flows from our licensing and enforcement activities are subject to uncertainties stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the growth rates of our licensees, the outcome of enforcement actions and certain other factors. As such, our income and cash flows may vary significantly from period to period, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our annual or quarterly results to fall below market expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur cash flows and income have been derived from a limited number of sources.\nOur net income in recent years has been derived from a limited number of settlements and license agreements, and we expect that, in the near term, any income that we generate will be derived from a limited number of sources. In 2012, we derived approximately $77.4 million of other income from two settlements. In 2013, we did not generate any income from our web and endpoint cybersecurity technology segment other than a $1.0 million installment on a license agreement entered into in connection with a 2012 settlement agreement. In 2014, we derived approximately $5.0 million of income from a single license agreement and additional $1.0 million other income installment on a license agreement entered into in connection with a 2012 settlement agreement. If we are unable to identify other third parties who use our technologies, our future income and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to identify sources of new technology, our growth strategy may fail.\nWe do not currently invent new technologies or products and our growth strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify technologies, patent portfolios, and other business acquisition candidates. To date, other than our Merger, neither we nor Finjan has engaged in any material acquisitions of technology or intellectual property assets from unaffiliated third parties. If we are unable to establish and maintain relationships within our industry, we may not be able to identify new technology-based opportunities for sustainable revenues and growth. Even if we are successful in establishing relationships with sources of technology, those relationships may not provide the volume or quality of technology and/or intellectual property assets necessary to sustain our licensing and enforcement business. If we are unable to identify and establish meaningful relationships with sources of technology and intellectual property our growth strategy may fail.\nWe may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition.\nOur growth strategy includes the potential acquisition of patent, technology or other business assets or companies to further diversity our assets and business operations. We may not be successful in identifying or funding acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy or in completing such acquisitions. Acquisitions of patent, technology or other business assets or companies are subject to numerous potential risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of a specific acquisition;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel from an acquired company, if necessary;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration process;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. Depending upon the nature and structure of future acquisitions, our stockholders may not have the ability to vote on, or consent to, the consummation of any such acquisition.\nAny technologies we acquire in the future, if any, may not be commercially successful.\nWe may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies may be untested and subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which such patents and technologies are adopted in products and services. These technologies may require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire will have value that can be monetized.\nFailures in our due diligence and/or inaccuracies of representations and warranties made by third parties may expose us to material liabilities, write-downs or write-offs in the future.\nWe expect to conduct due diligence investigations of the patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies we seek to acquire in the future. Due diligence is time consuming and expensive and, at times, we may also rely on opinions or representations or warranties of third parties to supplement, replace or support our own independent due diligence. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on particular patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that affect the acquisition. If our diligence fails to identify issues related to the applicable patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies or industry to which they relate, or opinions, representations or warranties prove to be inaccurate, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, we may acquire patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nOur acquisitions of technology and patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies may be time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and may be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These costs could adversely affect our operating results, and if we incur losses, the value of our securities could decline.\nIt may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts that we are owed under licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose revenues.\nWe anticipate that the terms of license agreements may require licensees to document their use of our technologies and report related data to us on a periodic basis. Although license terms may give us the right to audit books and records of licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive and time consuming, and may not be cost-effective based on our understanding of a licensee\u2019s business. Furthermore, any license compliance program that we establish to audit certain licensees in order to review the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports may not be effective to ensure we receive royalties to which we are entitled.\nWe depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.\nOur future success depends largely upon the continued contributions of our directors, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, and other skills. The loss of members of our management or key personnel, many of whom have held their positions for a relatively short period of time, could adversely affect our business. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and the ability to identify and acquire technologies and patent assets. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements, acquire new technologies or otherwise meet our strategic objectives.\nThe success of our web and network cybersecurity technology business depends in part upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel to represent us in patent enforcement litigation and our ability to manage the costs of such services.\nThe success of our licensing and enforcement business depends upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel to advise us and manage our enforcement and litigation activities and our ability to manage the costs of such services. As our licensing and enforcement actions increase, it may become more difficult to find the best legal counsel to handle our active litigation cases, as conflicts prevent them from representing us. We may also underestimate the cost of legal counsel and related activities, in relation to the value of the enforcement activity.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions, a court may rule that we have violated certain statutory, regulatory, federal, local or governing rules or standards, which may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with licensing and enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may claim and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or our subsidiaries or award attorney\u2019s fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if we or our subsidiaries are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nSince patent disputes involving infringement, validity, and enforceability are governed by federal law, our patent enforcement actions are decided within the federal court system. The federal court calendars are often congested with other civil and criminal proceedings, giving rise to the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions. Such delays may have a negative impact on resolution of our disputes and, therefore, have a negative impact on our business.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nOur business plan includes the possible acquisition of patent applications pending before the USPTO. The value of any patent application we acquire will be dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could materially delay the process by which the USPTO issues patents and consequently any income that may be derived for the technologies claimed in the patent application. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nCompetition for patent rights and patent portfolios is intense.\nWe expect to encounter significant competition in the area of technology and intellectual property acquisitions. This includes a growing number of competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire.\nWe also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than us as well as more experience operating in our industry.\nThe markets served by our web and network cybersecurity technologies are subject to rapid technological change, and if we are unable to acquire new technologies and patents, our ability to generate income could be substantially impaired.\nThe markets served by our web and network cybersecurity technologies and our licensees frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Web and network cybersecurity products are based on continually evolving industry standards. This will require continued efforts and success in acquiring new patent portfolios with licensing and enforcement opportunities. If we are unable to acquire new patented technologies and patent portfolios, or to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards, our ability to generate income could be substantially impaired and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to support our present business plan and our anticipated business growth, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, which would adversely affect our ability to operate.\nBased on our current operating plans, our current resources are expected to be sufficient to fund our planned operations at least for the coming twelve months. We may nonetheless seek to raise additional financing if our board of directors determines that it is advisable to do so. We may also need to raise additional funds in connection with any acquisitions of technology or intellectual property assets that we pursue or to fund licensing and enforcement actions.\nWhile we may need to seek additional funding, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our business plans.\nOur public company disclosure obligations may have unintended adverse consequences on our licensing and patent enforcement strategy.\nWe are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements of applicable U.S. securities laws and are subject to the NASDAQ\u2019s disclosure rules. In order to comply with such laws and rules, we may be required to disclose certain information that may be detrimental to our current or future licensing and enforcement programs. In addition, our disclosure obligations may adversely affect our ability to enter into license or settlement agreements with third parties who are reluctant to have the monetary value and terms of such agreements publicly disclosed. To the extent permitted by applicable law and rules, we may incur additional costs and expenses seeking confidential treatment of certain information reflected in our license or settlement agreements.\nNew legislation, regulations, executive orders, or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our income.\nIf new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the USPTO or the courts or if the President of the United States issues executive orders that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our expenses and income. For example, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement or limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims could negatively impact our income derived from such enforcement actions. Similarly, recent judicial decisions relating to fee shifting in patent infringement actions and limitations relating to software patents may make patent licensing and enforcement activities more difficult and costly, though it is unclear what the precise impact of these judicial decisions will be.\nIn September 2013, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it is planning to gather information from approximately 25 companies that are in the business of buying and asserting patents in order to develop a better understanding of how those companies do business and impact innovation and competition. Both the Federal Trade Commission and European Commission are actively considering what the appropriate restrictions are on the ability of owners of patents declared to technical standards to receive both injunctions and royalties.\nFurthermore, U.S. patent laws have been amended by the America Invents Act, certain sections of which became effective in September 2011. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the AIA changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought individually against parties allegedly infringing by their respective allegations of infringement. It remains unclear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our enforcement business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the U.S. Department of Justice could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurthermore, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages a patent licensing company such as us might be entitled to. Any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines that could make our existing or future patent portfolios less valuable or more costly to enforce.\nOn April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision, Octane Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 (2014), relaxing the standard for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in patent cases. Attorneys\u2019 fees may now be awarded to a prevailing party in any patent case that \u201cstands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s litigation position \u2026 or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated\u201d. Although we are committed to litigating our patent cases in the court room with the highest standard of professional conduct and on the merits of our claims, litigation is both risky and unpredictable. We, therefore, cannot guarantee that we will prevail in our litigations or that we will not be ordered to pay the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be substantial.\nOn June 19, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in which it significantly tightened the standard for patentability of software patents. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that if you have an idea so abstract that it cannot be patented, simply tying it to a \u201cgeneric computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court further stated that tying the abstract idea to \u201cpurely functional and generic\u201d hardware would, similarly, not make the idea patentable. Arguably, the Alice decision is intended to limit the validity of poor quality software patents. The Alice decision may provide accused infringers of software patents new arguments to challenge the validity of such patents. Practically, the effects of the Alice decision are still being assessed as patent holders, attorneys, the USPTO, and courts, are coping to determine the proper bounds of the Alice decision. We cannot guarantee that the Alice decision and ensuing developments will not have a negative impact on our business.\nFurther, and in general, it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facility, computer systems and personnel, which are primarily located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Bay Area is in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones. Our facility and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires, floods and similar events. Should earthquakes or other catastrophes such as fires, floods, power outages, communication failures or similar events disable our facilities, we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business, which stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results. Acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities and on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe incur legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company. Prior to the Merger, Finjan was a private company and not subject to these expenses. While we were a public company (as Converted Organic Inc.) subject to these costs prior to completing the Merger, the costs associated with being a public company are not reflected in our historical financial statements because Finjan was the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and, as such, our historical financial statements are those of Finjan. We will need to devote time and financial resources to compliance programs, investor relations activities, financial reporting obligations and other activities relevant to being a public company. The costs associated with these activities, as well as any diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may have a material adverse effect on our future business. In light of these costs and the changes in our management, business and growth strategy that resulted from the Merger, the public company costs that we incurred prior to the Merger may not be indicative of the costs we will incur in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. We have experienced material weaknesses in the past and we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. Any weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, inability to timely file periodic reports, a decline in our stock price and investor confidence, or other material effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and others who beneficially own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and their affiliates, together with others who own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, beneficially own or control approximately 66% of our common stock. Accordingly, these persons, acting individually or as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the market value of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nFuture sales by us or our existing shareholders could dilute our stockholders and depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we sell additional common stock or securities that are convertible into common stock, in the future, the market price of our common stock could decline. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, including the issuance of 2,224,980 shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock units 945,012 of which were vested as of December 31, 2014, could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and voting interests in the Company and increase the number of shares of our common stock eligible for resale in the public market.\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not continue, and the price of our stock may be volatile and may decline in value.\nThere currently is only limited trading in our common stock. An active trading market may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares of common stock at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities traded in those markets. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nMarket prices for public companies whose principle revenues are derived from the licensing of intellectual property have been particularly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, and the factors include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\ndevelopments in relationships with licensees;\n\u2022\nour or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments in our patent enforcement actions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patents;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 expectations of our financial results;\n\u2022\na change in financial estimates or securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u2022\nchanges in management\u2019s or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments and court decisions that negatively impact the ability of patent owners to protect their assets.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nThe SEC has adopted regulations, which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock may be less than $5.00 per share and therefore may be a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to sell shares of our common stock in the future.\nOur shareholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of eighty million (80,000,000) shares of common stock and ten million (10,000,000) shares of blank check preferred stock. If we engage in capital raising activities in the future, including issuances of common stock or securities that are convertible into, or exercisable for, our common stock, to fund the growth of our business, our shareholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock. We have adopted an equity incentive plan pursuant to which equity awards may be granted to eligible employees (including our executive officers), directors and consultants, if our board of directors determines that it is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to do so. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of any such equity awards may result in dilution to our shareholders and adversely affect our earnings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain analyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we could lose, or never gain, visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of our company difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to establish classes or series of preferred stock with such rights, privileges and preferences as our board determines (i.e., \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock), including rights that may be senior to those of our common stockholders, which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors with staggered terms, which could delay or otherwise make it more difficult for an outsider to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent or calling a special meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board of directors or to vote to repeal any of the antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation provides that directors may only be removed for cause by a supermajority vote of our stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nour bylaws contain advance notice provisions with respect to nominees for election to our board of directors.\nIf we issue shares of preferred stock, investments in common stock could be diluted or subordinated to the rights of the holders of preferred stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to establish classes or series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. Although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which such stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then-market price of such stock. Presently, our board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to the issuance of currently authorized preferred stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules. Although we have no plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to adopt any new series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock, any such action by our board of directors or issuance of preferred stock by us could dilute your investment in our common stock and warrants or subordinate your holdings to such shares of preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 91893, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "FNJN"}
