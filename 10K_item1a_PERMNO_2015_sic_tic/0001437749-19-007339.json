{"cik": "946486", "company": "WINDTREE THERAPEUTICS INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and any of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The following risks, among others, could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or industry results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements contained herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In such case, the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Capital Resource Requirements\nAs of April 5, 2019, we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our research and development programs, support our business operations and satisfy existing obligations on a timely basis through October 2019. If we do not secure additional capital to support our future activities before our existing cash resources are exhausted, we likely will be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 million and available-for-sale, marketable securities of $13.9 million, current liabilities of $20.6 million, including $8.0 million of Loan payable. Although we believe that the December 2018 merger with CVie and $39 million Private Placement Financing has improved our financial position and may better position us to raise the capital needed to fund our business plans, we expect to continue to incur significant losses and require significant additional capital to advance our istaroxime and AEROSURF\u00ae clinical development programs, support our operations and business development efforts, and satisfy existing obligations. As of April 5, 2019, we believe that we will have sufficient resources (including marketable securities) to support our development activities and business operations through October 2019.\nWe have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital, to fund our research and development programs, support our business operations and pay our existing obligations on a timely basis. We plan to seek the additional capital that we require from potential strategic alliances, collaboration arrangements and other similar transactions, and through potential public and private offerings in the equity markets. If none of these alternatives is available, or if available, we are unable to raise sufficient capital through such transactions, we likely will not have sufficient cash resources and liquidity to fund our business operations, which could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise the required capital, we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and, ultimately, cease operations.\nOur existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and if we are unable to meet our debt obligations, including with respect to any collateral requirements, the lenders could foreclose on our assets or seek a judgment against us and execute against our assets.\nWe currently have loans in the amount of $3.5 million from an affiliate of Lee\u2019s, which is payable on various dates through November 2019, and $4.5 million from O-Bank Co., Ltd in Taiwan that is secured by a pledge of collateral from an affiliate of Lee\u2019s. We do not have a written agreement requiring Lee\u2019s to maintain the collateral for the term of the loan.\nOur debt obligations:\n\u2022\ncould impair our liquidity;\n\u2022\ncould make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate cash flow to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our ability to incur other indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, and could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on us with respect to our ability to license our products in the US and other markets around the world;\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to enter into strategic transactions, public or private equity offerings, and similar agreements, or require us to obtain the consent to enter into such transactions;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets; and\n\u2022\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors.\nShould we fail to pay our obligations, fail to comply with any covenants contained in any related agreements, including the collateral maintenance agreement under the O-Bank loan, or if Lee\u2019s withdraws its pledge of collateral to secure the O-Bank loan, we could be in default regarding that indebtedness and the lender could accelerate payment of the outstanding indebtedness. Moreover, in the future, to secure our obligations under any loans, we may be required to grant to the lender a security interest in some or substantially all of our assets.\nWe will continue to require significant additional capital to support our research and development activities and operations, and our ability to raise such capital may be impacted by factors impairing or blocking our access to the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and that would result in an increased cost of capital. Moreover, any equity financings that we undertake could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nUntil we are in a position where revenues from commercialization of our product candidates are sufficient to offset our cash requirements, we will continue to require significant additional infusions of capital to execute our business strategy. For the next several years, we do not expect that any of our products will be approved or that we will receive revenues from the sale of approved products, and our cash outflows for development programs, operations and debt service are likely to far outpace the rate at which we may generate revenues and other cash inflows from all available sources.\nWe plan to seek the additional capital that we require from potential strategic alliances, collaboration arrangements and other similar transactions, and through potential public and private offerings in the equity markets, which could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. In such event, the issuance, or even potential issuance, of shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. However, a number of factors, including without limitation the planned timing and outcomes of our clinical activities, our debt obligations, our status as a smaller reporting company under the SEC regulations, our delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market in May 2017 and subsequent transfer to the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQB\u00ae market, as well as conditions in the global financial markets generally, may present significant challenges to accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and at an increased cost of capital. We do not have in place arrangements to obtain additional capital. Any financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests. In any such event, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial performance and stock price and could delay new product development and clinical trial plans.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, curtail or discontinue our research and development programs.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock, could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell shares of preferred stock or common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then-current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time. Any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. If we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction, stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with a public or private financing, in connection with our compensation programs, and upon exercise of outstanding warrants will have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance, or even potential issuance, of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe exercise of stock options and other securities could also cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution. Moreover, holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them, if ever, at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants. Such exercises, or the possibility of such exercises, may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly. It may also reduce the price of our common stock.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock will be subordinate to our creditors in a liquidation. No assurance can be given as to the amount of assets, if any, that would be available for common stockholders in the event of a liquidation.\nIn liquidation, the rights of equity security holders like our common stockholders are subordinate to holders of our debt obligations. Accordingly, in the event of liquidation, no assurance can be given as to the amount of remaining assets, if any, available for payment to common stockholders.\nThe market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, has been and is likely to be volatile. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant patient adverse reactions to our products;\n\u2022\ngovernmental approvals, delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the US or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development;\n\u2022\nchanges in the US or foreign political environment and the passage of laws, including tax, environmental or other laws, affecting the product development business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights, including any third-party challenges of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries; including healthcare reform in the US and pricing and reimbursement policies globally;\n\u2022\nnew accounting standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in executive management; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any of the risks described in these Risk Factors or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other public filings.\nOur common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB\u00ae market tier operated by The OTC Markets since May 5, 2017. The price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to remain, volatile. The average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly and we have experienced extended periods where the trading volume has been low. The instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry. Even if securities class actions that may be filed against us in the future were ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful, they would involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe will require significant additional capital to support our research and development activities and operations and may not have sufficient cash resources in the future to pay our vendors, service providers and pay other business expenses. While we seek to raise the additional capital that we require, our relationships with important vendors and service providers may be affected. If any of our key vendors and service providers were to cease working with us or subject the delivery of products or services to timing or payment preconditions, our development activities may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe have from time to time experienced periods in which our cash resources have been constrained. As such, it is our practice to routinely closely monitor and control our cash resources to assure that investment and spending decisions advance our corporate objectives at any time. To manage our cash, we tightly control purchasing and retention of consultants, closely monitor the release of funds and may defer payment on invoices to conserve cash. This practice of conserving cash may adversely impact our relationships with key vendors and service providers and the pace at which we are able to advance our programs. While we are working closely with our vendors and service providers to preserve our key relationships, there can be no assurance that we will be successful and that our vendor and service providers will continue to work with us, particularly during a period of constrained cash resources. Failure to retain such key relationships could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business and operations.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded on our balance sheet, related to our acquisition of CVie Therapeutics, which may lead to potentially significant impairment charges.\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in estimates and circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable based on the existence of certain triggering events. Intangible assets and goodwill are also subject to an impairment assessment at least annually. The amount of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet has increased significantly because of the acquisition of CVie Therapeutics. The identifiable intangible assets resulting from the CVie Therapeutics acquisition relate to in-process research and development of istaroxime and rostafuroxin. At December 31, 2018, intangible assets and goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $77.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively.\nIf long-lived assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we would be required to record a potentially significant write-off, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Development Activities\nOur clinical development programs involve risks and uncertainties that are inherent in clinical development. Our clinical trials may be delayed, or fail, which will harm our business prospects.\nTo gain marketing authorization for our product candidates, we will need to successfully complete our clinical trials, including pivotal phase 3 clinical development programs. Such development programs generally take years to complete and may be delayed by a number of factors. We may not reach agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or a foreign regulator on the extent of our phase 3 program, the design of any one or more of the clinical trials necessary for approval, or we may be unable to reach agreement on a single design that would permit us to conduct a common pivotal phase 3 clinical development program in all markets of interest. Conditions imposed by the FDA and foreign regulators on our clinical development program could significantly increase the time required to complete, and the costs of conducting, and the risks associated with clinical trials. For example, we may not be able to design a study that is acceptable to both the FDA and EMA regulators, which would cause us to limit the scope of our geographical activities or greatly increase our investment. Additionally, we may seek to conduct development activities in competitive clinical locations and therapeutic areas, or design clinical trials with complex requirements, which could adversely affect the rate of enrollment, and our ability to complete our development activities may be impaired and, in turn, require more time and money. Even if we obtain promising preliminary findings or results in earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may suffer significant delays or setbacks in any stage of our clinical trials. Any delay in the results from our clinical trials could force us to make unplanned changes to our clinical trial plan, which could adversely affect the results and potentially impair our ability to secure additional capital to fund our continued development program. Even if we complete the clinical trial within our anticipated time, if our results are inconclusive or non-compelling or otherwise insufficient to support a strategic or financing transaction, we potentially could be forced to limit or cease our development activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe timing and completion of clinical trials to study our product candidates depend on many factors, including the rate at which patients are enrolled. Delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials would likely result in increased costs, program delays, or both. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including potentially:\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe existence of competing clinical trials;\n\u2022 the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe existence of alternative available products;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility and enrollment criteria for the study;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients (or premature infants\u2019 parents or guardians) to participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe trial complexity and resources required by a clinical study site to participate;\n\u2022\navailability of clinical supplies and materials;\n\u2022 the existence of alternative available products; and\n\u2022\ngeographical and geopolitical considerations.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development process include:\n\u2022\nthe ability to design a clinical trial that will assure demonstration of improved efficacy over that of a comparator in the primary endpoint of a trial and demonstration of an adequate safety profile;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third-party clinical trial consultants and third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to successfully carry out their activities or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nour ability to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our complex and diverse clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third-party clinical supply organizations (CSO) to timely perform their obligations to assist us in storing, shipping and tracking the drug product, medical devices and other materials that are required for us to conduct our clinical trial in the US and international sites;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop and manufacture our APIs, drug products, medical devices and product candidates in a manner that ensures that they will perform as intended;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our clinical trials may be interrupted, delayed or halted because of health and safety concerns (such as patient side effects) or because of matters related to the design of the study or drug availability; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that clinical trial design and size is inadequate to assure demonstration of efficacy and meet statistical significance in outcomes, due to variation between clinicians, medical sites and countries in medical practices and procedures associated with treating our targeted diseases.\nMoreover, because AEROSURF is a combination drug/device product, the success of our clinical trial is highly dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and manufacture our ADS and our synthetic lyophilized KL4 surfactant. If our phase 3 ADS should fail to perform as designed in our phase 3 clinical program, such failures could adversely affect the results of our clinical development program.\nIn addition, if for any reason, we abandon or materially limit, geographically or otherwise, our development plans related to drug product candidates, including istaroxime or rostafuroxin, such actions may result in impairment of any related intangible asset and goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is uncertain. We may not obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize our products.\nBefore we can market our products, we must receive regulatory approvals for each product. The FDA and foreign regulators, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), extensively and rigorously regulate the testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of drug products. This approval process includes (i) preclinical studies and clinical trials of each drug product candidate to establish its safety and effectiveness, and (ii) confirmation by the FDA and foreign regulators that we maintain good laboratory and manufacturing practices during testing and manufacturing.\nNo assurance can be given that our clinical trials will be concluded successfully. Moreover, success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. As a result, data we obtain from our phase 2 clinical trials may not accurately predict phase 3 trial results, whether due to differences in sample size, study arms, duration, endpoints, other factors or, in the case of AEROSURF, features of the ADS used. We are currently planning to conduct an AEROSURF bridging study to transition in the clinic from the ADS used in the phase 2 clinical program to the phase 3 ADS. In addition, clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in gaining regulatory approval for our products.\nClinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects or raise safety or other concerns that may significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval, result in significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in the approved label, adversely affect placement within the treatment paradigm, or otherwise significantly diminish the commercial potential of the product candidate. Also, positive clinical results may not be replicated in subsequent confirmatory trials. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the trial design or sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials or add new requirements, such as the completion of additional studies, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data or may fail to approve the processes used to manufacture a product candidate, may find the cGMP compliance status of a facility that manufactures a product candidate unsatisfactory, may fail to approve or delay approval of our product candidates, dosing or delivery methods, companion devices or may otherwise grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated, including indications covering narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring or educational requirements or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any such events may delay our clinical development and regulatory efforts, delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and new indications for existing products, and result in significant additional costs and expenses, require additional time and have an adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations, or cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. Moreover, after taking such events into account, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline.\nWe may conduct clinical development in the US, Canada, the EU, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions and sell our products in the US and potentially in other major markets. To accomplish this objective, we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction. To avoid the significant expense and lengthy time required to complete multiple regional clinical development programs, we expect to meet with relevant regulatory authorities. While we would prefer to design a single, global clinical development program that would satisfy the regulators in all of our target markets, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we are unable to reach agreement with the various regulatory authorities, we may not be able to pursue regulatory approval of our products in all of our selected markets.\nEven if favorable data are generated from nonclinical and clinical studies, the FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, which may include:\n\u2022\na regulatory body may disagree with the design or implementation of one or more clinical trials;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or may deem a product candidate\u2019s safety or other perceived risks to outweigh its clinical or other benefits;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body for approval;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials performed by us or third parties;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may not deem the data collected from clinical trials to be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may identify deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling or specifications of our current or future product candidates;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials;\n\u2022\na regulatory body also may approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\na regulatory body may not approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with which we contract; or\n\u2022\na regulatory body may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing. We may obtain marketing approval in the US based on our product dossier, but not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the US on a timely basis, if at all, which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets. Even if we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate, a regulator may require us to demonstrate superiority over comparative products before agreeing to grant marketing approval. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, some countries, particularly those outside the US, regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In these countries, pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or analysis that compares the cost-effectiveness of their product candidate to other available therapies. Such trials or other evidence gathering may be time-consuming and expensive and may not show an advantage in health economics for our products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in either the US or the EU, we could be adversely affected. Moreover, failure to secure marketing authorization for any product candidate, including istaroxime and rostafuroxin, in accordance with our development plans, may result in an impairment of any related intangible asset and goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of our phase 3 ADS to perform as intended for our AEROSURF phase 3 development activities and, if approved, initial commercial activities, would have a material adverse effect on our efforts to develop AEROSURF as well as our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products, and our business strategy.\nOur development activities are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe phase 3 ADS that is intended for use in our remaining AEROSURF development activities, may not achieve acceptable levels of efficiency, consistent performance, reliability and cost appropriate for commercial activities;\n\u2022\nwe will require access to sophisticated engineering capabilities. We have our own medical device engineering staff and we have been working with Battelle on certain development initiatives. We currently are working with Mack Molding Company (Mack) to complete a technology transfer of our device manufacturing process and expect to manufacture with Mack a sufficient number of ADS to support our remaining development activities. If we are unable to identify design engineers and medical device experts to support our continued development efforts in the future, including, potentially, for commercial use and later versions of the phase 3 ADS, it would have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products; if we are unable to secure the necessary medical device development expertise to support our development program, this could impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products;\n\u2022\nthe ADS may perform to specifications in the bench setting and internal tests, however, at clinical sites with multiple operators of the device, we may experience an unanticipated issue with performance that could have a negative effect on trial outcomes.\nThe realization of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our AEROSURF development program and our business.\nEven though some of our product candidates have Fast Track designation, the FDA may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not have Fast Track designation.\nThe FDA has notified us that three indications of our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) technology pipeline, treatment of RDS, BPD in premature infants and ARDS in adults, have been granted designation as Fast Track products. Fast Track designation does not accelerate clinical trials, nor does it mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent. Instead, Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. We believe that other potential products in our KL4 surfactant technology pipeline may also qualify for Fast Track or other designations, including potentially breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval and priority review. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. Our product candidates may cease to qualify for Fast Track designation and our other product candidates may fail to qualify for any such designation or program.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which affects a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a drug that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years, which generally prevents the FDA from approving an NDA to market a drug containing the same active moiety for the same indication for that period, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior to the approved drug. A drug is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. However, we may lose Orphan Drug exclusivity if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nRisks related to Manufacturing Development and Manufacturing\nWe currently do not have back-up facilities for our CMOs, our suppliers of APIs or excipients, our third-party analytical testing and other materials. If the parties we depend on for supplying our APIs, materials and excipients as well as analytical testing and manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these products and services, it may delay or impair our ability to execute our development plans for our current and potential pipeline products. Such delays could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn most cases, we are dependent upon a single supplier to provide all of our requirements for our APIs, materials and excipients or one or more of our drug product device subcomponents, components and subassemblies, analytical testing and manufacturing-related services. We rely on single CMOs to manufacture drug product that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards for use in preclinical programs and clinical trials. Our ability to manufacture depends upon receiving adequate supplies and related services, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure. Supply chain or manufacturing interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of supply shortages, poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors, which could involve a lengthy process, and result in increased expenses. If we do not maintain these manufacturing and service relationships that are important to us and are not able to identify replacement suppliers, vendors and laboratories, or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products could be impaired or delayed and our costs could substantially increase. Even if we are able to find replacement manufacturers, suppliers, vendors and service providers when needed, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us or there could be a substantial delay before such manufacturer, vendor or supplier, or a related new facility is properly qualified and registered with the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. The process of changing a supplier could have an adverse impact on our current clinical development programs if supplies of drug substances, materials or excipients on hand are insufficient to satisfy demand. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business.\nWe plan to rely on third parties to manufacture our drug products and manufacture and assemble our medical devices, which exposes us to risks that may affect our ability to maintain supplies of our clinical materials and could potentially delay our research and development activities, as well as eventual regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug product candidates.\nOur manufacturing strategy includes manufacturing our drug products and our ADS using third-party CMOs. Technology transfers of our manufacturing process and our planned future reliance on CMOs exposes us, among other things, to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify manufacturers with whom we might establish appropriate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, because the number of potential CMOs is limited and, after a product candidate is approved, the FDA must approve any transfer to a different CMO. This approval could require one or more pre-approval inspections as well as a potentially lengthy qualification process. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our approved products after receipt of FDA approval. To qualify and receive regulatory approval for a new manufacturer could take as long as 2 years;\n\u2022\nwe may implement a plan to execute a technology transfer of our manufacturing process to a CMO and, after investing significant time and resources, learn that the CMO we chose is unable to successfully complete the technology transfer and thereafter manufacture our products in accordance with our plan;\n\u2022\nCMOs might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and to our specifications to meet our clinical and commercial needs, or we may have difficulty scheduling the production of drug product and devices in a timely manner to meet our timing requirements;\n\u2022\nCMOs may not perform as agreed, or may not remain in the CMO business for a lengthy time, or may refuse to renew an expiring agreement as expected, or may fail timely to produce a sufficient supply to meet our commercial and/or clinical needs;\n\u2022\nCMOs are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, international health authorities, registered Notified Body(ies), the Drug Enforcement Administration, and/or corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and/or QSR and other government regulations and corresponding international standards. Although we do not have control over the day-to-day operations of any CMO we may use, we are responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations and standards, and the failure of a CMO to have a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities would delay approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nif we desire to make our drug products and/or devices available outside the US for clinical or commercial purposes, our CMOs would become subject to, and may not be able to comply with, corresponding manufacturing and quality system regulations or standards of the various foreign regulators having jurisdiction over our activities abroad. Such failures (such as in-country quality testing) could result in not only a loss of approved supply to that country, but a total loss of a lot (or lots) of materials globally and could restrict our ability to execute our business strategies;\n\u2022\nif any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not have rights to, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any such innovation. Such an event could limit our ability to conduct technology transfers to alternate and successor manufacturers. We may be required to pay fees or other costs for access to such improvements; and\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty implementing changes or modifications to our manufacturing processes that may be required by the FDA or foreign regulator, if, for example, such changes would burden our CMO or otherwise disrupt operations, or our CMO could impose significant financial terms to implement any such change that could adversely affect our business. Failure to achieve such required changes or modifications could delay or prevent our gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or prevent us from continuing to market our approved products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nEach of the foregoing risks and others could delay our development programs and, if approved, commercial manufacturing plans, limit our ability to maintain continuity of supply for our approved products, delay or impair the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nManufacturing problems potentially could cause us to experience shortages of APIs, drug products, medical devices, and materials, or delay our preclinical or clinical development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical and medical device products requires significant expertise and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We, our CMOs or our materials and drug substances suppliers may experience manufacturing or quality control and assurance problems that could result in a failure to maintain compliance with cGMP and QSR requirements, or those of foreign regulators or notified bodies, which is necessary to continue manufacturing of our drug products, materials, drug substances, or medical devices. Any such failure could result in product production and shipment delays or an inability to obtain materials or drug substance supplies.\nIn connection with our drug product manufacturing activities, we own certain specialized manufacturing equipment installed at our CMO. However, we do not have fully-redundant systems and equipment to respond promptly in the event of a significant loss at a CMO's manufacturing operations. Under certain conditions, we may be unable to produce our drug product and medical devices at the required volumes or to appropriate standards, if at all. If we are unable to successfully maintain our manufacturing capabilities and at all times comply with cGMP and QSRs, it will adversely affect our development activities and clinical development programs.\nFor the development and, if approved, commercialization of our drug product candidates, we will depend upon third parties to manufacture our drug products and to manufacture and assemble our ADS for AEROSURF. If we are unable to identify and subsequently retain qualified manufacturers and assemblers, our ability to implement our plans for the further development of our product candidates and, if approved, commercialization of our therapies, will be adversely affected and could be severely impacted.\nWe plan to rely on CMOs to manufacture and assemble the ADS and all subcomponents to support any preclinical experiments, our ongoing and planned clinical trials and, if approved, commercial activities. We are working with Mack to produce our phase 3 ADS to support the remainder of our AEROSURF development activities and, if approved, early commercial supply. Although we expect that we will be able to produce and assemble the ADS for our future development activities with Mack as our CMO, there is a risk that our CMO will be unable to consistently manufacture and assemble the subcomponents of our ADS to our specified standards. In addition, the CMO may not be able to timely comply with regulatory manufacturing requirements. If we do not successfully identify and enter into agreements with manufacturers and assemblers that have the required expertise to produce our phase 3 ADS for use in our Phase 3 program, it will adversely affect our timeline for the development and, if approved, commercialization of AEROSURF.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nWe are continually evaluating our business strategy and may modify this strategy in light of developments in our business and other factors.\nWe continually evaluate our business strategy and plan to modify our strategy as necessary to achieve our objectives. The execution of a clinical development program is complex and involves the cooperation of many individuals and entities, including third parties that we may not be able to control, and requires the coordination of a number of elements, any one of which could involve delays or unforeseen events or circumstances that require adjustment or the development of alternative strategies. If we encounter such events or circumstances, we will change our strategy and plans if we believe that such a change will be in our best interest. There can be no assurance even if we alter our strategy or plans, that we will be successful, or that we will secure regulatory approval for our products and execute any product launches effectively and on time, if at all, in all markets that we may identify. To respond to changing circumstances, we may also expand or alter our research and development activities from time to time and allocate resources to work on development of different products or may pace, delay or halt the development of potential product programs. As a result of changes in our strategy, we may also change or refocus our existing drug development and manufacturing activities or our plans for commercialization of our products, if approved. These decisions could require changes in our facilities and personnel and restructuring various financial arrangements. There can be no assurances that any product development or other changes that we implement will be successful or that, after implementation of any such changes, that we will not refocus our efforts on new or different objectives.\nWe have limited resources, which could impair our ability to manage our diverse activities and accomplish our business objectives.\nThe demands on our management team have grown over time. Our capital resource and budget constraints have put our management under pressure to execute our business strategy with limited resources. Furthermore, as a result of our limited capital resources, our management team has had to dedicate an increasing amount of time towards raising capital, which diverts their attention away from our development programs.\nIn particular, our planned clinical trials and search for potential strategic partnerships, collaboration arrangements and similar transactions have placed and will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our financial and operational resources and will require that we continue to develop and improve our financial, operational and other internal controls. From time to time, we will be required to make difficult decisions on how to best allocate our resources.\nIf we are successful in identifying potential strategic or collaboration partners, we will be required to dedicate management resources and implement controls to establish alliance structures, and potentially add a layer of complexity to our operations. We plan to identify potential strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements that would have the resources and capabilities to not only help develop our products but would also distribute our products either globally or in specific regions or countries. This expansion could further increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems, expanding manufacturing and production capacity, expanding infrastructure and capabilities, and providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards. Our inability to grow our business effectively and appropriately or otherwise adapt to these challenges would cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nRisks Related to Strategic and Other Transactions\nFailure to successfully combine the business of CVie with ours in the expected time frame or realize the expected benefits of such combination may adversely affect our future results.\nThe success of our acquisition of CVie Therapeutics will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine its business with ours. Our management may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CVie Therapeutics development programs with ours; integrating the technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations; and prioritizing the scientific and clinical programs and retaining key personnel. If we are unable to successfully integrate CVie Therapeutics\u2019 operations, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may require significant investment to achieve the benefits or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the acquisition may also disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing businesses and/or adversely affect our relationships with employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings.\nThe integration of our business with that of CVie Therapeutics may divert our internal resources and management\u2019s attention away from our operations.\nSuccessful integration of CVie Therapeutics\u2019 operations, products and personnel may be complex, time consuming and place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and ability to evaluate strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements.\nOur plan to use strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements to leverage partner capabilities may not be successful if we are unable to integrate their capabilities with our own or if our partners' capabilities do not meet our expectations. Moreover, if our strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements should require greater focus and attention on our part than we expect, we may be forced to divert our limited resources away from our own development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and plans.\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to consummate any strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements. For these efforts to be successful, we must first identify partners whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours. Among other things, technologies or know how to which we gain access may prove ineffective or unsafe. Ownership of these technologies or know-how may be disputed. The agreements that grant us access to such technologies may expire and may not be renewable or could be terminated if our partners or we do not meet our respective obligations. In addition, our partners may provide certain services for us, such as product development support or distribution or commercialization services. These agreements may be subject to differing interpretations and we and our partners may not agree on the appropriate interpretation or specific requirements. Among other things, our partners may prove difficult to work with, less effective than we originally expected or unable to satisfy their financial and other commitments to us. Failure of our partners to perform as needed could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, if we are forced to allocate unplanned resources to bolster our strategic alliances or collaboration arrangement, our limited resources may be diverted from our core activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and plans.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements, which could expose us to risks associated with the transfer of control to third parties and may require that we transfer rights to our products to our partners and collaborators. In addition, if such arrangements potentially provide for the marketing and sale of our products, if approved, we will be exposed to additional risks.\nTo support our development programs and potentially the commercial introduction of our product candidates, we seek to identify potential strategic partners who could provide local development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources (potentially in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses), although there can be no assurance that we will ultimately secure such an alliance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we succeed in entering into one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements, our ability to execute our operating plan will depend upon numerous factors, including the performance of the strategic partners and collaborators with whom we may engage. Under these arrangements, our partners may control key decisions relating to the development and, if approved, commercialization of our products and may require that we transfer to them important rights to our products and/or product candidates. We may not be able to control the timing or resources that our partners devote to our arrangement. In addition, if we or our strategic alliance partners, distributors or collaborators breach or terminate our agreements or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our distribution or commercialization arrangements to our satisfaction, we may not achieve our goals within the desired time, if at all, and projected sales and our revenues would suffer.\nIf a strategic partner, distributor or collaborator were to enter into a business combination or other significant transaction, such transaction may adversely affect a partner or collaborator's willingness or ability to perform its obligations, which would adversely affect our business. We also may incur additional expense to terminate such arrangements and to identify and enter into arrangements with replacement partners or collaborators. Moreover, we may have difficulty enforcing our rights in a foreign jurisdiction. Upon termination of any such agreements, we would need to identify other partners or collaborators or develop our own internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our products, which could involve a significant investment and a potentially unacceptable delay. If we, our partners or our collaborators fail to conduct our respective activities in a timely manner, or otherwise breach or terminate the agreements that make up our arrangements, or if a dispute should arise under our agreements or collaboration arrangements, such events could impair our ability to commercialize or develop our products in a competitive and timely manner and would have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of our products.\nIn entering into any collaboration arrangement, including for AEROSURF, our lyophilized KL4 surfactant technology and rostafuroxin, we also will need to consider whether such collaboration could impair our ability to enter into other strategic transactions, including a potential merger or acquisition. We may find it difficult, for example, to identify and enter into commercialization agreements acceptable terms, if at all, in limited territories in the EU, where we have a collaboration with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. (Esteve) in a territory consisting of Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain (the Esteve Territory). If we identify potential collaborators for all or parts of the remainder of the EU, strategic differences could arise, which could result in disputes or otherwise impede the progress of our collaborations. Moreover, if a collaborator or its sublicensees does not meet their obligations, our arrangements may not be successful, and, as a result, we may not receive any revenues.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation, Quality and Safety\nIssues with product quality could have an adverse effect on our business, subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of confidence in our products or us.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop quality products. Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to develop, maintain, and continuously improve our quality management system, including an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key process indicators. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. We are dependent upon third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to support our development and commercialization activities. Third-party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays or other quality-related issues. A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on patients receiving our drug products and on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in our current or future products or us, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in commercializing our products.\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, potential future product sales and stock price.\nAdverse safety events involving our products under development and our marketed products may have a negative impact on our business. Safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nOur activities are subject to various and complex laws and regulations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment. Any failure to comply could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and our operations are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the US. Our drug product candidates and medical devices must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Our facilities and those of our third-party providers must pass inspection and/or be approved or licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection at any time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our post-marketing reporting, could result in warning or untitled letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of our products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our sales. In addition, requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change and implementing any additional compliance requirements may increase our costs, or force us or our third-party providers to suspend production, which could result in a shortage of our approved product or delays in the commercial introduction of our new product candidates, if approved.\nThe Health Care Reform Law includes provisions, referred to as the federal Open Payments law (previously referred to as the Sunshine Law), that establish new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Under the law, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are required to annually report various types of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are to report data to the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on an annual basis, and the data are made publicly available via a CMS website. Inaccurate or incomplete reports may be subject to enforcement, and it is expected that data will be subject to significant public scrutiny. Like the federal Open Payments law, several states have existing laws that require manufacturers to report transfers of value to select healthcare providers licensed within the state, or even go so far as to prohibit certain marketing related activities. Other states, such as California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Connecticut, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. In others, it is possible that we will be subject to the state's reporting requirements and prohibitions. Compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations.\nIf our products are approved for commercial sale, we will be required to comply with not only the requirements of the FDA and potentially international regulators, but will also become subject to various federal, state and international laws regulating the sales, marketing, and distribution of healthcare-related products. These laws govern such activities as our relationships with healthcare providers, the promotion of our products, and pricing of prescription drug products and medical devices. The sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA and other federal regulators have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products, and other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies' sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers.\nOf particular importance, federal and state anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. These laws can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. In addition, the absence of guidance for some of these laws and the very few court decisions addressing industry practices increase the likelihood that our practices could be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the government (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, a number of states require that companies implement compliance programs or comply with industry ethics codes, adopt spending limits, and report to state governments any gifts, compensation, and other remuneration provided to physicians. Many pharmaceutical, device, and other health care companies have been investigated and prosecuted for alleged violations of these laws. Sanctions under these laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), criminal fines, and imprisonment. Companies that have chosen to settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi-million-dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements, which often include significant and costly burdens. Under the federal False Claims Act and related state laws, private individuals may bring similar actions. In addition, an increasing number of state laws require manufacturers to report to the state certain pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the state authorities.\nIn addition, failure to comply with domestic and international privacy and security laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with these laws, including protecting electronically stored information from cyber-attacks, and potential liability associated with failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or collectively, HIPAA. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.\nWe are continually evaluating our compliance programs, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the outlined above. However, no compliance program can mitigate risk in its entirety. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe political and healthcare policy environment is becoming more challenging for pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers and may adversely affect our business.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences globally are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental challenges that could substantially affect our business and results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing to arise in many countries where we potentially may seek to do business, including the US. There is increasing pressure on pricing, reimbursement and demands for value-based data to gain access to patients and healthcare funds globally. This may increase the costs of development, risks of commercialization and overall value of the opportunity.\nGiven the increasing uncertainty in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, capital investment in our industry and our ability to attract capital investment is becoming more challenging. This trend, if continued, may restrict or impair our ability to gain necessary funding for continued development and, if approved, commercialization of our products.\nOur international operations subject us to additional regulatory oversight in foreign jurisdictions., as well as economic, social, and political uncertainties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with having assets and operations located in foreign jurisdictions, including our operations in Italy and Taiwan. Our operations in Italy and Taiwan are subject to regulatory agencies, such as the Italian Ministry of Health and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, and increased government regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nOther Risks Affecting our Business\nHealthcare reform measures in the US as well as the general tightening of drug reimbursement pathways and levels of reimbursement globally are expected to add additional pressure to achieve financial expectations for approved products.\nIf approved, our products are expected to face increasing pricing and reimbursement pressures from payors globally. Such pressures can impair our ability to access patients in geographies or access certain types of patient - regardless of the breadth of our data or approved indications. Pressure from payors, particularly single source government payors and global price referencing, can result in companies being forced to give greater discounts and/or lower pricing than planned resulting in barriers to achieving financial forecasts or even justifying ongoing or additional investment in clinical development programs.\nA small group of investors, including Lee\u2019s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, may be able to exercise significant influence over our business strategy and operations.\nAs of April 5, 2019, Lee's beneficially owns through its affiliates, approximately 40% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and fund affiliates of our Chairman, James Huang, own approximately 28% of our issued and outstanding common stock. These investors could exercise their voting power in a coordinated fashion to approve any matter requiring shareholder approval by written consent without a stockholder meeting. As a result, there is a risk that these investors could cause corporate actions to be approved even if their interests conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing institutional investors interested in us or a change in control that might be beneficial to our other shareholders.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we engage in business development activities intended to identify strategic opportunities, including potential strategic alliances, joint development opportunities, acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements and other similar opportunities. Such opportunities may result in substantial investments in our business. Our success in developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for investment, alliance or acquisition; whether we are able to complete an investment, alliance or acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of our underlying technology, products and our ability to execute our business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully execute the investment, alliance or acquisition into our existing operations, including to fund our share of any in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to secure needed capital and expertise to support our development programs and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to the cost or timing of clinical development programs, product approval, production and supply dates, commercial launch dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions developed by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections and management\u2019s expectations in (or incorporated by reference in) this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline.\nAny failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. If we do not file our financial statements on a timely basis as required by the SEC, we could face severe consequences. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Responding to inquiries from the SEC, regardless of the outcome, are likely to consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense. Further, many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities, including in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products, if approved, and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business.\nMany of our activities, including the research, development, manufacture, sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive laws and regulation, including without limitation, health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and other state and federal laws and regulations. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices, but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such investigations, actions or lawsuits are instituted against us, and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability, such investigations, actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nThere is uncertainty and risk of noncompliance regarding the use of social media platforms by the biopharmaceutical industry. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of political or market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nFailure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party contractors maintain sensitive data on our and their respective networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our clinical trial participants and business partners. The secure maintenance of this sensitive information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party contractors are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, human error, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. For information stored with our third-party contractors, we rely upon, and the integrity and confidentiality of such information is dependent upon, the risk mitigation efforts such third-party contractors have in place. Our and our third-party contractors\u2019 respective network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Such incidents could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information, cause interruptions in our operations, result in a material disruption of our operations, or require substantial expenditures of resources to remedy.\nA catastrophic event at our Warrington, Pennsylvania facility or any of the facilities used by our third-party-manufacturers would prevent us from producing our drug product candidates and/or medical devices.\nOur headquarters facilities are located in Warrington, Pennsylvania. We also have a research laboratory in Milan, Italy (Bicocca) and preclinical activities in Taipei, Taiwan. We depend upon third-party manufacturers and laboratories, to manufacture our drug products, our AFECTAIR device and our ADS and perform important API and drug product release testing and stability work. If a catastrophic event occurred at our headquarters facility or our other facilities or the facilities of any of our third-party manufacturers and laboratories, the manufacture of those products would be delayed. With respect to the analytical laboratory at our headquarters facility, any interruption in release and ongoing stability testing could have an adverse impact on our inventories needed to support our ongoing clinical activities and, if approved, commercial activities. We have obtained insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses. However, there can be no assurance that any such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, other companies could use our technology in competitive products. Even if we obtain patents to protect our products, those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us.\nThe patent position of biotechnology companies is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. To date, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that is accorded in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford. As a result, there are risks that we may not secure proprietary rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable.\nThe parties who licensed technologies to us and we have filed various US and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development, and the USPTO and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies. These patent applications include international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Our pending patent applications, as well as those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the USPTO or foreign patent office issuing patents. In addition, if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad, they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies. Furthermore, even if the USPTO or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors, others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents, or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents. Thus, any patents we own or license from third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors.\nThe patents that we hold have a limited life. Certain of such patents related to lyophilized KL4 surfactant have issued in the US, Europe and elsewhere and will expire in March 2033. For our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, we hold worldwide exclusive licenses to our proprietary aerosol delivery systems (ADS) technology for use with pulmonary surfactants alone or in combination with other products for all respiratory diseases and in the US to other (non-surfactant) drugs to treat certain pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. The ADS patents have expired or will expire on various dates beginning in May 2016 and ending as late as 2037. For patents related to our cardiovascular drug products owned by CVie Therapeutics are issued in the US, Europe and elsewhere have expired or will expire on various dates between 2026 and 2030.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others. Patent applications in most jurisdictions are not published until 18 months after filing. In certain cases, the USPTO keeps US patent applications confidential for the entire time the applications are pending. As a result, we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications. We may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings, which would be costly, unpredictable and time consuming. Even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us, they would likely divert substantial resources, including management time, from our other activities. Moreover, any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products. An adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities.\nIf we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements, we could lose the rights to our products.\nWe depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development. These agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights. By their terms, all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the related patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product. In addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology. Finally, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies. Licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe rely on agreements containing obligations regarding intellectual property, confidentiality and noncompetition provisions that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce.\nAlthough we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets to third parties, as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas, developments, improvements, discoveries and inventions of our employees, consultants, advisors and research collaborators while we employ them, such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. We generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants, advisors and research collaborators; however, to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights. Such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results.\nMoreover, although all employees enter into agreements with us that include non-compete covenants, and our five senior executive officers have agreements that include broader non-competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee\u2019s refraining from competition with us, such non-compete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce, such that, if any should resign, we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them.\nDespite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u2022\nagreements may be breached;\n\u2022\nagreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach;\n\u2022\nour trade secrets or proprietary know-how may otherwise become known;\n\u2022\nour competitors may independently develop similar technology; or\n\u2022\nour competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets.\nWe depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we or our strategic partners or collaborators are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe have assembled a team of qualified personnel to advance the development programs for our product candidates. We have competed and will continue to compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is significant and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors, as well as our consultants and collaborating scientists. Many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years, have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us. A loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs. The loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Further, we do not maintain key man life insurance.\nOur future success also will depend on the continued service of our key professional, scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit and retain additional personnel. While we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization, many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. We may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non-competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards. We compete with numerous existing companies in many ways. We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. If we cannot successfully introduce new products, adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers\u2019 requirements, our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer.\nMany of our competitors companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technology personnel and managerial resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, preclinical testing and human clinical trials management, obtaining FDA approval and other regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in receiving FDA or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products and obtaining patent protection before us. Our competitors may successfully secure regulatory exclusivities in various markets, which could have the effect of barring us or limiting our ability to market our products in such markets. In addition, developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe also face, and will continue to face, competition from colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations. These competitive forces frequently and aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for technologies that they develop. Some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing. These institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel.\nThe failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation, including securities class actions, product liability claims and patent infringement claims, could harm our financial performance and business operations.\nOur business activities, including development, manufacture and, if our products are approved, marketing of our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks. Using our drug product candidates or medical devices, including in clinical trials, may expose us to product liability claims. Even if approved, our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death. Product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise.\nThere can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nWe may be required to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage. However, such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it. In the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance, with acceptable limits and retentions, at an acceptable cost. Any product, general liability or product liability claim, even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development. In addition, such claims could result in:\n\u2022\nuninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants;\n\u2022\na decrease in demand for our drug product candidates;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation; and\n\u2022\nan inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates, if approved.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation), our Amended and Restated By-Laws (By-Laws) and Delaware law could deter a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management and might discourage a third-party from offering to acquire us, even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions may make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Moreover, our obligations to the holders of preferred stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of preferred stock and holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 82156, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "WINT"}
