RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nOur future operating results may be impacted by changes in global economic and political conditions.\nOur future operating results and liquidity may be impacted by changes in general economic and political conditions which may affect, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nThe availability of credit and our ability to obtain additional or renewed bank financing, the lack of which may limit our ability to invest in capital projects and planned expansions or to fully execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nMarket rates of interest, any increase in which would increase the interest payable on some of our borrowings and adversely impact our cash flow;\n\u2022\nThe investment performance of our pension plan, as well as the associated discount rate, any adverse changes in which may result in a deterioration in the funded status of the plan and an increase in required contributions and plan expense;\n\u2022\nThe relationship between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, any adverse changes in which could negatively impact our financial results;\n\u2022\nThe ability of our customers to pay for products and services on a timely basis, any adverse change in which could negatively impact sales and cash flows and require us to increase our bad debt reserves;\n\u2022\nThe volume of orders we receive from our customers, any adverse change in which could result in lower operating profits as well as less absorption of fixed costs due to a decreased business base;\n\u2022\nThe ability of our suppliers to meet our demand requirements, maintain the pricing of their products or continue operations, any of which may require us to find and qualify new suppliers; and\n\u2022\nThe issuance and timely receipt of necessary export approvals, licenses and authorizations from the U.S. Government.\nWhile general economic and political conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or our ability to access capital.\nOur financial performance is significantly influenced by customer demand for the products we distribute.\nThe financial performance of our Distribution segment, which generated approximately 60.8% of our 2018 consolidated net sales and approximately 35.3% of our 2018 operating income before corporate expenses, loss on sale of business and net gain (loss) on sale of assets, is significantly influenced by customer demand for the products we distribute and the services we provide. Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be significantly influenced by the same factors that affect demand for and production of our customers' goods and services, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nthe economic health of the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy, as reflected by the Purchasing Managers Index\u00ae reported by the Institute for Supply Management, as an index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy;\n\u2022\nthe consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas, which subsequently reduces demand for the products we distribute and the services we provide; and\n\u2022\nthe general industrial economy, which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output.\nAny adverse changes in these and other factors affecting the demand for and production of our customers' goods and materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial performance is also significantly influenced by conditions within the aerospace and defense industries.\nThe financial performance of our Aerospace segment, which generated approximately 39.2% of our 2018 consolidated net sales and approximately 64.7% of our 2018 operating income before corporate expenses, loss on sale of business and net gain (loss) on sale of assets, is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries.\nThe commercial aviation industry tends to be cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a variety of global factors including current and future traffic levels, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels.\nThe defense industry may be influenced by a changing global political environment, changes in U.S. and global defense spending, U.S. foreign policy and the activity level of military flight operations.\nChanges to the aerospace and defense industries and any reductions in U.S. defense spending could have a material impact on our current and proposed aerospace programs, which could adversely affect our operating results and future prospects. In addition, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled, which could put a portion of our backlog at risk.\nFurthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing new products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when a new product is introduced. A reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations.\nOur USG programs are subject to unique risks.\nWe have several significant long-term contracts either directly with the USG or where the USG is the ultimate customer, including the Sikorsky BLACK HAWK cockpit and Combat Rescue Helicopter programs, the Joint Programmable Fuze (\u201cJPF\u201d) program and the AH-1Z program. These contracts are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Examples of such risks include:\n\u2022\nThe USG may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts at its convenience without prior notice, upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nOur USG business is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in USG contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. Although we have procedures designed to assure compliance with these regulations and requirements, failure to do so under certain circumstances could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from USG contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could adversely impact our reputation and our ability to receive other USG contract awards in the future.\n\u2022\nThe costs we incur on our USG contracts, including allocated indirect costs, may be audited by USG representatives. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract would not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would have to be refunded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, if any audit were to reveal the existence of improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the USG.\n\u2022\nWe are from time to time subject to governmental inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in domestic and foreign government contracts and programs and our transaction of business domestically and internationally. Adverse findings associated with any such inquiry or investigation could also result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with domestic and foreign governments.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the USG.\nBecause a significant percentage of our revenue is derived either directly or indirectly from contracts with the USG, changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and authorizations, and we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary U.S. Government approvals and resultant export licenses for proposed sales to certain foreign customers.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and technologies, including, among others, the FMU-152A/B JPF, before we are permitted to sell those products and technologies outside of the United States. Compliance often entails the submission and timely receipt of necessary export approvals, licenses or authorizations from the U.S. Government and, depending on the size and nature of the proposed transaction, may even require the submission of formal notification to the United States Congress, which then has the ability to pass a joint resolution of disapproval blocking or amending the sale. In recent months, the U.S. export licensing environment for munitions, such as the JPF, has been adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the changing geopolitical environment and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time). Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, in a timely manner or at all, the approvals, licenses or authorizations we need to sell our products and technologies outside the United States, which may result in the cancellation of orders, the incurrence of significant penalties payable by the Company and the return of advance payments to our customers if we do not make deliveries and fulfill our contractual commitments. Any significant delay in, or impairment of, our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability to obtain and retain product approvals issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") and any intellectual property claims could adversely affect our Aerospace segment\u2019s operating results and profits.\nOur Aerospace segment may be impacted by regulations set forth by the FAA to obtain Parts Manufacturer Approvals (\"PMAs\") to design or produce a modification or replacement aircraft part. The loss or suspension of the Company's product and design approvals could negatively impact our operating results and profits. We believe our current design and production processes that are subject to such regulations by the FAA are in compliance; however, there can be no assurance that we will not lose approvals for our products in the future. Additionally, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, including in connection with our PMA business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost and effort to start up new aerospace programs could negatively impact our operating results and profits.\nThe time required and costs incurred to ramp up a new program can be significant and include nonrecurring costs for tooling, first article testing, finalizing drawings and engineering specifications and hiring new employees able to perform the technical work required. New programs can typically involve a greater volume of scrap, higher costs due to inefficiencies, delays in production and learning curves that are often more extended than anticipated, all of which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition from domestic and foreign manufacturers may result in the loss of potential contracts and opportunities.\nThe aerospace markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we often compete for work not only with large OEMs but also sometimes with our own customers and suppliers. Many of our large customers may choose not to outsource production due to, among other things, their own direct labor and overhead considerations and capacity utilization objectives. This could result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not have the technology, cost structure, or available resources to effectively compete with them. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage requires continued investment in product development; engineering; supply chain management; production capabilities, including technology, equipment and facilities; and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make the necessary investments to do so. Further, our significant customers may attempt to use their position to negotiate price or other concessions for a particular product or service without regard to the terms of an existing contract or the underlying cost of production.\nWe believe our strategies for our Aerospace segment will allow us to continue to effectively compete for key contracts and customers, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this market or against such competitors.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the loss of key suppliers, the consolidation of suppliers, the lack of product availability or changes in supplier programs.\nOur business depends on maintaining a sufficient supply of various products to meet our customers' demands. We have long-standing relationships with key suppliers but these relationships generally are non-exclusive and could be terminated by either party. If we were to lose a key supplier, or were unable to obtain the same levels of deliveries from these suppliers and were unable to supplement those purchases with products obtained from other suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on foreign and domestic suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in many of the products we manufacture within our Aerospace segment or sell within our Distribution segment. Suppliers have consolidated and formed alliances to broaden their product and integrated system offerings, and achieve critical mass. Supplier consolidation could cause us to compete against certain competitors with greater financial resources, market penetration and purchasing power. This exposes us to volatility in the price and availability of raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions or other reasons beyond our control. Even if we continue with our current supplier relationships, high demand for certain products may result in us being unable to meet our customers' demands, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, our key suppliers could also increase the pricing of their products, which would negatively affect our operating results if we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers. We base our supply management process on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. To protect ourselves against such risks, we engage in strategic inventory purchases during the year, negotiate long-term vendor supply agreements, monitor our inventory levels and obtain second sources when applicable to ensure that we have the appropriate inventory on hand to meet our customers' requirements.\nThe adoption of new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance could affect our financial results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes nearly all existing generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") lease guidance. The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 and we have elected the transition method allowing entities to apply the new standard at the adoption date recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption. We have completed our preliminary evaluation of the likely impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. For additional information about these matters, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Standards in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2018, we implemented ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded nearly all GAAP revenue recognition guidance. For additional information on the impact of this standard, please refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior credit facility could trigger an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with various operational and other covenants. If we were unable to maintain these ratios and comply with such covenants, we would need to seek relief from our lenders in order to avoid, cure or have waived an event of default under the facility. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, we may not be able to make further borrowings under the credit facility and our lenders could, among other things, cause all outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility to be due and payable immediately. There can be no assurance that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund outstanding commitments or meet other business requirements or to enable us to fully repay those amounts or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the indebtedness. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility, or amend the financial ratios and covenants contained therein, the lenders under our senior credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. This, in turn, could result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing agreements, including our convertible notes.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, certain of our customers require us to deliver standby letters of credit to guarantee our performance under our contractual obligations with them, which are currently issued by certain of our lenders pursuant to our senior credit facility. If we are unable to obtain letters of credit as needed to operate our business as a result of any of the circumstances described above or otherwise, our ability to enter into certain contracts may be adversely affected. Moreover, by their nature, standby letters of credit may be drawn upon by the beneficiaries thereof, which could affect our financial ratios and ability to make additional borrowings. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\nAdditional tax exposure and tax law changes could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and we are periodically under audit by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We are currently under audit by various states for the years 2013 through 2017. Although we do not believe that any material adjustments will result from these audits, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Any final assessment resulting from tax audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\") was signed into law. One of the major provisions in this legislation was a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. While this rate reduction was favorable to earnings in 2018, the rate change also required a revaluation of our existing net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. Other provisions of Tax Reform also impacted the Company, but given the rate reduction, the overall impact of the Tax Reform was beneficial to the Company in 2018. For additional information on Tax Reform, please refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecently enacted tariffs on certain imports to the United States and other potential changes to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\nIn 2018, new tariffs were implemented on imports of steel and aluminum into the United States. As the implementation of tariffs is ongoing, more tariffs may be added in the future. While any steel and aluminum we use in our products is produced primarily in North America, the new tariffs may provide domestic steel and aluminum producers the flexibility to increase their prices, at least to a level where their products would still be priced below foreign competitors once the tariffs are taken into account. These tariffs could have an adverse impact on our financial results, which include, but are not limited to, the following: products we sell include steel and aluminum and if we are unable to pass such price increases through to our customers, it would likely increase our cost of sales and, as a result, decrease our gross margins, operating income and net income. In addition, in response to the new tariffs, a number of other countries are threatening to impose tariffs on U.S. imports, which, if implemented, could increase the price of our products in these countries and may result in our customers looking to alternative sources for our products. This would result in decreased sales, which could have a negative impact on our net income and financial condition. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $17.4 million in net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance. These deferred tax assets can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. In the event that there is insufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in a material non-cash charge in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe freezing of our defined benefit pension plan could trigger a material curtailment adjustment in favor of the USG.\nOur defined benefit pension plan was frozen with respect to future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2015. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (\"CAS 413\") requires the Company to determine the USG\u2019s share of any resulting pension curtailment adjustment attributable to pension expense charged to Company contracts with the USG, which could result in an amount due to the USG if the plan is determined to be in a surplus position or an amount due to the Company if the plan is determined to be in a deficit position. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company accrued a $0.3 million liability representing our estimate of the amount due to the USG based on our pension curtailment adjustment calculation, which was submitted to the USG for review in December 2016. The Company has maintained its accrual at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2018. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEstimates of future costs for long-term contracts impact our current and future operating results and profits.\nWe generally recognize sales and gross margin on long-term contracts based on the over time method of accounting. This method allows for revenue recognition as our work progresses on a contract and requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract. Revenues are estimated based upon the negotiated contract price, with consideration being given to exercised contract options, change orders and, in some cases, projected customer requirements. Contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers, engineers and financial professionals.\nEstimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. The complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and the availability of materials and labor resources could affect our ability to accurately estimate future contract costs. Additional factors that could affect recognition of revenue and gross margin under this method include:\n\u2022\nAccounting for initial program costs;\n\u2022\nThe effect of nonrecurring work;\n\u2022\nDelayed contract start-up or changes to production schedules;\n\u2022\nTransition of work to or from the customer or other vendors;\n\u2022\nClaims or unapproved change orders;\n\u2022\nProduct warranty issues;\n\u2022\nDelayed completion of certain programs for which inventory has been built up;\n\u2022\nOur ability to estimate or control scrap level;\n\u2022\nAccrual of contract losses; and\n\u2022\nChanges in our overhead rates.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect current and future financial performance. While we perform quarterly reviews of our long-term contracts to address and lessen the effects of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not make material adjustments to underlying assumptions or estimates relating to one or more long-term contracts that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may lose money or generate lower than expected profits on our fixed-price contracts.\nOur customers set demanding specifications for product performance, reliability and cost. Most of our government contracts and subcontracts provide for a predetermined, fixed price for the products we make regardless of the costs we incur. Therefore, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of sales that we may achieve. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately, integrate technical processes effectively or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract may reduce the profitability of a fixed-price contract or cause a loss. While we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed-price contracts as required under GAAP, there can be no assurance that our contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses.\nThe U.S. Navy contract award for the FMU-139 D/B bomb fuze could jeopardize the continued viability and profitability of the Company's FMU-152 A/B bomb fuze program with the U.S. Air Force (\"USAF\").\nThe Company currently provides the FMU-152 A/B bomb fuze (also referred to as the JPF) to the USAF and thirty-six other nations, but the U.S. Navy currently utilizes a different fuze - the FMU-139. During 2015, the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (\u201cNAVAIR\u201d) solicited proposals for a firm-fixed price production contract to implement improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 (such improved fuze having been designated the FMU-139 D/B). The USAF has stated that, if and when a contract is awarded and production begins, the funds associated with the FMU-152 A/B will be redirected to the FMU-139 D/B. During the third quarter of 2015, the U.S. Navy awarded the FMU-139 D/B contract to a competitor. In the event that the FMU-139 D/B program proceeds as planned and the USAF redirects the funds associated with the FMU-152 A/B to the FMU-139 D/B, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely impacted. The timing of the impact on our financial statements is dependent on the ability of our competitor to complete the design and qualification phase of the program and other factors. Our competitor has publicly stated that this program will have a 32-month qualification phase, after which production will begin. Due to the complexity of this program, the uncertainty associated with the successful completion of each phase and the pending status of the USAF's final decision to redirect funds to the FMU-139 D/B, the timing and magnitude of the impact on the Company's financial statements is not certain.\nA failure to develop and retain corporate accounts at our Distribution segment could adversely impact our financial results.\nCompanies continue to consolidate their purchases of industrial products through a small number of major distributors or integrated suppliers, rather than a large number of vendors. Our Distribution segment has developed a strategy to compete effectively for corporate accounts, but we face intensifying competition from our competitors, several of which are larger and have a more extensive geographic footprint.\nIf we are not awarded additional national accounts in the future, or if existing corporate account agreements are not renewed, our sales volume could be negatively impacted, which may result in lower gross margins and weaker operating results. Additionally, national accounts may require an increased level of customer service, such as investments in the form of opening new branches to meet our customers' needs. The cost and time associated with these activities could be significant, and if the relationship is not maintained, we ultimately may not be able to generate a return on these investments.\nThe loss of the Distribution segment\u2019s key suppliers with whom we have national reseller agreements and/or national distributor agreements could adversely affect our operating results and profits.\nAn element of our Distribution segment\u2019s strategy is to establish alignment with a single vendor in certain portions of its business. As a result, we currently have distribution rights for certain product lines and depend on these distribution rights as a source of business. Many of these distribution rights are ours pursuant to contracts that are subject to cancellation upon little or no prior notice. Although we believe we could obtain alternate distribution rights in the event of such a cancellation, the termination or limitation by any key supplier of its relationship with the Company could result in a temporary disruption of our business and, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in sales at our Distribution segment could adversely impact the vendor incentives and rebates we earn from suppliers.\nSome of our suppliers offer vendor incentives and rebates that are tied to the amount of product that we purchase. These incentives and rebates can be market or customer-account specific, or relate to a specified program period. A decline in sales could adversely impact the vendor incentives and rebates we earn from suppliers.\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions or failures which may affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur information technology systems provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage our business. Our computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions.\nCyber-attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, manipulation of data, disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information, including trade secrets, and corruption of data, networks or systems. We provide products and services to customers who also face cyber threats. Our products and services may be subject to cyber threats and we may not be able to detect or deter such threats, which could result in losses that could adversely affect our customers and our company. Additionally, we could be impacted by cyber threats in products that we use in our partners' and customers' systems that are used in connection with our business. These events, if not prevented or mitigated, could damage our reputation, require remedial action and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, potential liability and other financial losses. To address the risks to our information technology systems and data, we manage an information security program, maintain strong incident report capabilities and perform daily off-site backups. Additionally, we have put in place business continuity plans and security precautions for our critical systems, including a back-up data center. Updates on cyber security are provided to the Board of Directors at least annually.\nIn the event our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches resulting in unauthorized access or cyber-attacks, and our information security program, incident report capabilities, business continuity plans and security precautions do not function effectively on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations or the misappropriation of proprietary information, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur implementation of enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe are currently implementing new ERP systems within our Aerospace and Distribution segments. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that take several years. If we do not effectively implement the ERP systems or if the systems do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur ability to provide assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud depends on effective internal control. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements; therefore, even effective controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If our internal controls were to be compromised, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Any material weakness could adversely impact investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial statements, affecting our ability to obtain additional financing. This would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market value of our stock. Additionally, we would be required to incur costs to make the necessary improvements to our internal control systems.\nAlthough management has assessed our internal control over financial reporting as effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations - Integrated Framework, we can give no assurance that material weaknesses will not occur in the future nor that existing controls will continue to be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure fair presentation of our financial statements in the future.\nWe may make acquisitions or investments in new businesses, products or technologies that involve additional risks, which could disrupt our business or harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made, and expect to continue to make, acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products, services and technologies. Such acquisitions or investments involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nAssimilating operations and products may be unexpectedly difficult;\n\u2022\nManagement's attention may be diverted from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nWe may enter markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u2022\nWe may lose key employees, customers or vendors of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to achieve the synergies or cost savings we anticipated;\n\u2022\nWe may not realize the assigned value of the acquired assets;\n\u2022\nWe may experience quality control failures or encounter other customer relationship issues; and\n\u2022\nWe may become subject to preexisting liabilities and obligations of the acquired businesses.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the consideration paid for any future acquisitions could include our stock or require that we incur additional debt and contingent liabilities. As a result, future acquisitions could cause dilution of existing equity interests and earnings per share.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which entail special risks.\nThe Company has a 49% equity interest in Kineco-Kaman Composites - India Private Limited, a composites manufacturing joint venture located in Goa, India. The Company relies significantly on the services and skills of its joint venture partner to manage and conduct the local business operations of the joint venture and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If our joint venture partner fails to perform these functions adequately, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, if our joint venture partner fails to honor its financial obligations to commit capital, equity or credit support to the joint venture as a result of financial or other difficulties or for any other reason, the joint venture may be unable to perform contracted services or deliver contracted products unless we provide the necessary capital, equity or credit support.\nWe may be unable to realize expected benefits from our sales initiatives and cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn both of our segments, we have a number of initiatives to grow sales and win new programs. Additionally, in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, from time to time, we announce restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions, as well as other savings. We may undertake further sales growth initiatives, workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of sales growth initiatives and cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current initiatives and restructuring activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these initiatives, actions and other workforce management issues include political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets, whether due to the loss of employees, work stoppages or otherwise, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated sales or cost reductions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial results of operations could be adversely affected by impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to the excess of the amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the business we acquire. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be evaluated at least annually for impairment. The specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized intangible assets for impairment requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Changes in our estimates and assumptions, including economic and market projections in our Distribution Segment and commercial and military program awards in our Aerospace Segment, could adversely impact projected cash flows and the fair value of reporting units. Fair value is generally determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we generally perform our evaluations annually in the fourth quarter, using available forecast information. If at any time we determine an impairment has occurred, we are required to reflect the reduction in value as an expense within operating income, resulting in a reduction of earnings and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value in the period such impairment is identified.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our skilled employees, and must continue to attract and retain qualified technical, marketing and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for such personnel in the aerospace and distribution industries. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably.\nWe are subject to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to contract-related claims, government contracts, product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, taxes, employment, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, competition laws, laws governing improper business practices and data privacy laws, including the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018. In the event that we or one of our business units engage in wrongdoing in connection with any of these kinds of matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. Moreover, our failure to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges.\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by the outcome of pending legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted. In accordance with GAAP, if a liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time, we make an estimate of material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment. The accrual of a loss contingency adversely affects our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized. This could also have an adverse impact on our cash flows in the period during which damages are paid.\nFor a discussion of these matters, please refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 11, Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur foreign operations require us to comply with a number of United States and international laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with a number of United States and international laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the \"Bribery Act\"), and other similar anticorruption laws and regulations. The FCPA generally prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Although we have internal controls, procedures and compliance programs to train our employees and agents with respect to compliance with the FCPA and other applicable international laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Allegations of violations of applicable international laws and regulations, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act, may result in internal, independent or government investigations. Violations of the FCPA and other international laws and regulations may lead to severe criminal or civil sanctions and could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom\u2019s (\"UK\") likely exit from the European Union (\"EU\") could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have business operations in both the UK and the broader EU. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the UK elected to withdraw from the EU in a national referendum, and the UK is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the EU, which is scheduled for March 29, 2019. In November 2018, the UK and the EU agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including commitments on citizen rights after its withdrawal, a financial settlement from the UK and a transition period from March 29, 2019 through December 31, 2020 to allow time for a future deal to be agreed upon. On January 15, 2019, the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the UK parliament, creating significant uncertainty regarding the terms and timing under which the UK will leave the EU. In addition, the UK referendum and withdrawal process have given rise to calls for the governments of other EU member states to consider withdrawal.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate in the course of its withdrawal, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. If the UK and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the UK and other EU member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Any of these factors could have a direct or indirect impact on our business in the UK and EU, our customers and suppliers in the UK and EU and our business outside the UK and EU. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur foreign operations present additional risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur foreign business operations create additional risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in accounts receivable collection, including complexities in documenting letters of credit;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nExport restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nSeasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world;\n\u2022\nPolitical or economic instability in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nCultural and legal differences impacting the conduct of business.\nIn addition, our contracts with foreign customers may include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks. These include, among others, industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset requirements, and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. Our foreign customers may also require us to enter in letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and/or other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations. All or any of these factors have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe are exposed to risks that are unique to the products and services we provide. While we believe that we maintain adequate insurance for certain risks, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is therefore possible that our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial unanticipated costs.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect our sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.\nOur business may be impacted by disruptions including, but not limited to, threats to physical security, information technology attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could impact our sales, increase our expenses or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price. We have developed and are implementing business continuity plans for each of our businesses, in order to mitigate the effects disruptions may have on our financial results.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.\nOur revenue, cash flows and quarterly results may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may in the future experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results attributable to a variety of factors. Such factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nChanges in demand for our products;\n\u2022\nIntroduction, enhancement or announcement of products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of our new products;\n\u2022\nThe growth rates of certain market segments in which we compete;\n\u2022\nSize, timing and shipment terms of significant orders;\n\u2022\nDifficulties with our technical programs;\n\u2022\nBudgeting cycles of customers;\n\u2022\nPricing pressures from customers;\n\u2022\nCustomer advances;\n\u2022\nLonger payment terms required by our customers;\n\u2022\nMix of distribution channels;\n\u2022\nMix of products and services sold;\n\u2022\nMix of domestic and international revenues;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nChanges in the level of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nChanges in our sales incentive plans;\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nInventory obsolescence;\n\u2022\nAccrual of contract losses;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in oil and utility costs;\n\u2022\nHealth care reform;\n\u2022\nCompletion or announcement of acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions in regions in which we conduct business.\nMost of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term, including costs of personnel and facilities, and are not easily reduced. Thus, an unexpected reduction in our revenue, or failure to achieve an anticipated rate of growth, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, our stock price may decline.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
