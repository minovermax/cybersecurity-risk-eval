{"cik": "7536", "company": "ARROW ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nDescribed below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industries in which it operates. If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, government regulation (including tax regulation), employee attraction and retention, and customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company.\nIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company's businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company's suppliers accounted for approximately 9% of the company's consolidated sales. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business. Further, the supplier landscape has experienced a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts.\nThe competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.\nThe company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, there is no guarantee that the company's response to and growth in emerging technologies will be successful. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.\nGlobal businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts. The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business. As a result, the company could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.\nProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.\nThe company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.\nDeclines in value of the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business.\nThe market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.\nTariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company's business and results of operations.\nRecently, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company's businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nIn addition, in the event that the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. In order to qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third-party sources, such as its suppliers. There is no guarantee the company will be able to obtain this additional data and documentation from those other sources, which could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Further, there are additional administrative costs expended by the company in furtherance of these efforts. Finally, due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds. The company\u2019s inability to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business.\nThe company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (\"U.S. Products\") are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including\nthe denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. For example, in 2019, the company determined that from 2015 to 2019 a limited number of non-executive employees, without first obtaining required authorization from the company or the United States government, had facilitated product shipments with an aggregate total invoiced value of approximately $4.8 million, to resellers for reexports to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company voluntarily reported these activities to OFAC and the United States Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d), conducted an internal investigation and terminated or disciplined the employees involved. The company has cooperated fully and intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties, which the company is currently not able to estimate.\nFurther, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, and contractors, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nThe company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business.\nA number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.\nSome environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (\"Wyle\") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.\nThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.\nThe company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $300.1 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed North America asset securitization program of $1.2 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $410.0 million at December 31, 2019. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control.\nThe company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings. Further, any increase in the company's level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current\ndebt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms. Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company's financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.\nThe agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.\nThe agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt; or\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.\nThe company's lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nMost of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.\nThe company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical.\nThe semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 49%, 45%, and 46%, of the company's consolidated sales in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.\nThe company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nIn 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 60%, 59%, and 58%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nimport and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u2022\npotential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\nimport and export tariffs, duties and value-added taxes;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nuncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations;\n\u2022\nforeign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nstringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nvolatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit;\n\u2022\npotential military conflicts and political risks; and\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.\nAlso, the company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increases as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, such risks could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nMoreover, the company's effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain international tax policy efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission's state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where the company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their tax policy and some have already passed tax legislation which affect international businesses. For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (\"Tax Act\"), which significantly changed the tax laws by favorably reducing the corporate federal tax rate (35% to 21%) and moving to a territorial system, while simultaneously imposing an unfavorable one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings, limiting deductibility of certain import related costs, including interest expense, and creating a new tax on certain international activities. Additionally, tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that have been estimated. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of the company's provision for taxes. Such tax changes, to the extent they are brought against the company, could increase the effective tax rates in many of the countries where the company has operations and ultimately could have an adverse effect on overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWhen the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.\nAs part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\neffectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;\n\u2022\nnot realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention;\n\u2022\nnegative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nFurther, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.\nThe company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines\nthat the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.\nFor example, during the second quarter of 2019, based in part on the company's downward revision of forecasted future earnings and the decision to wind down its personal computer and mobility asset disposition business, the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment analysis related to the Americas components and Asia-Pacific components reporting units. As a result of the impairment analysis, the company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $570.2 million. Additionally, the company recorded a non-cash trade name impairment charge of $46.0 million in connection with an initiative to further integrate two global components businesses.\nRefer to Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nA decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, or the company's inability to meet long term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company's reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company's consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North America asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nIf the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.\nThe company's success depends upon its key executives and the strategies they develop.\nAny failure to attract and retain necessary talent may materially and adversely affect the company's business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company's success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its senior management team. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience. The company may also need to offer better remuneration and other benefits to attract and retain key executives and therefore cannot be assured that costs and expenses will not increase significantly as a result of increased talent acquisition and retention cost.\nCyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company's business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.\nThe company's information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company's operations and/or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company's or any of its customer's or supplier's data, confidential information, or reputation. The company's information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error,\nmalfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company's data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company's information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company's business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company's information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company's operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nThe company makes investments seeking to address risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cybersecurity threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company's regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security threats as well as the company's plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.\nAlso, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company's failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others. Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against loss from cyber security and privacy risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nRestrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.\nRestrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company's business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws are changed or if new more restrictive government regulations are enacted or increased, the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase or operations may be disrupted.\nThe company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business.\nThe company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. The company relies on a global enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The company committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaced multiple legacy systems of the company. This conversion was extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally. To date, the company has not experienced any identifiable significant issues. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.\nThe company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nCertain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to\ntechnologies that are important to the company's business. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights. Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:\n\u2022\nresult in substantial cost to the company;\n\u2022\ndivert management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nbe time consuming to defend;\n\u2022\nresult in substantial damage awards; or\n\u2022\ncause product shipment delays.\nAdditionally, if an infringement claim is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.

Due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, there has been a substantial curtailment of travel and business activities, particularly to and from China. China has also limited the shipment of products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s ability to receive products from its China-based suppliers and its ability to ship products to customers in that region. In addition, the company has significant operations in China and it is uncertain how long the threat will last or when trade restrictions will be lifted. Further, the epidemic could have a negative impact on operations outside of China. Supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the company\u2019s sales in EMEA and North America. If not resolved quickly, the impact of the epidemic could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 29209, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "ARW"}
