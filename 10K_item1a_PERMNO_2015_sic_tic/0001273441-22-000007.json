{"cik": "1273441", "company": "GRAN TIERRA ENERGY INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business\nPrices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate significantly, which could cause temporary suspension of production and reduce our value\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from the sale of oil. The current and forward contract oil price is based on world demand, supply, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, geopolitical unrest, world health events and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. Historically, the market for oil has been volatile and is expected to remain so. During 2021, global oil and natural gas prices recovered from the historic lows and were scaling multi-year highs due to increased global demand for oil powered by worldwide economic growth as many countries are recovering from COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that oil prices in the near term will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as related macro-economic developments, such as supply chain and logistics disruptions, and their impact on both oil and natural gas supply and demand. Furthermore, prices which we receive for our oil sales, while based on international oil prices, are established by contracts with purchasers and include the deductions for transportation and quality differentials. The differentials and transportation costs can change over time and have a detrimental impact on realized prices.\nFuture decreases in the prices of oil, sustained low prices, periods of extended pricing volatility, and increasing borrowing costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the future results of our operations (including rendering existing projects unprofitable or requiring temporary suspension of Fields), financing available to us, and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis, as well as the market price for our securities.\nWe may be adversely affected by global epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 continued throughout 2021 including the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Worldwide economic climate continued to be volatile making accounting estimates more onerous. Despite the improvement in oil prices in 2021, this volatile economic climate has had and may in the future have significant adverse impacts on our Company including, but not exclusively:\n\u2022material declines in revenue and cash flows if commodity prices materially decline;\n\u2022extra operating and transportation costs related to COVID-19 health and safety preventative measures including incremental sanitation requirements and enhanced procedures for trucking barrels and crew changes in the field;\n\u2022declines in revenue and operating activities due to reduced capital programs and the shut-in of production;\n\u2022impairment charges;\n\u2022inability to comply with covenants and restrictions in debt agreements;\n\u2022inability to access financing sources;\n\u2022less capital available as financial institutions encounter investor and political pressure to reduce commitments to the fossil fuel industry;\n\u2022increased risk of non-performance by our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022supply chain issues;\n\u2022higher operating and transportation costs due to increased inflation rates;\n\u2022labour shortages; and\n\u2022interruptions in operations as we adjust personnel to the dynamic environment.\nThe situation is dynamic and the ultimate duration and magnitude of the impact on the economy and the financial effect on our Company is not fully known at this time.\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves may be inaccurate and our actual revenues may be lower than estimated\nWe make estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, upon which we base our financial projections and capital expenditure plans. We make these reserve estimates using various assumptions, including assumptions as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Some of these assumptions are inherently subjective, and the accuracy of our reserve estimates relies in part on the ability of our management team, engineers and other advisors to make accurate assumptions. Wells that are drilled may not achieve the results expected. Economic factors beyond our control, such as world oil prices, interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates, will also impact the quantity and value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, and requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. As a result, our reserves estimates are inherently imprecise. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10% or greater probability of being recovered. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, exploration and development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we estimate. Such changes could materially reduce our revenues and result in the impairment of our oil and natural gas interests.\nUnless we are able to replace our reserves and production, and develop and manage oil and natural gas reserves and production on an economically viable basis, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production.\nExploration, development and production costs (including operating and transportation costs), marketing costs (including distribution costs) and regulatory compliance costs (including taxes) will substantially impact the net revenues we derive from the oil and natural gas that we produce. These costs are subject to fluctuations and variations in the areas in which we operate, and we may not be able to predict or control these costs. If these costs exceed our expectations, this may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future reserves will depend not only on our ability to develop and effectively manage then-existing properties, but also on our ability to identify and acquire additional suitable producing properties or prospects, to identify and retain responsible service providers and contractors to efficiently drill and complete our wells and to find markets for the oil and natural gas we develop and to effectively distribute our production into our markets.\nExploration for oil and natural gas, and development of new formations, is risky\nOil and natural gas exploration involves a high degree of operational and financial risk. These risks are more acute in the early stages of exploration, appraisal and development. It is difficult to predict the results and project the costs of implementing an exploratory drilling program due to the inherent uncertainties and costs of drilling in unknown formations and encountering various drilling conditions, such as unexpected formations or pressures, premature decline of reservoirs, the invasion of water into producing formations, tools lost in the hole, and changes in drilling plans and locations as a result of prior exploratory wells or additional seismic data and interpretations thereof. Future oil and gas exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.\nOil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations, including, but not limited to, fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, sour gas releases, spills and other environmental hazards. Such risks and hazards could result in substantial damage to oil and natural gas wells, production facilities, other property or the environment, as well as personal injury to our employees, contractors or members of the public.\nLosses resulting from the occurrence of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough we maintain well control and liability insurance in an amount that we consider prudent and consistent with industry practice, liabilities associated with certain risks could exceed policy limits or not be covered. In either event we could incur significant costs.\nOur business is subject to local legal, social, security, political and economic factors that are beyond our control, which could impair or delay our ability to expand our operations or operate profitably\nAll of our proved reserves and production are currently located in Colombia; however, we may eventually expand to other countries. Exploration and production operations are subject to legal, social, security, political and economic uncertainties, including terrorism, social unrest and activism, illegal blockades, strikes by local or national labor groups, interference with private contract rights, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, exchange controls, changes in tax rates, changes in laws or policies affecting environmental issues (including land use and water use), workplace safety, foreign investment, foreign trade, investment or taxation, as well as restrictions imposed on the oil and natural gas industry, such as restrictions on production, price controls and export controls. When such disruptions occur, they may adversely impact our operations and threaten the economic viability of our projects or our ability to meet our production targets.\nBoth Colombia and Ecuador may experience future political and economic instability. Colombia has experienced social, economic and security turmoil related to security, guerilla and narcotrafficking. Political changes because of future electoral processes could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies, laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment, including but not limited to: the imposition of additional taxes; nationalization; changes in energy or environmental policies or the personnel administering them; changes in oil and natural gas pricing policies; and royalty changes or increases. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets or renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions and contracts. Any changes in the oil and gas or investment regulations and policies or a shift in political attitudes in Ecuador or Colombia are beyond our control and may significantly hamper our ability to expand our operations or operate our business at a profit. Colombia has investment protection treaties in place with the United States and Canada as well as a history of sanctity of contracts.\nOil production in Ecuador has recently been impacted by outages experienced by the nations two major pipelines (the Sistema de Oleoductos Trans Ecuadoriano (SOTE) and the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) pipelines) caused by physical damage from significant soil erosion in areas along the Coca river. While these pipelines have now been rerouted and are back in service, there remains some risk to GTE\u2019s ability to transport oil to market through these systems from future, unforeseen natural events that could again generate outages in the OCP and SOTE pipelines. Such events could include, but are not limited to, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and additional significant soil erosion. GTE mitigates this risk through the maintenance of surplus storage capacity at it\u2019s facilities (typically 3-days by design) and the optionality of trucking oil to points of sale.\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with geographically concentrated operations\nThe vast majority of our production comes from four Fields located in Colombia. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Cohembi Fields collectively generated 89% of our production and at December 31, 2021, these four Fields accounted for 84% of our proved reserves. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of, among other things, regional supply and demand factors including limitations on our ability to most profitably sell or market our oil to a smaller pool of potential buyers, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, community protests, guerrilla activities, processing or transportation capacity constraints, continued authorization by the government to explore and drill in these areas, severe weather events and the availability of drilling rigs and related equipment, facilities, personnel or services. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nWe rely on local infrastructure and the availability of transportation for storage and shipment of our products. This infrastructure, including storage and transportation facilities, is less developed than that in North America and may be insufficient for our needs at commercially acceptable terms in the localities in which we operate. Further, we operate in remote areas and may rely on helicopters, boats or other transportation methods. Some of these transport methods may result in increased levels of risk, including the risk of accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, and could lead to operational\ndelays which could affect our ability to add to our reserve base or produce oil and could have a significant impact on our reputation or cash flow. Additionally, some of this equipment is specialized and may be difficult to obtain in our areas of operations, which could hamper or delay operations, and could increase the cost of those operations. In 2021 we experienced national blockades which have negatively impacted our annual production from major Fields, such as Acordionero, Costayaco, Suroriente, Cumplidor and Moqueta. National blockades have been resolved at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced localized farmers\u2019 blockades directed at the Colombian government, which resulted in the Suroriente and PUT-7 Blocks being temporarily shut-in. These blockades were resolved in November 2021.\nSocial disruptions or community disputes in our areas of operations may delay production and result in lost revenue\nTo enjoy the support and trust of local populations and governments, we must demonstrate a commitment to providing local employment, training and business opportunities; a high level of environmental performance; open and transparent communication; and a willingness to discuss and address community issues including community development investments that are carefully selected, not unduly costly and bring lasting social and economic benefits to the community and the area. Improper management of these relationships could lead to a delay or suspension of operations, loss of license or major impact to our reputation in these communities, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot ensure that such issues or disruptions will not be experienced in the future and we cannot predict their potential impacts, which may include delays or loss of production, standby charges, stranded equipment, or damage to our facilities. We also cannot ensure that we will not experience protests or blockades erected by criminal groups or cultivators of illegal crops, in response to the Colombian government's eradication of such crops, if such crops are grown in proximity to roads required to access our operations. In addition, we must comply with legislative requirements for prior consultation with communities and ethnic groups who are affected by our proposed projects in Colombia and Ecuador. Notwithstanding our compliance with these requirements, we may be sued by such communities through a writ for protection of tutela in the Colombian courts for enhanced consultation, potentially leading to increased costs, operational delays and other impacts. In addition, several areas in Colombia have conducted Popular Consultations and essential referendums on extractive industries. The referendums were organized by opponents of the mining or oil and natural gas industries. It remains unclear to what extent such results can impact the exercise of mineral rights conferred by the national government.\nSecurity concerns in Colombia or Ecuador may disrupt our operations\nOil pipelines have historically been primary targets of terrorist activity in Colombia. Although a Peace Agreement was ratified by Colombian government in 2016, the result of which was the demobilization and disarmament of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), there continue to be examples of violence against pipelines and other infrastructure that has been attributed to former FARC dissident groups and other illegal groups. It is not currently known whether or to what degree violence will continue and whether and to what degree that violence may impact our operations. Notwithstanding the Peace Agreement ratified and the ongoing efforts to implement such Agreements, increased eradication by the Colombian government of illicit crops, as well as the continuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent activity of guerrilla dissidents and of farmers, such efforts may not be successful and such activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future or cause us higher security costs and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nColombia and Ecuador have experienced social turmoil related to changes in economic policy, which have resulted in illegal blockades to roads throughout the countries, and illegal invasions to private property and impacting regions where company activities are located. While blockages have been historically directed at the State, the resulting impact may hinder our ability to mobilize oil, personnel and equipment, resulting in temporary shut-in of production or negatively impacting Company assets.\nColombia and Ecuador also both have a history of security problems. Our efforts to ensure the security of our personnel and physical assets may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our Field personnel or our contractors\u2019 Field personnel and our Bogota and Quito head office personnel or operations in Colombia and Ecuador or that this violence will not adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss. If these security problems disrupt our operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAll of our revenue is generated outside of Canada and the United States, and if we determine to, or are required to, repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions, we could be subject to taxes\nAll of our revenue is generated outside of Canada and the United States. The cash generated from operations abroad is generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds are repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate further funds, other than to pay head office charges, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be\npermanently reinvested and a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.\nThe threat and impact of cyberattacks may adversely impact our operations and could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss\nWe use digital technologies and software programs to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, as well as to process and record financial and operating data. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to store, transmit, process and record sensitive information (including trade secrets, employee information and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. The complexities of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information attractive to thieves. Our business processes depend on the availability, capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs and therefore it is critical to our business that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure. While we have implemented strategies to mitigate impacts from these types of events, we cannot guarantee that measures taken to defend against cybersecurity threats will be sufficient for this purpose. The ability of the information technology function to support our business in the event of a security breach or a disaster such as fire or flood and our ability to recover key systems and information from unexpected interruptions cannot be fully tested and there is a risk that, if such an event actually occurs, we may not be able to address immediately the repercussions of the breach or disaster. In that event, key information and systems may be unavailable for a number of days or weeks, leading to our inability to conduct business or perform some business processes in a timely manner. Moreover, if any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails to misappropriate information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information through email or download malware. Despite our efforts to mitigate \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails through policies and education, \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d activities remain a serious problem that may damage our information technology infrastructure.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures, and we may not have the resources necessary to fund these expenditures\nOur base capital program for 2022 is $220.0 million to $240.0 million for exploration and development activities. We expect to fund our 2022 capital program through cash flows from operations. Funding this program from cash flow from operations relies in part on Brent oil prices being at least $60 per barrel or greater. For the period from January 1 to February 18, 2022, the average price of Brent oil was $88.34 per barrel.\nIf cash flows from operations, cash on hand and available capacity under our credit facility are not sufficient to fund our capital program, we may be required to seek external financing or to delay or reduce our exploration and development activities, which could impact production, revenues and reserves.\nIf we require additional capital, we may pursue sources of capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing or other means. We may not be able to access capital on favorable terms or at all. If we do succeed in raising additional capital, future financings may be dilutive to our shareholders, as we could issue additional shares of common stock or other equity to investors. In addition, debt and other mezzanine financing may involve a pledge of assets, require covenants that would restrict our business activities, and may be senior to interests of equity holders. We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertibles and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by factors such as weak capital markets (both generally and for the oil and gas industry in particular), the location of our oil and natural gas properties, including in Colombia and Ecuador, low or declining prices of oil and natural gas on the commodities markets, and the loss of key management. Further, if oil or natural\ngas prices on the commodities markets decrease, then our revenues will likely decrease, and such decreased revenues may increase our requirements for capital. Some of the contractual arrangements governing our exploration activity may require us to commit to certain capital expenditures, and we may lose our contract rights if we do not have the required capital to fulfill these commitments. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our cash flows from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even to the extent that we reduce our activities), we may be required to curtail our operations.\nCertain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, have promoted the divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressured lenders to cease or limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, including recent divestment actions by several prominent New York State and New York public employee pension funds. Such environmental initiatives aimed at targeting climate changes could ultimately interfere with our access to capital and ability to finance our operations.\nA failure to meet goals or evolving stakeholder expectations of ESG practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact employee retention, customer relationships, and access to capital. For example, certain market participants use third party benchmarks or scores to measure a company\u2019s ESG practices in making investment decisions and customers and suppliers may evaluate our ESG practices or require that we adopt certain ESG policies as a condition of awarding contracts.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced by the lenders, which could prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $150.0 million, of which $125.0 million is presently eligible for borrowing and $25.0 million is subject to approval by majority lenders. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders twice per year, with the next re-determination to occur no later than May 2022. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of a decline in oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, lenders willingness to lend to the oil and gas industry, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base, which would deplete cash flow from operations or require additional financing.\nFurther, our borrowing base is made available to us subject to the terms and covenants of our revolving credit facility, including compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility, and a failure to comply with such ratios or covenants could force us to repay a portion of our borrowings and suffer adverse financial impacts. We are required to maintain compliance with the following financial covenants: limitations on the Company\u2019s ratio of debt to EBITDAX to a maximum of 4.0; limitations on the Company\u2019s ratio of Senior Secured Debt to EBITDAX to a maximum of 3.0; and the maintenance of a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5.\nIf we fail to comply with these financial covenants, it would result in a default under the terms of the credit agreement, which could result in an acceleration of repayment of all indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. An event of default under the revolving credit facility would result in a default under the indentures governing our senior notes, which could allow the note holders to require us to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes. Based on the Brent price and production levels used in 2022 outlook, management expects to be in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility agreement.\nCertain LIBOR benchmarks will no longer be published after December 31, 2021. We expect the LIBOR benchmark to be replaced with risk-free rates. Debt, hedging costs, valuations, and internal financial models are all examples of areas that will be impacted by the transition to alternative reference rates. The transition can potentially impact our intercompany lending, late payment provisions in commercial contacts, structured financing transactions, and other LIBOR referencing contracts outside of our normal banking agreements. The transition of the LIBOR rate to alternative reference rates may potentially increase our lending costs.\nOur revolving credit facility matures in November 2022. Capital financing may not be available to us at economic rates.\nOur revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in November 2022. There can be no assurance that financial market conditions or borrowing terms at the time our revolving credit facility is renegotiated will be as favorable as the current terms\nand interest rates. We may be unable to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or other purposes.\nForeign currency exchange rate volatility may affect our financial results\nWe sell our oil and natural gas production under agreements that are denominated mainly in U.S. dollars. Many of the operational and other expenses we incur, including current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in Colombia, are denominated in Colombian pesos. Most of our administration costs in Canada are incurred in Canadian dollars. As a result, we are exposed to translation risk when local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars, our functional currency. An appreciation of local currencies can increase our costs and negatively impact our results from operations. Because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. We are also exposed to transaction risk on settlement of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are dependent on obtaining and maintaining permits and licenses from various governmental authorities\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous licenses, permits, approvals and certificates, including environmental and other operating permits. We may not be able to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on a timely basis or at all. We may also have licenses and permits rescinded or may not be able to renew expiring licenses and permits. Failure or delay in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals or permits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and explore on our properties, and receipt of drilling permits with onerous conditions could increase our compliance costs. Loss of permits for existing drilling, water injection or other activities necessary for production may result in a decline of our production levels and revenues or damage to the well structure. Regulations and policies relating to these licenses and permits may change, be implemented in a way that we do not currently anticipate or take significantly greater time to obtain. There can be no assurance that future political conditions in Colombia and Ecuador will not result in changes to policies with respect to foreign development and ownership of oil, environmental protection, health and safety or labor relations, which may negatively affect our ability to undertake exploration and development activities in respect of present and future properties, as well as our ability to raise funds to further such activities.\nAs we are not the operator of all the joint ventures we are currently involved in, we may rely on the operator to obtain all necessary permits and licenses. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be prevented from drilling for oil and natural gas, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or fines. Revocation or suspension of our environmental and operating permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulation and risks may adversely affect our business\nEnvironmental regulation is stringent and the costs and expenses of regulatory compliance are increasing. All phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to an extensive suite of international conventions and national and regional laws and regulations. Environmental legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various substances used or produced in association with oil and gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties. Our operations create the risk of significant environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water or for certain other environmental impacts. There is uncertainty around the impact of environmental laws and regulations, including those presently in force and those expected to be proposed in the future. We cannot predict how future environmental laws will be interpreted, administered or enforced, but more stringent laws or regulations or more vigorous enforcement policies could in the future require material expenditures by us for the installation and operation of compliant systems; therefore it is impossible at this time to predict the nature and impact of those requirements on our company however they may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nGiven the nature of our business, there are inherent risks of oil spills at drilling or operations sites due to operational failure, accidents, sabotage, pipeline failure or tampering or escape of oil due to the transportation of the oil by truck. All of these may lead to significant potential environmental liabilities, such as damages, litigation costs, clean-up costs or penalties, some of which may be material and for which our insurance coverage maybe inadequate or unavailable.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under anti-bribery laws and a finding that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws in the United States, Canada, Ecuador and Colombia and will be subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions where we may operate in the future. We may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, international organizations, or private entities. As a result, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, contractors, agents, and partners of ours or our subsidiaries or affiliates, given that these parties are not always subject to our control or direction. It is our policy to prohibit these practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements to those measures may prove to be less than effective or may not be followed, and our employees, contractors, agents, and partners may engage in illegal conduct for which we might be held responsible. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, may result in criminal or civil sanctions or other penalties (including profit disgorgement) as well as reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf the United States imposes sanctions on Colombia or Ecuador in the future, our business may be adversely affected\nColombia is among several nations whose eligibility to receive foreign aid from the United States is dependent on its progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs, which is subject to an annual review by the President of the United States. Although Colombia is currently eligible for such aid, Colombia may not remain eligible in the future. A finding by the President that Colombia has failed demonstrably to meet its obligations under international counter-narcotic agreements may result in the imposition of economic and trade sanctions on Colombia which could result in adverse economic consequences in Colombia including potentially threatening our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop our Colombian properties, and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with our operations there.\nRegulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business, including demand for our products, our financial condition and results of operations\nGovernments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner. GHG emissions legislation is emerging and is subject to change. For example, on an international level, in December 2015, almost 200 nations, including Colombia, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d), that calls for countries to set their own GHG emission targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emission targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how this legislation or any new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Current GHG emissions legislation has not resulted in material compliance costs; however, emissions, carbon and other regulations impacting climate and climate related matters are constantly evolving. It is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted, and any such future laws and regulations could result in additional compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. If we are unable to recover a significant amount of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant restrictions on GHG emissions could result in decreased demand for the oil that we produce, with a resulting decrease in the value of our reserves. Further, there have been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community to consider climate change in how they invest in companies. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk; this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital. Increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the company\u2019s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. Finally, although we strive to operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earth\u2019s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nShares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE American, the TSX and the London Stock Exchange (\u201cLSE\u201d) and investors seeking to take advantage of price differences between such markets may create unexpected volatility in market prices\nShares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE American, the TSX and the LSE. While the Common Stock is traded on such markets, the price and volume levels could fluctuate significantly on any market independently of the price or trading volume on other markets. Investors could seek to sell or purchase shares of Common Stock to take advantage of any price differences between the NYSE American, the TSX and the LSE through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in the price of the Common Stock on any of these exchanges or the volume of Common Stock available for trading on any of these markets. In addition, shareholders in any of these jurisdictions will not be able to transfer such shares of Common Stock for trading on another market without effecting necessary procedures with our transfer agent or registrar. This could result in time delays and additional cost for shareholders of the Common Stock.\nIf we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our shares of Common Stock\nOur shares of Common Stock are currently listed on the NYSE American, and the continued listing of our shares is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with these continued listing standards, including if the price our shares of Common Stock remains at its current low for a substantial period of time and we fail to effect a reverse stock split upon notice from the NYSE, our shares of Common Stock may be delisted. A delisting of our shares could negatively impact us by, among other things reducing the liquidity of our shares and limiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursuant strategic transactions.", "PERMNO": 92619, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GTE"}
