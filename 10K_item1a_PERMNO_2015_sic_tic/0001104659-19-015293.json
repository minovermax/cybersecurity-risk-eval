Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties. If any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially harmed. These factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing, Regulatory Approval, and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our products and clinical product candidates and we cannot provide any assurance that any of our product candidates will be approved, commercialized, or successfully marketed in the future.\nTo date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our clinical drug candidates, which we plan to advance through clinical development. Our future success depends heavily on our ability to successfully manufacture, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize these products and product candidates, which may never occur. We currently generate no income from our clinical product candidates, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug from those clinical product candidates.\nBefore we generate any income from sales of our products or product candidates in the United States or elsewhere, we must complete preclinical and clinical development, conduct human subject research, submit clinical and manufacturing data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA (or foreign equivalent), qualify a third-party contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, satisfy the FDA that our CMO is capable of manufacturing the product in compliance with the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practices, or CGMPs, submit a marketing application (e.g., Biologics License Application, or BLA (or foreign equivalent), or New Drug Application, or NDA (or foreign equivalent)), receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency, build a commercial organization, make substantial investments, and undertake significant marketing efforts ourselves or in partnership with others to ensure compliant marketing and market acceptance of any products we commercialize. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for some of our product candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that any further BLAs, NDAs or MAAs will be filed within a specified period of time, or that any BLA or NDA or similar foreign marketing application will allow us to obtain or maintain marketing approval. In addition, any marketing approval we may obtain may be for uses more limited than we expect or include contraindications or risk measures that limit market acceptance of the product subject to the marketing approval. We also cannot be certain that our products or product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or that the clinical trials or data will support filing any further BLAs or NDAs in the U.S., or similar foreign marketing applications elsewhere. We also cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval for trial initiation. Further, the FDA, an independent review committee, or IRC, or an oncologic drugs advisory committee, or ODAC, may not agree with the interpretation by our investigators or us of the clinical safety and efficacy of our product candidates and our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our income will be dependent, in part, upon the prescribing information, adoption within clinical practice guidelines, and the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. In addition, our income will be dependent, in part, upon the market acceptance of our products once approved, as well as upon reimbursement and coverage, among other things. If the markets for patient subsets that we plan to target are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant income from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe do not have the resources to conduct and directly oversee our product development programs without assistance from third parties. In the execution of our product development programs, we may have to rely on collaborations with clinical partners as well as clinical research organizations, or CROs, CMOs, vendors and other service providers. Failure of these entities to satisfactorily conduct clinical research or to provide the services requested by us may negatively impact our product development programs, including but not limited to program delays or preventing approval of our product candidates. We plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and potentially in the European Union and additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory review and approval can be similar in other countries, to obtain separate regulatory review and approval in many other\ncountries, we must comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries, including those regarding safety and efficacy, clinical trials, manufacturing, post-marketing commitments, and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nIf the incidence and/or prevalence of diseases, or disease areas, we are targeting for development and/or commercialization, and further growth, are low, including lower than our estimates or estimates of third-parties, this could significantly delay patient enrollment in our ongoing or future clinical trials and/or could negatively impact commercial revenue. The true incidence and/or prevalence as well as market potential can be difficult to determine, ahead of commercial launch, for certain rare diseases, such as BPDCN, for which there had been limited epidemiologic and published data, and databases, and no previous drug approvals and no prior product revenue data. Additionally, due to the unfamiliarity and/or rarity of certain diseases, such as BPDCN, health care providers may not be aware and/or may misdiagnose or underdiagnose such diseases leading to low trial enrollment and/or product revenue. Our disease awareness campaign, intended to raise awareness of the disease and increase patient identification, could fail to do so for many reasons. At this time, we have no way of assuring the accuracy of any incidence/prevalence or revenue numbers, or the chances for revenue growth into related areas, thus if these are low, despite expectations to the contrary, this will negatively impact our revenue and future prospects for the company.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take a substantial amount of time to complete. Its outcome is inherently uncertain. In addition, failure can occur at any time during clinical development, including after significant resources have been invested. We cannot predict whether we will encounter challenges with any of our clinical trials that will cause us, or regulatory authorities, to delay, suspend or terminate current or future trials.\nClinical trials can be delayed or halted for many reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 delays or failures in reaching an agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CMOs, CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly depending on the circumstances;\n\u00b7 failure of our third-party contractors, including CROs and CMOs, or our investigators, to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet contractual obligations in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 delays or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators, institutional review boards, or IRBs, or scientific review committees, or SRCs, in order to commence or continue a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 our inability to manufacture, or obtain from third-parties, adequate supply of drug substance, drug product or adjuvant therapies sufficient to complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 risk of loss of drug product, adjuvants and/or other components of the product, due to third-party storage and distribution of such supplies;\n\u00b7 the FDA, or other regulatory authority, issuing a clinical hold or requiring alterations to any of our study designs, including extending a study or requiring new studies, to our overall strategy or to our manufacturing plans;\n\u00b7 delays in patient enrollment, variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials, poor accrual, or high drop-out rates of patients in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial and our inability to add new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u00b7 poor effectiveness of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u00b7 safety issues, including serious adverse events associated with our product candidates and patient exposure to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 receipt by a competitor of marketing approval for a product targeting an indication that one of our product candidates targets, such that we are not \u201cfirst to market\u201d with our product candidate;\n\u00b7 governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory leadership, requirements, policy and guidelines;\n\u00b7 differing interpretations of data by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities; or\n\u00b7 the FDA, or similar regulatory body, may not agree with the endpoints we select or the interpretation of the results related to the endpoints in the evaluation of our product candidates, thereby refusing to approve our product candidates for marketing approval, or withdrawing approval.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRB where such trial is being conducted, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, if one is utilized for any such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including, among other things, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, regulatory violations identified during an inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site, imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, study subject safety concerns, adverse events or severe adverse events, including deaths, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. For example, we have observed serious adverse events, including deaths, from or relating to capillary leak syndrome, or CLS, with ELZONRIS. The occurrence of these and other adverse events could jeopardize or preclude our ability to develop ELZONRIS in additional indications including CMML, obtain or maintain marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, market, and sell any or all of our product candidates for one or more indications.\nWe have also advanced SL-801, SL-701 and SL-901 into clinical trials. There are unknown risks for these product candidates, including with respect to dosing, administration, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, safety and efficacy, that we expect we will learn about during clinical development which could halt or delay this development program and/or alter our current strategy for the development of this product candidate.\nWe may not have the necessary expertise or capabilities, including adequate staffing, to successfully manage the execution and completion of any of our clinical trials, prepare clinical study reports and marketing authorization applications, and ultimately obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn any clinical trial of a product candidate, the results of such trial may not be adequate to support submission of a marketing application or marketing approval. Because our product candidates are intended for use in life-threatening diseases, in many cases we ultimately intend to seek marketing approval for each product candidate based on the results of a single clinical trial, which may be open-label and single-group in nature. As a result, these trials may receive enhanced scrutiny from the FDA. For any such trial, if the FDA disagrees with our choice or definition of primary endpoint, or the results for the primary endpoint are not robust or significant or clinically beneficial enough, including relative to a control or historical data, the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or NDA based on such intended pivotal trial, despite meeting a primary endpoint of the study. In addition, the results of any such intended pivotal trial may be subject to confounding factors, or may not be adequately supported by other study endpoints, possibly including overall survival, or OS, overall response rate, or ORR, rate of complete response, or CR, rate of clinical complete response, or CRc, and/or response duration, in which case the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or NDA based on such intended pivotal trial, despite meeting a primary endpoint of the study. The FDA may also require the completion of additional clinical trials before or as a condition for approving our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or a termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, which will have a negative impact on our ability to commence product sales and generate product income from any of our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs and slow down our product candidate development and approval process and may negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital to support these increased costs. Delays in completing our clinical trials could also allow our competitors to obtain marketing approval before we do, or could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nReports of adverse events or other safety concerns involving ELZONRIS and our clinical drug candidates could delay clinical development, delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals, or negatively impact sales or the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nReports of adverse events or other safety concerns involving ELZONRIS and our clinical drug candidates could interrupt, delay or halt our clinical trials. For example, CLS is a known, sometimes fatal, and well-documented side effect of ELZONRIS. Reports of additional CLS cases, or other adverse events or other safety concerns involving ELZONRIS or our other product candidates, could result in clinical trial delays including regulatory authorities placing trials on clinical hold or denying or withdrawing approval for trials of any or all indications. Further, patients receiving ELZONRIS or our other product candidates with co-morbid diseases and/or\nindications not previously well-studied may experience new or different serious adverse events in the future. Likewise, reports of adverse events or other safety concerns involving ELZONRIS or our other product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt ongoing or planned clinical trials of such product candidates, could require redesign of study protocols and conduct of additional trials, could result in our inability to file for or obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, or negatively impact commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nResults of earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials.\nThe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including early stage, late stage, and investigator-sponsored clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of subsequent later stage clinical trials, including corporate sponsored trials. Product candidates in later stage or larger clinical trials may fail to show the safety and efficacy results demonstrated in earlier studies despite having progressed through preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials, including canceling clinical development programs, due to adverse safety profiles or lack of efficacy, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Similarly, our clinical trials may not be successful for these or other reasons.\nThis drug development risk is heightened by any changes in ongoing and future clinical trials compared to completed clinical trials. As product candidates are advanced through preclinical studies to early and late stage clinical trials and towards approval and commercialization, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing and methods of administration and dosing, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. While these types of changes are common and are intended to optimize the product candidates for later stage clinical trials, approval and commercialization, such changes do carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. For example, the results of our ongoing and future clinical trials may be adversely affected by the following changes:\n\u00b7 As we optimize and scale-up production of our clinical drug candidates, there may be manufacturing, formulation, fill-finish and other process and analytical changes that are part of the optimization and scale-up necessary for producing drug substance and drug product of a quality, quantity and stability sufficient for later stage clinical development and commercialization. Delays, including failures, in any of these steps may delay initiation and completion of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, or commercial launch. We may also need to demonstrate comparability between newly manufactured drug substances and/or drug products relative to previously manufactured drug substances and/or drug products. Demonstrating comparability may cause us to incur additional costs or delay initiation or completion of our clinical trials, including the need or choice to initiate a dose escalation study, and, if unsuccessful, could require us to complete additional preclinical or clinical studies of our product candidates. Failure to demonstrate comparability could also result in delays in regulatory submissions or commercial launch. We are also developing a new lyophilized formulation of ELZONRIS. In the event it does not demonstrate adequacy or comparability with the current liquid/frozen formulation, ELZONRIS could be negatively impacted.\n\u00b7 We have changed the treatment regimen of ELZONRIS to a multi-cycle regimen, in which patients will receive more than one treatment cycle, rather than a single-cycle treatment as used in the completed investigator-initiated clinical trial. Although we anticipate that patients receiving multiple cycles of ELZONRIS may derive greater clinical benefit than from a single cycle, there is a risk of toxicity or a lack of efficacy arising from multiple cycles.\n\u00b7 We are, or may in the future be, treating patients with certain diseases or conditions that have not been previously treated with our product candidates. In these instances, we may choose to treat patients at several different doses and use multi-cycle dosing regimens to determine the optimal doses and schedules for both near-term and long-term safety and disease control in each indication. Use of our product candidates in new disease populations and at new dosing regimens could produce unforeseen adverse reactions and events that could impact the development and ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval for our product candidates.\n\u00b7 We may determine, based on safety and efficacy, that certain doses and regimens of our product candidates for particular indications are optimal for initial near-term therapy whereas the same, or other, doses and regimens are optimal for longer-term maintenance therapy.\n\u00b7 We are developing SL-701 as an injection administered under the skin, or subcutaneously, in our trials. Two previous investigator-sponsored trials of an earlier version of SL-701 used this method of delivery. Another previous investigator-sponsored trial of an earlier version of SL-701 used a different method of delivery, in which dendritic cells, which are a type of immune cell, were removed from the patient, exposed to immunogenic peptides, and then re-injected into or near a lymph node of the patient (intra/peri-nodally). Our plan continues with the subcutaneous injection method used in two of the previous studies and represents a change from one of the other previous studies.\n\u00b7 We manufactured and formulated SL-701 as a mixture of IL-13Ra2 mutant peptide, EphA2 peptide, a new survivin mutant peptide, and a tetanus toxoid peptide. An earlier version of this immunotherapy, which included IL-13Ra2 mutant and EphA2 peptides, was mixed with additional peptides in previous studies, including a different survivin peptide in some studies.\n\u00b7 In the initial stage of our SL-701 corporate-sponsored trial, we used granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, and imiquimod as the immunostimulants. In the second stage of our SL-701 trial, we used poly-ICLC as the immunostimulant, which was the immunostimulant used, along with an earlier version of SL-701, in the previous investigator-sponsored study but is not currently commercially available. If the poly-ICLC regimen is found to be superior, it would require successful approval and commercialization of poly-ICLC in addition to SL-701 to support product launch, which would entail a more complicated regulatory and commercialization strategy than required for a single product launch.\n\u00b7 In some of our current or future trials, we are, or may, combine our product candidates with each other or with other therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or anti-angiogenic therapy which could result in unforeseen toxicities. We are currently combining ELZONRIS with pomalidomide in myeloma and have combined SL-701 with bevacizumab and immunostimulants in brain cancer.\nAny of the aforementioned, or other, changes could make the timing, including initiation, patient accrual, or results of our clinical trials less predictable and could cause our product candidates to perform differently, including causing toxicities, which could delay or suspend completion of our clinical trials, delay or prevent approval of our product candidates, and/or jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval, commence product sales and generate income.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials, including as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved or may commence competing clinical trials for the indications we are investigating.\nSome of our product candidates are being developed in orphan indications (i.e., rare diseases) with small available study populations. There are very limited independently reported data on annual incidences of these orphan indications. If the prevalence of these diseases is very low, including lower than our estimates or estimates of our third-party contractors, this could significantly delay patient enrollment in any one or more of our ongoing or future clinical trials.\nFurther, if we fail to enroll and maintain the number of patients for which the clinical trial was designed, the statistical power of that clinical trial may be reduced, which would make it harder to demonstrate that the product candidate being tested in such clinical trial is safe and effective. Additionally, enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays to, or may require us to terminate or not initiate, one or more clinical trials.\nThe regulatory review and approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities, which could include the prerequisite of an advisory panel, e.g. ODAC, review. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of preclinical, CMC, clinical pharmacology, and clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development, and may vary among jurisdictions. We may be required to undertake and complete certain additional preclinical, CMC, clinical pharmacology, bioanalytical, immunogenicity, or clinical studies to generate additional data required to support the submission of an IND, a BLA, or an NDA to the FDA or equivalent applications to comparable foreign authorities. An inadequacy in any of these areas, or a lack of personnel, financial resources or performance, including by third parties, could result in a delayed or unsuccessful regulatory filing. For example, we intend to have a meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development of ELZONRIS in CMML and potentially other indications. The FDA feedback may be difficult to implement or not implementable at all. Also, the FDA may require additional studies to support regulatory approval, which could result in a delay in our clinical programs and/or a delay or unsuccessful or no regulatory filing.\nWe have only obtained FDA regulatory approval for one drug product, ELZONRIS, and it is possible that none of our other existing product candidates, additional indications for ELZONRIS, or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Furthermore, approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA.\nOur product candidates, alone or in combination with any adjuvant, immunostimulant including GM-CSF or Imiquimod or poly-ICLC, or other agents with which we may combine our drug candidates, could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, conduct or findings of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may identify protocol deviations or data quality or integrity concerns with our preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from, or the study design or execution of, preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept our definition, or criteria, for the primary endpoints and/or other endpoints for evaluation of efficacy and clinical benefit to patients and may withhold marketing approval, despite meeting the primary endpoint of a trial;\n\u00b7 the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA, an NDA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u00b7 we may fail to secure an appropriate right of reference to the data from preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates that we did not conduct or sponsor;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we currently contract for clinical supplies and plan to contract for commercial supplies;\n\u00b7 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve any companion diagnostics we develop; and\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy and costly review process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates that we may advance into and through clinical trials, which would significantly harm our business.\nIn addition, even after obtaining approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing commitments, including additional clinical trials, observational studies, and/or pregnancy registries, which could impact market adoption and acceptance and exceed commercialization budgets. Regulatory authorities may also approve a product candidate with a label that includes labeling claims that may be undesirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, including product contraindications, warnings or precautions, the need for inpatient versus outpatient administration, or limitations on the administration schedule, such as the number of infusions or cycles. In addition, we may not be able to ultimately achieve the price we intend to charge for our product candidates or obtain satisfactory reimbursement or coverage for our product candidates. Moreover, in many foreign countries, a\nproduct candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country and the reimbursement may be suboptimal. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of product candidates includes the targeting of cancer stem cells (CSC), which is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value.\nResearch on CSCs is an emerging field and, consequently, there is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of CSCs as an underlying cause of tumor initiation, propagation, recurrence, resistance, and metastasis. In addition, there is some debate in the scientific community regarding the defining characteristics of these cells.\nAlthough there is a general consensus that some cancer cells have tumor-initiating capacity, there also is some debate in the scientific community regarding the defining characteristics and the origin of these cells. Some believe that normal adult stem cells transform into CSCs. Others believe that normal tumor bulk can transform into CSCs and, therefore, a definitive CSC cannot be readily isolated or targeted. In addition, some believe that targeting CSCs should be sufficient for a positive clinical outcome, while others believe that, at times or always, targeting CSCs should be coupled with targeting tumor bulk for a positive clinical outcome.\nBased on preclinical and clinical data, we believe that, for some cancers, ELZONRIS may target both tumor bulk and CSCs. However, it is conceivable that ELZONRIS and any other product candidates that we develop may not effectively target tumor bulk or CSCs or, even if they do, they may not have a beneficial or durable clinical outcome that outweighs the risks associated with the product. In addition, it is conceivable that our platform technology may ultimately fail to identify commercially viable drugs to treat human patients with cancer or any other disease or condition.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives may be impaired.\nAlthough we expect to focus a substantial amount of our efforts on the continued clinical testing and regulatory interactions for our clinical stage drug candidates, another key element of our strategy is to identify and test additional compounds. A portion of the preclinical research that we are conducting involves new and unproven drug discovery methods, including our proprietary StemScreen\u00ae platform technology, as well as the preclinical testing of new compounds and potential new uses of existing compounds. The drug discovery that we are conducting using our StemScreen\u00ae platform technology may not be successful in identifying compounds that are useful in treating humans with cancer. Research programs designed to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Even if our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, they may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7 competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;\n\u00b7 a product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful effects, to have characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be safe and effective, or to otherwise fail to meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u00b7 a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u00b7 a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by regulatory authorities, patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf we are unable to identify additional compounds for preclinical and clinical development, we may not sufficient any product income, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nIf we obtain approval to market any products outside of the U.S., a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf ELZONRIS is approved for marketing outside of the U.S., we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market these products in certain jurisdictions. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to international operations or entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u00b7 different regulatory requirements for drug approvals and rules governing drug commercialization in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 reduced or no protection over intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7 compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7 foreign reimbursement, pricing, and insurance regimes;\n\u00b7 foreign taxes;\n\u00b7 foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7 workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u00b7 potential noncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, or similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions as well as various regulations pertaining to data privacy, such as the GDPR;\n\u00b7 production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u00b7 business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires.\nAlso, see the Risk Factor titled \u201cInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.\u201d We have no prior experience in these countries, and many biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their products in foreign countries to be very challenging.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.\nPart of our business strategy involves international expansion, including establishing and maintaining operations outside of the U.S. and establishing and maintaining relationships with health care providers, payors, government officials, distributors and manufacturers globally. Conducting business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 multiple conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u00b7 possible failure by us or our distributors to obtain appropriate licenses or regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our product candidates, if approved, in various countries;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 complexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;\n\u00b7 financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, economic instability, or natural disasters, including, but not limited to, wars and terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, earthquakes, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;\n\u00b7 failure to comply with foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data, including the European Union General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data of individuals within the European Union; and\n\u00b7 failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions, for example by failing to maintain accurate information and control over sales or distributors\u2019 activities.\nAlso, see the Risk Factor titled \u201cIf we obtain approval to market any products outside of the U.S., a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\u201d Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to ongoing FDA regulatory requirements, related to ELZONRIS and our product candidates, both before and after regulatory approval, which requires significant resources. Additionally, our products and product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny additional regulatory approvals that we or our potential strategic partners may receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, may contain product contraindications, warnings, or precautions that limit the use of our product candidates or may contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. In addition, with regard to ELZONRIS or any product candidates, should they become approved by the FDA, the manufacturing processes, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, field alert or biological product deviation reporting, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory compliance requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs for commercial manufacturing and good clinical practices, or GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. For example, we have several post-marketing commitments related to the FDA approval of ELZONRIS. In addition, there are now and may be in the future manufacturing, formulation, fill-finish and other process and analytical changes required by the FDA related to producing drug substance and drug product of a quality, quantity and stability sufficient for commercial supply. Changes, delays or failures in any of these steps may negatively affect disposition of manufactured batches of drug substance and/or drug product and as a result may require production of additional batches of drug substance and/or drug product. Problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;\n\u00b7 warning letters, untitled letters, or holds on clinical trials;\n\u00b7 refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import and export of products;\n\u00b7 investigations or inspections by government entities, including, but not limited to, FDA or foreign health authorities; and\n\u00b7 injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, or the imposition of other civil penalties or criminal penalties.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of ELZONRIS and the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to fully establish or implement our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities in a timely manner, or are unable to enter into licensing or collaboration agreements for these purposes, we may not be successful in commercializing our products or product candidates.\nWe have built our own commercial infrastructure to commercialize ELZONRIS, and potentially our product candidates, and may potentially enter into contract research, contract sales, licensing or collaboration agreements to assist in the future development and commercialization of such product candidates.\nTo develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, we would have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which would be committed prior to knowing that our clinical drug candidates were approved. For product candidates for which we decide to perform sales, marketing, and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional risks, including:\n\u00b7 our inability to recruit, train, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or effectively promote our approved products to physicians and other providers;\n\u00b7 the lack of complementary drug products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u00b7 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating internal sales and marketing organizations;\n\u00b7 our inability to build our own manufacturing and commercial infrastructures to manufacture, market and sell our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our inability to build and staff, or enter into a partnership to support, commercial distribution organizations; and\n\u00b7 the addressable market for our product candidates may result in unsatisfactory income.\nWhere and when appropriate, we may elect to utilize contract sales forces or strategic partners to assist in the commercialization of product candidates for which we might receive marketing approval. If we enter into arrangements with third-parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services for our products, the resulting revenues or the profitability from these revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we had sold, marketed and distributed our products ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third-parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have limited control over such third-parties, and any of these third-parties may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell, market and distribute our products effectively and may engage in conduct that subjects us to significant regulatory enforcement action, as well as civil and criminal liability. For those products that we commercialize on our own and build our own sales and marketing organization, there is also a risk that our employees may engage in conduct that subjects us to significant regulatory enforcement action, as well as civil and criminal liability. The sale of drug products is subject to numerous regulatory and legal restrictions on promotional statements that may be made regarding a product\u2019s benefits and risks, in addition to certain restrictions and limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully and in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, either on our own or in collaboration with third-parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of ELZONRIS and our clinical drug candidates, if approved, among physicians and other healthcare providers, patients, third-party payors and, in the cancer market, acceptance by the operators of major cancer clinics.\nEven if our clinical drug candidates, or any other product candidate that we may develop or acquire in the future, obtains regulatory approval, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, third-party payors, patients and the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. The degree of market acceptance of any products for which we receive approval for commercial sale depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety of our products, as demonstrated in clinical trials, and the degree to which our products represent a clinically meaningful improvement in care as compared with other available therapies;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which our products are approved and any limiting contraindications, warnings, and precautions;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, operators of major cancer clinics and patients of our products as safe and effective treatments;\n\u00b7 the willingness of the target patient populations to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-parties and government authorities;\n\u00b7 the continued projected growth of oncology drug markets;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration, including access to drug administration equipment such as syringe pumps;\n\u00b7 the requirement for in-patient versus out-patient administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events and side effects; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIn addition, we must be able to successfully identify patient populations with sufficient numbers in order to successfully commercialize our products. There can be no guarantee that any of our programs will be effective at identifying target patient populations and the number of patients the markets in which may receive marketing approval (e.g., in the United States, Europe and elsewhere) may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, all of which would adversely affect the results of our operations and our business.\nIf we were to receive approval for any of our drug candidates and they failed to achieve market acceptance, we would not be able to generate significant revenue. In addition, there are no guarantees that any approved product will be effective, or gain market acceptance, if we were to obtain approval for additional indications.\nOur products or product candidates may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country and are subject to changes interpretation, application and new legislative proposals at any time. Some countries require the approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the income we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will cover and how much they will pay for them. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise the capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business may be affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in response to a lawsuit alleging that the individual mandate was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that the individual mandate and corresponding penalty was constitutional because it would be considered a tax by the federal government. The Supreme Court also upheld federal subsidies for purchasers of insurance through federally facilitated exchanges in a decision released in June 2015. Legislative proposals such as expanding the Medicaid drug rebate program to the Medicare Part D program, providing authority for the government to negotiate drug prices under the Medicare Part D program and lowering reimbursement for drugs covered under the Medicare Part B program have been raised in Congress but have been met with strong opposition and have not been enacted so far. The administration can rely on its existing statutory authority to make policy changes that could have an impact on the drug industry. For example, the Medicare program has in the past proposed to test alternative payment methodologies for drugs covered under the Part B program and finalized a proposal to pay hospitals less for Part B-covered drugs purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program effective January 1, 2018.\nModifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the ACA have been attempted in Congress as a result of the outcome of the recent presidential and congressional elections, consistent with statements made by the incoming administration and members of Congress during the presidential and congressional campaigns and following the election. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for the fiscal year of 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA.\nThe Budget Resolution is not a law. However, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In March 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for the fiscal year of 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the ACA. Attempts in the Senate in 2017 to pass similar ACA repeal legislation, including the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, were unsuccessful. However, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which includes a provision that effectively repeals the ACA\u2019s individual mandate by reducing the tax penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential coverage to zero. Following this legislation, Texas and 19 other states filed a lawsuit alleging that the ACA is unconstitutional as the individual mandate was repealed, undermining the legal basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decision. This lawsuit is ongoing. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), passed in February 2018, set government spending levels for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 and revised certain provisions of the ACA. Specifically, beginning in 2019, the BBA increased manufacturer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, ultimately increasing the liability for brand drug manufacturers. This mandatory manufacturer discount also applies to biosimilars beginning in 2019. Regardless of whether or not the ACA is changed or modified by Congress or the Supreme Court, we expect both government and private health plans to continue to require healthcare providers, including healthcare providers that may one day purchase our products, to contain costs and demonstrate the value of the therapies they provide.\nOur products or product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biological products may face competition sooner than expected.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the ACA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable.\u201d The FDA defines an interchangeable biosimilar as a product that (1) can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and (2), where the product is administered more than once, in terms of safety or diminished efficacy, presents no greater risk when switching between the biosimilar and its reference product than the risk of using the reference product alone. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years after, and approval by the FDA cannot be made effective until 12 years after, the date of the first licensure of the reference product. The law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted by the FDA and the courts. For example, in June 2017, the United States Supreme Court, in Sandoz, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., issued an opinion potentially impacting the previously understood effective market exclusivity period. The BPCIA\u2019s ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when this development and approval process may be fully adopted by the FDA, the manner in which FDA implements the process could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that ELZONRIS, or any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval by the FDA as a biological product under a BLA, should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. In addition, a competitor could decide to forego the biosimilar route and submit a full BLA after completing its own preclinical studies and clinical trials. In such cases, any exclusivity to which we may be eligible under the BPCIA would not prevent the competitor from marketing its product as soon as it is approved.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred net operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability, which would depress the market price of our common stock, and could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe have incurred net losses from operations from our inception through December 31, 2018 of approximately $300.8 million. We do not know whether or when we will become profitable. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in development and discovery activities. We anticipate that our operating losses will substantially increase over the next several years as we execute our plan to expand our discovery, research, development and commercialization activities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments including the cash proceeds received from our follow-on public offering during the first quarter of 2019, will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for at least the next two years. If our cash is insufficient to meet future operating requirements, we will have to raise additional funds. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all, we may be required to cease or reduce our operating activities or sell or license to third-parties some or all of our intellectual property. If we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. If we need to raise additional funds through the sale or license of our intellectual property, we may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us, if at all. In addition, if we do not continue to meet our diligence obligations under our license agreements for our clinical drug candidates that we have in-licensed, we will lose our rights to develop and commercialize those clinical drug candidates.\nIf we do not successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our existing and future product candidates and effectively manufacture, market and sell our product candidates that are approved, we may never generate sales of those product candidates, and even if we do generate sales, we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock also could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe will require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the discovery, acquisition and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We have expended and believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the development of our clinical drug candidates and may expend additional resources on other product candidates and drug discovery and acquisition efforts. These expenditures will include costs associated with general administration, facilities, research and development, acquiring new technologies, manufacturing product candidates, conducting preclinical experiments and clinical trials, applying for regulatory approvals, and commercializing any products that might receive approval for sale, as well as costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe do not expect to generate income until, and unless, we successfully commercialize one or more of our product compounds. As the outcome of our ongoing and future clinical trials is highly uncertain, our estimates of clinical trial costs necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates may differ significantly from our actual costs. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result of these and other factors currently unknown to us, we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, such as strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;\n\u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities for ELZONRIS, along with any of our other product candidates that may be approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u00b7 the cost associated with securing and establishing commercialization and manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates and any products for which we might receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 product sales of ELZONRIS;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the economic and other terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u00b7 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any;\n\u00b7 our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific, medical, sales, and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7 our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u00b7 delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other research and development activities for one or more of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 delay, limit, reduce or terminate manufacturing of our product candidates; or\n\u00b7 delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates that received or might receive regulatory approval and ensure their acceptance by third-party payors and the market.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to complete our clinical trials and achieve positive cash flow.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe will likely seek to raise additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholder rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third-parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nThere can be no assurance that deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by an economic downturn, a volatile business environment or an unpredictable and unstable market. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary equity, debt, or other financing more difficult to secure, more costly, more dilutive, and less favorable to existing shareholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon our business and clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. There is a possibility that our stock price may decline, due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn.\nAlthough we received FDA approval for ELZONRIS, and even if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, sales of our products depend on reimbursement by government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. If we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, reimbursement for our products, or coverage is reduced, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to sell our products on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we are required to sell our products at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount. Our products may be priced significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require some form of third party coverage to afford their cost. We anticipate that we will depend, to a significant extent, on governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. or country specific governmental organizations in foreign countries, and private third-party payers to defray the cost of our products to patients. These entities may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, including in the form of higher mandatory rebates or modified pricing terms.\nIn certain countries where we sell or are seeking or may seek to commercialize our products, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement or funding of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control. We may be unable to timely or successfully negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us, or such coverage, pricing, and reimbursement may differ in separate regions in the same country. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country, which may include a combination of distinct potential payers, including private insurance and governmental payers as well as health technology assessment of medicinal products for pricing and reimbursement methodologies. Therefore, we may not successfully conclude the necessary processes and commercialize our products in every, or even most countries in which we seek to sell our products.\nA significant reduction in the amount of reimbursement or pricing for our products in one or more countries may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. Certain countries establish pricing and reimbursement amounts by reference to the price of the same or similar products in other countries. Therefore, if coverage or the level of reimbursement is limited in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in current or new territories. In the U.S., the European Union member states, and elsewhere, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs. In the U.S. for example, the price of drugs has come under intense scrutiny by the U.S. Congress. Third party payers decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-payment levels. Government and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for healthcare products, examining the cost effectiveness of drugs in addition to their safety and efficacy, and limiting or attempting to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.\nHealth insurance programs may restrict coverage of some products by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by using utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or failure first on another type of treatment. Payers may especially impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs, and consequently, our products may be subject to payer-driven restrictions. Additionally, U.S. payers are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates.\nIn countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or other benefit limits may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing use of our potential products. We anticipate providing support for non-profit organizations that assist patients in accessing treatment for certain diseases. Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage imposes prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations. Such organizations\u2019 ability to provide assistance to patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all. We also may provide our products without charge to patients who have no insurance coverage for drugs through related charitable purposes. We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement at anticipated levels for our products. It may be difficult to project the impact of evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover our products. If we are unable to obtain or maintain coverage, or coverage is reduced in one or more countries, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with one FDA approved product, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n\u00b7 execute product candidate development activities;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 maintain, defend, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 build, deploy, and maintain sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with strategic partners, should our products obtain market approval;\n\u00b7 gain market and third-party payor acceptance for our products, should they obtain market approval;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain cGMP compliant manufacturing and distribution capabilities sufficient to support the intended scope of our preclinical and clinical development plans and the potential commercial demand for our product(s);\n\u00b7 complete required process characterization and validation activities to support any planned regulatory submission, which historically has included the manufacture of at least three (3) consecutive successful process validation batches for drug substance and at least three (3) consecutive successful process validation batches for drug product;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain any strategic relationships we elect to enter into;\n\u00b7 satisfy our obligations under our licensing agreement and other agreements; and\n\u00b7 manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to drug discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully, than we do.\nOur future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of product candidates. Our competitors may succeed in developing competing products before we do for the same indications we are pursuing, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining acceptance for products or for the same markets that we plan to target. If we are not \u201cfirst to market\u201d with our product candidates, our competitive position could be compromised because it may be more difficult for us to obtain marketing approval for that product candidate and successfully market that product candidate as a competitor.\nEven if we are \u201cfirst to market\u201d with one or more of our product candidates, a competitor could develop an alternative therapy for our approved indication(s) that demonstrates a superior efficacy and/or safety profile relative to our approved product(s).\nWe expect any product candidate that we are able to commercialize will compete with products from other companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. For example, there are a number of biopharmaceutical companies focused on developing therapeutics with which we may potentially compete including Astellas Pharma U.S., Inc., Bionomics Limited, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Geron Corp., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Macrogenics Inc., Micromet, Inc. (an Amgen, Inc. company), OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi U.S. LLC, Stemcentrx, Inc. (an AbbVie company), Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co. Ltd., Verastem, Inc., and others. Additionally, there are a number of companies working to develop new treatments, which may compete with ELZONRIS and SL-801, including AbbVie, Agios, Inc., Ambit Biosciences Corporation (now a Daiichi Sankyo company), Amgen, Astex Pharmaceuticals (now an Otsuka Pharmaceutical company), Celator Pharmaceuticals (now\na Jazz Pharmaceuticals company), Celgene Corporation, Cellectis, CTI BioPharma, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co. Ltd., Genmab, Genzyme Corporation (now a Sanofi company), Humanigen, Inc., Immunogen, Incyte Corporation, Impact Biomedicines (now a Celgene company), Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc., Kura Oncology, Inc., MustangBio, Inc., Novartis AG, Seattle Genetics, Inc., Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Xencor, among others. There are also a number of drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with SL-701, including, Avastin\u00ae (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel\u00ae (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.). There are a number of companies working to develop brain cancer therapeutics with programs in clinical testing, including Agenus Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Inc., Cortice Biosciences, Inc., CytRx Corporation, GenSpera, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG, and others.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many are farther along in their clinical development programs. We may not be able to compete unless we successfully:\n\u00b7 design and develop products that address an unmet medical need or demonstrate a superior benefit/risk profile to other products in the market;\n\u00b7 conduct successful preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 attract qualified scientific, medical, sales, marketing, and commercial personnel;\n\u00b7 obtain patent and/or other intellectual property protections for our processes and product candidates;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7 collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of new products.\nEstablished competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific and marketing personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management as well as other employees, consultants and scientific and medical collaborators. As of March 15, 2019, we had 92 full-time employees, which may make us more reliant on our individual employees than companies with a greater number of employees. Although none of these individuals has informed us to date that he or she intends to retire or resign in the near future, the loss of services of any of these individuals or one or more of our other members of senior management could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our ongoing and future clinical trials or the commercialization and successful marketing launch of our product candidates.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may also be engaged with companies other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nIf our employees or third parties acting on our behalf commit fraud or other misconduct, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, our business may experience serious adverse consequences.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees and third parties acting on our behalf. Misconduct by employees or third parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee and third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, penalties, other sanctions, and exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through the development process, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third-parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to identify, commence and manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, qualified suppliers, manufacturers and other third-parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative, sales, and marketing personnel. The hiring, training and integration of new employees may be more difficult, costly and/or time-consuming for us because we have fewer resources than a larger organization. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, or to accomplish them in a timely fashion, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIn connection with our commercial launch of ELZONRIS and international expansion, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, quality, commercial compliance, medical affairs, and sales and marketing. For example, we plan to hire additional personnel in connection with our commercial launch of ELZONRIS in the United States and Europe and preparation for potential regulatory filings for ELZONRIS in other markets. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with this anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing and commercial sale of our product candidates and and products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes or contributes to an injury or is found to be otherwise defective during product testing, clinical study, clinical use, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Fraud-based claims as well as claims made pursuant to state consumer protection acts are also a possibility. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to enroll future clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7 product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7 loss of income;\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 a decline in our stock price.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. Although we maintain liability insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government and also includes provisions allowing for private, civil whistleblower or \u201cqui tam\u201d actions;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA and HITECH also regulate the use and disclosure of identifiable health information by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of identifiable health information as well as requiring notification of regulatory breaches. HIPAA and HITECH violations may prompt civil and criminal enforcement actions as well as enforcement by state attorneys general;\n\u00b7 the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to U.S.-licensed physician and teaching hospital payments and other transfers of value including research payments and ownership and investment interests;\n\u00b7 analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and\n\u00b7 the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertain to our financial relationships and interactions with foreign government officials. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their employees, officers, and representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise seek favorable treatment. In many countries in which we operate or sell our products, the healthcare professionals with whom we interact may be deemed to be foreign government officials for purposes of the FCPA;\n\u00b7 the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and implementing laws in the EU member states govern the collection and processing of EU residents\u2019 personal data and, among other requirements, imposes certain consent and data access rights. Such laws may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials that involve EU personal data and engage in other activities that require the processing of EU personal data. Outside of the U.S. and the EU, there are numerous other jurisdictions that have their own privacy and information security laws, and new laws and regulations are being considered and/or enacted globally, which may affect our ability to collect, process, and store their residents\u2019 personal data; and\n\u00b7 analogous anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and healthcare laws and regulations in foreign countries.\nThe ACA broadened the reach of fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third-parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also release hazardous waste. We generally contract with third-parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk\nof release, contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of release, contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we and our suppliers may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party CMOs, CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product candidates\u2019 development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CMOs, CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, theft, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nEurope has enacted a new data privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, a violation of which could subject us to significant fines.\nIn May 2018, a new privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data, and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global turnover or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and the failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third-Parties\nThird-parties have conducted clinical trials of our product candidates in the past, and our ability to influence the design and conduct of such trials was limited. Our current and future corporate-sponsored trials will also require us to rely on various third-parties. Any failure by a third-party to meet its obligations with respect to the clinical and regulatory development of our product candidates may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products.\nWe are currently advancing our clinical-stage product candidates through multiple corporate-sponsored clinical trials under corporate-sponsored INDs and through investigator sponsored trials. Prior to sponsoring our INDs for our product candidates, faculty members at academic institutions and other companies may have conducted and sponsored the INDs and clinical trials relating to our drug candidates.As such, we did not control the design or conduct of any trials conducted prior to the initiation of our corporate-sponsored INDs, and it is possible that the FDA will not view these previous trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials or regulatory filings..\nIn addition, we have relied on contractual arrangements with academic institutions and investigators that provide us certain information rights with respect to the completed investigator-sponsored trials, including access to, and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the completed trials. If these obligations are breached by the investigators or institutions, or if the data prove to be inadequate, then our ability to conduct our planned corporate-sponsored clinical trials may be adversely affected. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the adequacy of the preclinical, manufacturing, and/or clinical data from these studies. If so, the FDA may require us to obtain and submit additional preclinical, manufacturing, and/or clinical data relating to our planned trials and/or may not accept such additional data as adequate for our regulatory filings.\nWe rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-parties to monitor, support, conduct and/or oversee clinical trials of our product candidates and, in some cases, to maintain regulatory files for our product candidates. If we are not able to maintain or secure agreements with such third-parties on acceptable terms to monitor, support, conduct and/or oversee these clinical trials, if these third-parties do not perform their services as required, or if these third-parties fail to timely transfer any regulatory information held by them to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates.\nTo conduct our preclinical and clinical studies, we rely on academic institutions, CROs, hospitals, clinics and other third-party collaborators who are outside our direct control, which limits our control over the overall conduct of these studies and the ability to successfully complete them. In our corporate-sponsored trials and investigator sponsored trials of ELZONRIS and our clinical drug candidates, we have continued to engage various third-parties. If we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with these third-parties on acceptable terms, or if any such engagement is terminated, we may be unable to enroll patients on a timely basis or otherwise conduct our trials in the manner\nwe anticipate. In addition, there is no guarantee that these third-parties will devote adequate time and resources to our studies or perform as required by contract or in accordance with regulatory requirements. If these third-parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to protocols or fail to act in accordance with regulatory requirements or our agreements with them, or if they otherwise perform in a substandard manner or in a way that compromises the quality or accuracy of their activities or the data they obtain, then trials of our product candidates may be extended, delayed, compromised or terminated, and as a result we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may seek to enter into strategic partnerships in the future, including alliances with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, to enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of our products in territories outside the United States. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any future product candidates and programs because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort, and/or third-parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product were disappointing.\nIf we ultimately determine that entering into strategic partnerships is in our best interest but either fail to enter into, are delayed in entering into, or fail to maintain such strategic partnerships:\n\u00b7 the development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7 our cash expenditures related to the development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7 we may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted;\n\u00b7 we will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates;\n\u00b7 the competitiveness of any product candidate that is commercialized could be reduced; and\n\u00b7 with respect to our platform technology, StemScreen\u00ae, we may not realize its potential as a means of identifying and validating new cancer therapies.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and supply our commercial products, clinical and preclinical product candidates. Any failure by a third-party manufacturer to produce supplies for us may delay or impair our ability to initiate or complete our clinical trials, commercialize our products or continue to sell any approved products.\nWe do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities, and we lack sufficient internal staff and infrastructure to produce clinical and preclinical product candidate supplies ourselves. As a result, we work with third-party CMOs to produce our products and clinical product candidates in acceptable quality and quantity for our ongoing and future clinical trials. If we are unable to maintain such third-party manufacturing sources, or fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, we may not be able to successfully produce, develop, and market ELZONRIS or our clinical drug candidates or may be delayed in doing so. We purchase and plan to purchase immunostimulants used with SL-701 from third-parties. Whereas GM-CSF and Imiquimod are commercially available products, poly-ICLC (Hiltonol\u00ae) is a development stage candidate and not commercially available. We do not have a right to manufacture poly-ICLC directly or through our third-party CMOs and are wholly dependent on a third-party manufacturer of poly-ICLC for clinical supply. This third-party manufacturer currently has a limited supply and may be unable to provide adequate poly-ICLC to us in the future.\nWe also expect to rely upon third-parties to produce drug substance and drug product required for the clinical trials and commercial supply of our products and product candidates. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, we may not be able to complete development of such other product candidates or market them, if eventually approved. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third-party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the\npossibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third-party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications), and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third-party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. We will be dependent on the ability of these third-party manufacturers to produce adequate supplies of drug product to support our clinical development programs and future commercialization of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to CGMP and similar standards for products manufactured for non-US markets. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with CGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product or product candidates of acceptable quality in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for trial initiation or marketing of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failures could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for products previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, which could result in or lead to recall, seizure, fines, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, injunctions, consent decrees, or civil or criminal sanctions.\nWe rely on our third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our products and product candidates for our clinical studies. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and materials that we use to manufacture and test our drugs. Such suppliers may not sell these materials to our third-party manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the material components thereof for a clinical trial, including an ongoing clinical trial, due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer, could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our third-party manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products or product candidates.\nWe are working with our third-party manufacturers to optimize the manufacturing processes for our products and product candidates, including related drug substances, so that these products and product candidates may be routinely produced in adequate quantities of adequate quality, and at an acceptable cost, to support our clinical trials and ultimate commercialization of any products that might be approved. Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to control batch-to-batch variability below an acceptable threshold, increasing the risk of batch failures, which could cause significant delays and increased costs to our programs. Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our products or product candidates at a cost, or in quantities, or in a timely manner necessary, to develop and commercialize them. If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we may be required to establish or access large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, assuming that our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third-parties with whom we currently work may need to increase their scale of production and/or we may need to secure additional suppliers.\nBecause of our reliance on contract manufacturers, we may choose to maintain a higher inventory of drug product and/or drug substance for any of our product candidates or approved products that would be necessary if we had direct control of the manufacturing assets.\nWe rely on a single third-party to manufacture and supply our drug substance and a single third-party to manufacture and supply our drug product for our products and product candidates. Any problems experienced by our third-party manufacturers or their vendors could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our products or product candidates to us until the third-party manufacturer or its vendor cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing and supply.\nThe third-party manufacturers of our products and product candidates require specialized equipment and utilize complicated production processes that would be difficult, time-consuming and costly to duplicate. Thus, we have multiple third-party manufacturers who supply our drug product candidates, one third-party manufacturer for each of our product candidates. Because of this arrangement, there is a greater risk that issues in execution or changes in business focus and/or product risk assessments at a third-party manufacturer could cause delays in the clinical development or manufacture of a product or product candidate than if we used more than one third-party manufacturer for each product or product candidate. For each of our products and product candidates, we currently rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from their third-party vendors the materials necessary to manufacture our products and product candidates for our clinical studies. Any prolonged disruption in a third-party manufacturer\u2019s vendor\u2019s ability to supply materials for our manufacturing could have a significant negative impact on our third-party manufacturer\u2019s their ability to manufacture our products or product candidates. This would cause us to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and timelines and, if applicable, any commercialization costs. In addition, our third-party manufacturers may experience problems not related to their vendors that could also have a significant negative impact on their ability\nto manufacture our products and product candidates on our own and would cause us to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and timelines, if applicable, and any commercialization costs. Moreover, third-party manufacturers and third-party laboratories performing analytical and other testing could receive inspection findings from regulatory authorities that require investigation and remediation, and this could result in business interruptions affecting the production of our product candidates. We may face losses related to the supply of drug substances, drug product, adjuvants and other components of the product due to third-party distribution and storage of such product. We may suffer losses due to third-party manufacturers\u2019 shortages or supply shortages of their vendors. We may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed coverage under our manufacturers\u2019 insurance policies. Events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, fire, sabotage or business accidents could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product candidate development and commercialization efforts until our third-party manufacturers can repair their facilities or we can qualify alternate third-party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines and that they can successfully transfer our manufacturing processes to produce product of equivalent quality and quantity. FDA approval of any new manufacturer would also be required. The delays associated with the qualification of a new manufacturer or the requalification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or produce approved products in a timely manner. Any delay or interruption in our clinical studies or in the development, validation and commercialization of our product candidates could negatively affect our business.\nTo the extent we elect to enter into licensing or collaboration agreements to develop and potentially commercialize our products or product candidates, our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business.\nOur global commercialization strategy for certain of our products or product candidates may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with collaborators to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of these products or product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs. We may determine that continuing to collaborate under the terms provided is not in our best interest, and we may terminate such collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements, and our products subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully commercialized.\nFurther, our future collaborators may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift, so that our programs receive less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators, on issues may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn income. In addition, we could have disputes with our future collaborators, on issues such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which might not be resolved in our favor.\nEven with respect to certain other products that we intend to commercialize ourselves, we may enter into agreements with collaborators to share in the burden of conducting clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing our product candidates or products. In addition, our ability to apply our proprietary technologies to develop proprietary compounds will depend on our ability to establish and maintain licensing arrangements or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such compounds. We may not be able to establish such arrangements on favorable terms or at all, and our future collaborative arrangements might not be successful.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe could be unsuccessful in obtaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our products or product candidates.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our products and product candidates or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire and the methods we use to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products or product candidates, and by the maintenance of our trade secrets through proper procedures. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them in the market they are being used or developed. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued, or that issued or allowed patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable. The patent prosecution process is expensive and\ntime-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. The patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of the U.S. have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection. Such subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the U.S. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in those licensed from a third-party.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to the United States patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern the administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-inventor-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others.\nThe costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nOur patents and patent applications may not be sufficient to protect our products and product candidates from commercial competition. For example, we cannot obtain a composition of matter patent and are limited in the types of claims that we can obtain for ELZONRIS due to earlier published prior art. We have however obtained U.S. and foreign patents for certain methods of using ELZONRIS to treat AML, BPDCN, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. In addition, we have filed additional U.S. and foreign patent applications for the method of using ELZONRIS to treat AML, MDS, BPDCN, and other diseases although there can be no assurances that such patents will issue.\nFailure to obtain patents directed to all approved uses of ELZONRIS may enable a competitor to market ELZONRIS for such approved but unpatented indication(s), which could lead to price erosion for sales of ELZONRIS. With respect to SL-701, although we have licensed an issued U.S. patent directed to the composition of matter for the mutant immunogenic IL-13R\u03b12 peptide, we currently do not have any foreign composition of matter patent protection. We do, however, have foreign pending patent applications, as well as an issued patents in Australia and Mexico and an allowed patent application in Europe, that would cover certain uses of this peptide. While we have a non-exclusive license to issued U.S. patents directed to methods of use for the EphA2 peptide, we currently do not have any composition of matter patent protection, although we do have rights to foreign pending patent applications that seek to cover certain uses of this peptide. While we have filed U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to methods of use of a new survivin mutant peptide for use in SL-701, we currently do not have any composition-of-matter patent protection. With respect to SL-801, we have licensed composition of matter patents issued in the U.S. and abroad directed to the SL-801 compound. While we have an issued patent in Canada and a patent application pending in the U.S. and Canada directed to our StemScreen\u00ae technology, we currently have no issued patents covering StemScreen\u00ae in the U.S. Although we have various patent applications pending in the U.S. and abroad that we anticipate may result in additional protection for ELZONRIS, our clinical drug candidates and StemScreen\u00ae, there can be no assurance that any of these applications will result in an issued patent, or that if they issue, they will provide additional meaningful protection for these assets. Our inability to obtain adequate patent protection for our product candidates or platform technology could adversely affect our business.\nIssued patents covering one or more of our products or product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of patentable subject matter, novelty, obviousness, written description or non-enablement.\nGrounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with the prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. Furthermore, any claims asserted against accused infringers could provoke those parties to petition the USPTO to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner and we were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or product candidates or certain aspects of our platform technology, StemScreen\u00ae. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, adverse results on U.S. patents may affect related patents in our global portfolio.\nThe issuance of a patent does not foreclose challenges to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Therefore, our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nClaims that our products or product candidates or StemScreen\u00ae, or the sale or use of our products or technology infringe the patent rights of third-parties could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve, even if litigation is avoided.\nWe cannot guarantee that our products or product candidates, the use of our products or product candidates, or our platform technology, StemScreen\u00ae, do not infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Third-parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets. Such third-parties might resort to litigation against us. The basis of such litigation could be existing patents or patents that issue in the future. Our failure to successfully defend against any claims that our product candidates or platform technology infringe the rights of third-parties could also adversely affect our business. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. For example, we are aware of third-party patents with certain claims directed to some of our product candidates, including one of the peptides used in SL-701 and structures which may be related to SL-1001. We may need to seek a license with respect to one or more of these third-party patents in order to commercialize our products. No assurance can be given that any such licenses will be available, or that they will be available on reasonable or commercially acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain any required licenses could restrict our ability to commercialize our products in certain territories or subject us to patent infringement litigation, could result in us having to cease commercialization of our products and/or subject us to money damages in such territories.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant patents or applications. Patent applications covering our products, product candidates, or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products, product candidates or the use of our products.\nIn order to avoid or settle potential claims with respect to any patent rights of third-parties, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third-party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on expected, reasonable, or acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or any future strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing one or more of our products or product candidates, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Patent litigation could also expose us to significant monetary damages. This could harm our business significantly.\nDefending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early-stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other Company business.\nUnfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could limit our research and development activities and/or our ability to commercialize certain products.\nIf third-parties successfully assert intellectual property rights against us, we might be barred from using certain aspects of our platform technology or barred from developing and commercializing certain products. Prohibitions against using certain technologies, or prohibitions against commercializing certain products, could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between a patent owner and us. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending against allegations of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets, we may be forced to pay substantial damage awards to the plaintiff. There is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation, including intellectual property litigation. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property litigation, even if the case against us is weak or flawed. If litigation leads to an outcome unfavorable to us, we may be required to obtain a license from the patent owner, in order to continue our research and development programs or to market our product(s). It is possible that the necessary licenses will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. This could limit our research and development activities, our ability to commercialize certain products, or both.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any future strategic partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDuring the course of any patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our product candidates, platform technology, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nELZONRIS, our clinical drug candidates, as well as some of our other product candidates and our platform technologies, are protected by intellectual property licensed from third parties, including academic institutions. If the licensors terminate the licenses, or fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and/or defend the licensed patents and patent applications, our competitive position, market share, and business prospects would be harmed.\nWe are a party to several license agreements relating to certain patents and patent applications owned by third-parties, upon which certain aspects of our business depend. In particular, we hold an exclusive license from Scott and White Memorial Hospital, or Scott and White, for ELZONRIS and SL-501, and we hold three licenses, including an exclusive license and two non-exclusive licenses, from the University of Pittsburgh relating to SL-701. Our license agreement with Scott and White survives, unless earlier terminated, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent or the date on which we owe no further payments to Scott and White. Our exclusive and our non-exclusive patent license agreements with the University of Pittsburgh survive, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent, and our non-exclusive license with the University of Pittsburgh to use and reference certain clinical trial data and information survives for a term of twenty years unless earlier terminated. We hold an exclusive license from CanBas, Ltd. for SL-801 in all worldwide territories other than Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. The agreement with CanBas, Ltd. survives until the later of ten years following the first commercial sale of each product in each country; the date upon which there are no more valid claims; or the expiration or termination of the last regulatory exclusivity period, after which our license becomes fully paid, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free. We also hold licenses from academic institutions relating to intellectual property underlying ELZONRIS and our product candidates and our StemScreen\u00ae platform technology. We expect to enter into additional license agreements as part of the development of our business.\nWe depend on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering ELZONRIS and our product candidates and we have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote on our behalf, or the priority they place on, maintaining patent rights and prosecuting patent applications to our advantage. Moreover, we have limited, if any, control over the strategies and arguments employed in the maintenance of patent rights and the prosecution of patent applications to our advantage. Our current or future licensors may not successfully prosecute certain patent applications under which we are licensed and on which our business depends. Even if patents issue from these applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may decide not to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement, or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability. Moreover, and possibly unbeknownst to us, our licensors may experience serious difficulties related to their overall business or financial stability, and they may be unwilling or unable to continue to expend the financial resources required to maintain and prosecute these patents and patent applications. While we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we depend, in part, on our licensors to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights and to inform us of the status of those protections and efforts thereto.\nOur licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the U.S. or other countries. Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement. We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on the defense of such third-party claims of infringement.\nIn addition, in spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and might therefore seek to terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to obtain regulatory approval and to market products covered by these license agreements. Our licensors may also seek to terminate the license agreements if we fail to satisfy our diligence obligations and/or meet specified milestones or upon insolvency. From time to time, we have had to request extensions of our development obligations contained in some of our license agreements, and we may need to seek further extensions in the future.\nAlthough we have obtained such extensions in the past, there can be no assurance that our licensors will continue to extend the development timelines or other milestones contained in our license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, we could lose our rights to develop and commercialize ELZONRIS and the product candidates governed by the licenses, and competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nWe could be unsuccessful in obtaining patent protection on one or more components of our platform technology.\nWe believe that an important factor in our competitive position relative to other companies in the field of targeted-oncology therapeutics is our proprietary innovative platform technology, StemScreen\u00ae. We believe that this platform is useful for identifying new potential product candidates. We have an issued Canadian patent and a pending U.S. patent application for StemScreen\u00ae, however, there is no guarantee that any of such pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and, even if patents eventually issue, there is no certainty that the issued claims will have adequate scope to preserve our competitive position. In addition, by practicing our technology in jurisdictions where we do not have patent protection, third-parties could substantially weaken our competitive position in oncology research and development.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third-parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, and proprietary information concerning our business strategy in order to protect our competitive position in the field of oncology. In the course of our research and development activities and our business activities, we often rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to vendors of laboratory or clinical development services or potential strategic partners. In addition, each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon joining our company. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, and our confidentiality agreements are carefully drafted to protect our proprietary interests. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures.\nTrade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or outside scientific collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors.\nEnforcing a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nOur research and development strategic partners may have rights to publish data and other information to which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research relevant to our business.\nThe ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to certain contractual limitations. These contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our confidential information. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication, or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7 others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7 we or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7 we or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7 it is possible that our applications for patent term extension for ELZONRIS pursuant to the Hatch Waxman Act will not result in added patent term, or may result in a shorter patent term extension than we applied for or that is available under the Hatch Waxman Act;\n\u00b7 the scope of our issued patents may not extend to competitive products developed or produced by others;\n\u00b7 issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7 our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights, or where the applicable laws provide a safe harbor exemption from infringement liability for certain research purposes, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7 the intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect ELZONRIS and our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharma industry involve both technological and legal complexities and is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, in recent years, Congress has passed patent-reform legislation providing new or revised limitations on attaining, maintaining and enforcing patent rights in the U.S. Further, the Supreme Court has issued several decisions in patent cases in recent years, which either narrow the scope of patent protection or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations.\nIn addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could hinder our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since our initial public offering which occurred in January 2013, the price of our common stock has ranged from $3.88 per share to $47.25 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies, in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 results from or delays of clinical trials of our products or product candidates, as well as results of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u00b7 our dependence on third-parties, including clinical research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, trial sites, clinical trial sponsors and clinical investigators;\n\u00b7 our ability to commercialize our approved product;\n\u00b7 the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 new products, product candidates or new uses for existing products or technologies introduced or announced by our competitors and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain the license agreements for our products or product candidates;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7 the level of expenses related to any of our products or product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 sales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems and product pricing restrictions;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders maintain the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially own shares representing approximately 19.4% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to exert substantial influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these\npersons, if they choose to act together, would exert substantial influence over the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7 establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7 allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u00b7 limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u00b7 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u00b7 limit who may call special stockholder meetings and the matters transacted at such meetings;\n\u00b7 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7 require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Any provision in our corporate charter or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock, will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 13761, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "STML"}
