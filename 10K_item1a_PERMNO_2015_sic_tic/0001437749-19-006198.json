{"cik": "1680873", "company": "HF Foods Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position or future financial performance.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nUnfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. may adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe operating results of the Company are substantially affected by the operating and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate. Economic conditions can affect us in the following ways:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in discretionary spending of consumers could adversely impact sales of Chinese/Asian restaurants, and their purchases from us. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending.\n\u25cf\nFood cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by consumers can lead to reductions in the frequency of and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases, which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products.\n\u25cf\nHeightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending, which can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers.\n\u25cf\nLiquidity issues and the inability of our customers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions involving the collection of funds from such customers.\n\u25cf\nLiquidity issues and the inability of suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to obtain the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested.\nIn addition, our existing operations are mainly located in the Southeastern United States. The geographic concentration of our operations creates an exposure to the economy of the Southeastern United States and any downturn in this region could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition may increase intensively in the future, which may adversely impact our margins and ability to retain customers, and make it difficult to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability.\nThe foodservice distribution industry in the United States is fragmented and highly competitive, with local, regional, multi-regional distributors, and specialty competitors. However, we believe that the market participants serving Chinese restaurants are highly fragmented. Currently, we face competition from smaller and/or dispersed competitors focusing on the niche market serving Chinese/Asian restaurants, especially Chinese takeout restaurants. However, with the growing demand for Chinese cuisines, others may also begin operating in this niche market in the future. Those potential competitors include: (i) national and regional foodservice distributors, (ii) local wholesalers and brokers, (iii) food retailers, and (iv) farmers\u2019 markets. The national and regional distributors are experienced in operating multiple distribution locations and expanding management, and they have greater marketing and financial resources than we do. Even though they currently offer only a limited selection of Chinese and Asian specialty foods, they may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products if they choose to do so. On the contrary, the local wholesalers and brokers are small in size with a deep understanding of local preferences, but their lack of scale results in high risk and limited growth potential.\nIf more competitors enter this market segment aiming to serve Chinese/Asian restaurants in the future, our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margins from competitive price changes, and/or greater operating costs, such as marketing costs, due to the increase of competition.\nWe may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs when the fuel price experiences highly volatility, and its operating results would be adversely affected.\nVolatile fuel prices have a direct impact on the industry served by us. We require significant quantities of fuel for delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel. The price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. The cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products, as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to the customers. Although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to its customers in the past, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. If fuel costs increase in the future, we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to its customers, which may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nDisruption of relationships with vendors could negatively affect our business. Suppliers may increase the product prices, which could increase product costs.\nWe purchase our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested. The cancellation of our supply arrangement with any of our suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability to supply the requested product from our suppliers could adversely affect our sales. If our suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, we purchase seasonal Chinese specialties of vegetables and fruits from farms and other vendors. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for its products. Input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we are unable to fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.\nThe purchasing prices of our products vary from time to time, which is subject to market conditions and negotiation with suppliers. The prices of some of our products, especially seasonal products, such as vegetables and fruits, have significant fluctuations. We can mitigate the risk of fluctuation in the purchasing and distribution costs by either fixing a price for a certain supply period through negotiation with its suppliers, streamlining its inventory turnover, and passing portions of the price fluctuation to its customers. However, we may not always be able to do that if there are significant and frequent fluctuations. If we are unable to mitigate these price fluctuations, our performance results will be adversely affected.\nAs a foodservice distributor, it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products that may have declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase the product from suppliers and the time we sell the product to customers, which could reduce the margin on that inventory, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur relationships with customers may be materially diminished or terminated. The loss of customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have maintained long-standing relationships with a number of our customers. However, those customers could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. Our customers may shift their purchase order from us to other competitors due to the market competition, change of customer requirements and preferences, or because of the customer\u2019s financial condition. There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of a number of customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe provide foodservice distribution to Chinese/Asian restaurants, primarily Chinese takeout restaurants, which focus on serving Chinese food to non-Chinese Americans. Changes in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward western foods) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, including attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs and/or supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to new eating preferences. Additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of food products, may be costly and time-consuming. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer culture preference, health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt its products offerings to trends in eating habits.\nWe may not be able to achieve the financial targets in the projections disclosed in our June 18, 2018 Proxy Statement.\nOur ability to meet the financial targets as disclosed in our June 18, 2018 Proxy Statement depends largely on our successful execution of business plan including various related initiatives. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in its anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan, and the timing of any related initiatives, are subject to change at any time based on management\u2019s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to successfully execute our business plan, whether due to the failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise, we may be unable to achieve these financial targets.\nWe may be unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property, which could result in customer confusion, a negative perception of its brand and adversely affect its business.\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks of Han Feng, Inc., are valuable assets that reinforce our customers\u2019 favorable perception of our products. Our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could cause customer confusion or negatively affect customers\u2019 perception of our brand and products, and eventually adversely affect our sales and profitability. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to renew or replace the current lease of our warehouse located in Georgia on favorable terms, or the current lease is terminated prior to expiration of its stated term, and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our operations and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nWe currently lease one of our warehouses for the distribution center located in Georgia. Our ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, its relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nFailure to retain our senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel. These executives, and in particular Zhou Min Ni, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chan Sin Wong, our President, have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand and culture, and the reputation the Company enjoys with suppliers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline. The loss of key employees could negatively affect our business.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate its business.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is labor intensive. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and customers. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the regions in which we are located, unemployment levels within those regions, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and enforcement of immigration laws could increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nFederal and state governments from time to time implement immigration laws, regulations or programs that regulate our ability to attract or retain qualified foreign employees. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we have implemented, and are in the process of enhancing, procedures to ensure our compliance with the employment eligibility verification requirements, there can be no assurance that these procedures are adequate and some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or civil or criminal penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. We may be required to terminate the employment of certain of our employees who were determined to be unauthorized workers. The termination of a significant number of employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. Our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nPotential labor disputes with employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nA considerable amount of our operating costs are attributable to labor costs and, therefore, our financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market. Rising health care costs and the nature and structure of work rules will be important issues. Any work stoppages or labor disturbances as a result of employees\u2019 dissatisfaction of their current employment terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also expect that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, we could incur additional costs and face increased competition.\nIf we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local governments, such as food safety and sanitation, ethical business practices, transportation, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, and human health and safety. While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot represent that it is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and prohibitions on exporting. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.\nIf the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness, or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.\nWe, like any other foodservice distributor, may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness, to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations. We may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. Any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation, and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness. We cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Further, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\nWith respect to product liability claims, we believe we have sufficient insurance coverage. However, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying products to us, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by such suppliers. If we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties or third-party claims for non-compliance.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:\n\u25cf\nthe discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and water;\n\u25cf\nthe management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes;\n\u25cf\nemployee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and\n\u25cf\nthe investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials.\nIn the course of operations, we operate, maintain, and fuel vehicles; store fuel in on-site above ground containers; operate refrigeration systems; and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food waste. We could incur substantial costs, including fines or penalties and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment. In addition, we could incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations carry an exposure to litigation risk from consumers, customers, our labor force and others, and may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of its business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in our businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.\nMany of our products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, sugar, and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have been increasing. While commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of our product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause our vendors to seek price increases from us. Although we are typically able to mitigate vendor efforts to increase our costs, we may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event we are unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, we may in turn consider raising our prices, and our customers may be deterred by any such price increases. Our profitability may be impacted through increased costs to us which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nThe U.S. government is currently imposing increased tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., including products imported from China, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nWe sell our products based on the cost of such products plus a percentage markup. We import approximately 20% of our products from other countries, including China. The U.S. government is currently imposing and proposing increased tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., including products imported from China. Some of our imported products may be subject to these increased tariffs and accordingly, our purchasing costs will be increased. We may determine to increase our sales prices in order to pass these increased costs to our customers. In the event we determine to take such action, our customers may reduce their orders from us, which could negatively affect our profitability and operating results.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where our distribution network covers or from which we obtain the products we sell may materially adversely affect our operations or our product offerings and, therefore, our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of our distribution centers, an insufficient work force in our market regions and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or a reduction in the availability of products in our offerings. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use technology in our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to make purchases, to manage warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. Further, our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners.\nThese technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, espionage, cyber-attacks, viruses, theft and inadvertent release of information. Any such disruption to these software and other technology systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage, any or all of which would potentially adversely affect Our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits.\nFurther, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technology, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we need to implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner. If our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do, such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur current indebtedness may adversely affect our liquidity position and ability of future financing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have $8.194 million of debt borrowed from a bank credit lines and $14.565 million of long-term mortgage loans, which could adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to raise additional capital or obtain financing in the future, react to changes in business and repay other debts. These bank loans contain covenants that restrict the ability of us to incur additional debt and operate our business. We may not be able to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on its debt facilities or refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness, due to the factors, including significant change of economic condition, market competition, whether conditions, outbreak of disaster, and failure of execution of its business plan.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Acquisition Strategy\nOur continued growth depends on future acquisitions of other distributors or wholesalers and enlarge its customer bases. The failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions, and our growth strategy depends, in large part, on acquiring other distributors or wholesalers to access the untapped market regions and enlarge our customer base. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on sufficient capital support from financing, finding suitable targets to acquire, identifying suitable locations and negotiating acceptable acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain sufficient capital support for the expansion plan, or successfully implement the plan to acquire other competitors timely or within budget or operate them successfully.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings may be materially adversely affected. A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. Significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially alter our debt-to-equity ratio, increase the interest expense and decrease net income, and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments.\nOur operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.\nThere is a scarcity of and competition for acquisition opportunities.\nThere are a limited number of operating companies available for acquisition that we deem to be desirable targets. In addition, there is a very high level of competition among companies seeking to acquire these operating companies. Many established and well-financed entities are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find to be desirable acquisition candidates. Many of these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us. Consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible acquisitions of these businesses. Even if we are able to successfully compete with these entities, this competition may affect the terms of completed transactions and, as a result, we may pay more or receive less favorable terms than we expected for potential acquisitions. We may not be able to identify operating companies that complement our strategy, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategy, we may be unable to complete an acquisition of such a company for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure to agree on the terms necessary for a transaction, such as the purchase price;\n\u25cf\nincompatibility between our operational strategies or management philosophies with those of the potential acquiree;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from other acquirers of operating companies;\n\u25cf\nlack of sufficient capital to acquire a profitable distribution company; and\n\u25cf\nunwillingness of a potential acquiree to work with our management.\nRisks related to acquisition financing.\nWe have a limited amount of financial resources and our ability to make additional acquisitions without securing additional financing from outside sources is limited. In order to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy, we may be required to obtain additional financing. We may obtain such financing through a combination of traditional debt financing or the placement of debt and equity securities. We may finance some portion of our future acquisitions by either issuing equity or by using shares of our common stock for all or a portion of the purchase price for such businesses. In the event that our common stock does not attain or maintain a sufficient market value, or potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the purchase price for the sale of their businesses, we may be required to use more of our cash resources, if available, in order to maintain our acquisition program. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, we will not be able to complete acquisitions and our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. The terms of our credit facility require that we obtain the consent of our lenders prior to securing additional debt financing. There could be circumstances in which our ability to obtain additional debt financing could be constrained if we are unable to secure such consent.\nTo the extent we make any material acquisitions, our earnings may adversely affected by non-cash charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration paid in a business combination to the identified acquired assets and liabilities based on their fair values at the time of acquisition. The excess of the consideration paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible assets acquired must be allocated among identifiable intangible assets including goodwill. The amount allocated to goodwill is not subject to amortization. However, it is tested at least annually for impairment. The amount allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and the like, is amortized over the life of these intangible assets. We expect that this will subject us to periodic charges against our earnings to the extent of the amortization incurred for that period. Because our business strategy focuses, in part, on growth through acquisitions, our future earnings may be subject to greater non-cash amortization charges than a company whose earnings are derived solely from organic growth. As a result, we may experience an increase in non-cash charges related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Our financial statements will show that our intangible assets are diminishing in value, even if the acquired businesses are increasing (or not diminishing) in value.\nWe are not obligated to follow any particular criteria or standards for identifying acquisition candidates.\nWe are not obligated to follow any particular operating, financial, geographic or other criteria in evaluating candidates for potential acquisitions or business combinations. We will determine the purchase price and other terms and conditions of acquisitions. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that our management team will use and consider in deciding whether or not to enter into a particular transaction.\nWe may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to successfully implement our acquisition strategy.\nSubject to the restrictions contained under our current credit facilities, we may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to complete future acquisitions. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of acquired businesses to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on the indebtedness, then we will be required to use our capital for such payments. This will restrict our ability to make additional acquisitions. We may also be forced to sell an acquired business in order to satisfy indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably once we incur this indebtedness or that we will be able to generate a sufficient amount of proceeds from the ultimate disposition of such acquired businesses to repay the indebtedness incurred to make these acquisitions.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel and assets of acquired businesses that may disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nA core component of our business plan is to acquire businesses and assets in the food distribution industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. Such acquisitions also involve numerous operational risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of entering new markets;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of existing or acquired strategic operating partners following an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees following an acquisition and the associated risk of competitive efforts from such departed personnel;\n\u25cf\npossible legal disputes with the acquired company following an acquisition; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nAs a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute any acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Common Stock\nA trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and our common stock prices could decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cHFFG\u201d, an active trading market for the shares of our common stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the following:\n\u25cf\nthe likelihood that an active trading market for shares of our common stock will be sustained;\n\u25cf\nthe liquidity of any such market;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock; or\n\u25cf\nthe price that our stockholders may obtain for their common stock.\nIn addition, our common stock has experienced price and volume volatility over the past year. The market price and volume of our common stock may continue to experience fluctuations not only due to general stock market conditions but also due to government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates, the condition of the U.S. economy and a change in sentiment in the market regarding our industry, operations or business prospects. In addition to other factors, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u25cf\nfactors influencing consumer food choices;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as tariffs, interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nsales of our equity securities by stockholders or managements or sales of additional equity securities by us;\n\u25cf\nactions by stockholders; and\n\u25cf\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry.\nIf an active market is not maintained, or if our common stock continues to experience price and volume volatility, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nStockholders of a public company sometimes bring securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration is impacted by the price of our common stock. A low stock price may adversely impact our ability to reduce our financial leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. Continued high levels of leverage or significant increases may adversely affect our credit ratings and make it more difficult for us to access additional capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans.\nZhou Min Ni beneficially owns approximately 31% of our outstanding common stock and has the ability to control our business and affairs, which may prevent us from taking actions that may be favorable to our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Zhou Min Ni, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, beneficially owned approximately 6,689,896 of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 31% of the voting power of our capital stock. As a result, Zhou Min Ni has the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that could be favorable to you.\nOur current management does not have corporate governance experience, and we may need to recruit expertise on corporate governance and capital markets to comply with the regulations and communicate with the capital markets, which may increase our operating expenses.\nOur current management doesn\u2019t have experience in running a public company and conducting corporate governance required of a public company. It may take time for our management team to learn to comply with the reporting, disclosure and corporate governance requirements and listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We may need to recruit expertise on corporate governance and capital markets to comply with applicable regulations and communicate with the capital markets, which may increase our operating expenses.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports, affect the ability of our auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls should we become an accelerated filer in the future, and weaken investor confidence in our financial reporting.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that (i) our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2018, (ii) there existed a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, and (iii) our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018. Please see the discussion of these conclusions below under Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe we are taking appropriate actions to remediate such material weakness and inadequate disclosure controls and procedures; however, such measures may not be sufficient to address the material weaknesses identified or ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. We may also discover other material weaknesses in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in the implementation of such controls, could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements and affect the ability of our auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financing reporting to the extent we become an accelerated filer in the future. In addition, substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are not required to obtain an attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting from an independent registered public accounting firm, which may cause investors to lose confidence in us and cause the price of our common stock to be negatively impacted.\nUnder rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are not required to obtain from our independent registered public accounting firm an attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, and we have not voluntarily sought such a report in the past. If we do not voluntarily seek to obtain an unqualified attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm in the future, or if we seek to obtain such a report but our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide one to us, investors may lose confidence in us and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of any June 30 or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a rolling three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies.\nOn January 11, 2019, we received written notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements due to our failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOn January 11, 2019, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that we no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G) due to our failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the \u201cAnnual Meeting Requirement\u201d).\nNasdaq\u2019s notice has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), we had 45 calendar days from January 11, 2019 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, or until July 1, 2019, to regain compliance. On February 21, 2019, we provided Nasdaq with a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement, which, among other things, explained the reasons for not holding our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and stated our intention to hold an annual meeting of stockholders on or before July 1, 2019. As of the date of this report, we have not received a response to our compliance plan from Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of March 27, 2019, there were 22,167,486 shares of our common stock outstanding. Of this number, 2,137,653 shares of common stock were freely tradable without restriction, unless the shares are purchased by our affiliates. The remaining 20,029,833 shares of common stock were \u201crestricted securities\u201d as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. None of our directors, executive officers or employees are subject to lock-up agreements or market stand-off provisions that limit their ability to sell shares of our common stock. The sale of a large number of shares of our common stock, or the belief that such sales may occur, could cause a drop in the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business or our market. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to do so in the near term. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock in the near term, and capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 16922, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "HFFG"}
