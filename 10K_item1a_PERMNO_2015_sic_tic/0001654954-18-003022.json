{"cik": "1719406", "company": "Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this 2017 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results.\nWe have no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe have no operating results to date. Therefore, our ability to commence operations is dependent upon obtaining financing through the public offering of our securities. Since we do not have an operating history, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to consummate an initial business combination. We have not conducted any substantive discussions and we have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective acquisition candidates. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\nIf we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait more than 12 months (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) before receiving distributions from the trust account.\nWe have 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of t the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) in which to complete a business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless (i) we consummate a business combination prior thereto or (ii) we seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummation of a business combination, and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert or sell their shares to us. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public security holders be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination.\nWe will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Report. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination instead of conducting a tender offer.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units are intended to be used to complete a business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we are deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, since we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 as a result of the Initial Public Offering, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete a business combination within 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our units are immediately tradable, we are entitled to withdraw amounts from the funds held in the trust account prior to the completion of a business combination and we have a longer period of time to complete such a business combination than we would if we were subject to such rule.\nIf we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this Report would be rendered irrelevant and you would be investing in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines disclosed in this Report although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, we currently anticipate acquiring a target business with a consistent historical financial performance. However, we are not obligated to do so and may determine to merge with or acquire a company with no operating history if the terms of the transaction are determined by us to be favorable to our public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Report would be rendered irrelevant. We could also seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to provide us with more time to complete an initial business combination. Accordingly, investors may be making an investment in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of March 21, 2018, there are 85,701,000 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of the underwriter\u2019s option, conversion of outstanding rights (including private placement rights and the rights underlying the underwriter's option) and warrants (including the warrants contained in the private placement units and the underwriter\u2019s option). As of March 21, 2018, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Although we have no commitment as of the date of this 2017 Form 10-K, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock will not reduce the per-share conversion amount in the trust account. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf\nmay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in the Initial Public Offering;\n\u25cf\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:\n\u25cf\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n\u25cf\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.\nIf we incur indebtedness, our lenders will not have a claim on the cash in the trust account and such indebtedness will not decrease the per-share conversion amount in the trust account.\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units not being held in trust are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), we may be unable to complete a business combination.\nWe believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate. Accordingly, if we use all of the funds held outside of the trust account, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, officers or directors or their affiliates to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount that they deem reasonable in their sole discretion for our working capital needs. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder\u2019s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into private units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well as 75,000 warrants to purchase 75,000 shares).\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete a business combination and distribute the proceeds held in trust to our public stockholders, A/Z Property has agreed (subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in this Report) that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We believe A/Z Property has sufficient net worth to satisfy its indemnity obligation should it arise, however we cannot assure you that A/Z Property will have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by A/Z Property specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the trust account may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will continue in existence only until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). If we have not completed a business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce A/Z Property's indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and A/Z Property asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against A/Z Property to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against A/Z Property to enforce such indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nNo warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold and may be subject to redemption.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under the Warrant Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants (including the warrants contained in the private placement units) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we would need only 1,656,876, or 48.0%, of the public warrants to vote in favor of a proposed amendment for it to be approved (assuming the holders of the warrants contained in the private placement units all voted in favor of the amendment).\nWe may amend the terms of the rights in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding rights.\nOur rights were issued in registered form under a right agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent, and us. The right agreement provides that the terms of the rights may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The right agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding rights in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we would need only 3,313,751, or 48.0%, of the public rights to vote in favor of a proposed amendment for it to be approved (assuming the holders of the private rights all voted in favor of the amendment).\nSince we have not yet selected a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.\nAlthough we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry, we are not limited to such industry and may consummate a business combination with a company in any industry we choose. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following a business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. In addition, none of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, our officers may have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nAdditionally, the role of our key personnel after a business combination cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may continue to serve in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire.\nAlthough we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry, which is where our management team has significant experience, we are not limited to such industry and may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding a business combination.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other appropriate arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nOur officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.\nOur sponsor, which is affiliated with certain of our officers and directors, has agreed to waive its right to convert its founder\u2019s shares and any other shares purchased in the Initial Public Offering or thereafter, or to receive distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder\u2019s shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the shares acquired prior to the Initial Public Offering will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. Additionally, the warrants, including the warrants contained in the private placement units held by our sponsor, will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers, through their interests in our sponsor, may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nCertain of our officers have, and any of our officers and directors or their affiliates may in the future have, outside fiduciary and contractual obligations and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nCertain of our directors have, and any of our officers and directors or their affiliates may in the future have, fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with the consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business. For a more detailed description of the pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations of our management team, and the potential conflicts of interest that such obligations may present, see the section Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nWe cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future prior to an initial business combination. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is likely that Nasdaq will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because we expect that our units and eventually our common stock, rights and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq, our units, common stock, rights and warrants will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1.07 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.\nIt is likely we will consummate a business combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously acquire several target businesses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\n\u25cf\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses, and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combinations. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies into a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nThe ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights or sell their shares to us in a tender offer may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many stockholders may exercise conversion rights or seek to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us.\nIn connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of a proposed business combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\nIn connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsor, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Report) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination. This ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of our proposed business combination may make it more likely that we will consummate a business combination.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we convert his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. We may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders\u2019 option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nIf, in connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed business combination, we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System as described above and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval or engaging in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination may delay the consummation of such a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding warrants, rights and the unit purchase option, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units will be sufficient to allow us to consummate a business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units prove to be insufficient, because of either the size of the business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares from dissenting stockholders, we will be required to seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\nOur initial stockholder controls a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nAs of March 21, 2018, our initial stockholder owns approximately 22.1% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase any units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote or magnitude of the number of stockholders seeking to tender their shares to us. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our sponsor and initial stockholder, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before the Initial Public Offering as well as any shares of common stock acquired in the Initial Public Offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nOur board of directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There may not be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholder, because of its ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholder will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\nOur outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nWe issued rights to receive 690,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 3,450,000 shares of common stock as part of the units offered in connection with the Initial Public Offering and rights to receive 27,250 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 136,250 shares of common stock in connection with the Private Placement. We also issued unit purchase options to purchase 600,000 units to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (and/or its designees) which, if exercised, will result in the issuance of 600,000 shares of common stock, rights to receive 60,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 300,000 shares of common stock. We may also issue additional private units, which will be identical to the private placement units, to our sponsor, officers or directors in payment of working capital loans made to us as described in this 2017 Form 10-K. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon conversion or exercise of these rights, warrants and unit purchase options could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our rights, warrants and unit purchase option may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants, rights, or unit purchase option could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these rights are converted or warrants and options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nBecause each unit contains one-half of one warrant and one right to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach unit contains one-half of one warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants and rights upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable for, and the rights will be convertible into, a fraction of the number of shares in the aggregate, compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the warrants contained in the private placement units will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this 2017 Form 10-K have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrant (including any warrants held by our sponsor, officers or directors or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nWe have no obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants.\nIn no event will we have any obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants. Furthermore, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights or warrants upon consummation of an initial business combination or exercise of the warrants. Accordingly, you might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights and warrants.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nOur stockholders prior to the Initial Public Offering are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the founder\u2019s shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the holders of the private placement units and any private units our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the private placement units and any other private units we issue to them (and the underlying securities) commencing at any time after we consummate an initial business combination. The presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf\nregistration as an investment company;\n\u25cf\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nIf we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business, we may subsequently be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nWe must conduct a due diligence investigation of the target businesses we intend to acquire. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular target business, and factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control may later arise. If our diligence fails to identify issues specific to a target business, industry or the environment in which the target business operates, we may later be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing during or subsequent to the business combination.\nOur sponsor may decide not to extend the term we have to consummate our initial business combination, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, and the rights and warrants will be worthless.\nWe will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Investment Management Trust Account Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and us, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension (or up to an aggregate of $1,380,000), or $0.20 per share, if we extend for the full six months). Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial stockholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loans out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete a business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the rights and warrants will be worthless.\nThe requirement that we complete an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination.\nWe have 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) to complete an initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nResources could be spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nIt is anticipated that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate the business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require that we have such system of internal controls audited beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal controls, which requirement we are exempt from so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nWe may effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business\u2019s home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\u25cf\nrules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf\ncultural and language differences;\n\u25cf\nemployment regulations;\n\u25cf\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u25cf\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Also, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, which may inhibit a takeover of us.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, we will not be able to complete a business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with such standards.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with any tender offer documents we use, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. Additionally, to the extent we furnish our stockholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial statements may need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere may be tax consequences to our business combinations that may adversely affect us.\nWhile we expect to undertake any merger or acquisition so as to minimize taxes both to the acquired business and/or asset and us, such business combination might not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization, or the parties might not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of shares or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of substantial taxes.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we consummate a business combination with a target business in the senior housing and care industry, we would be subject to the risks attendant to that industry.\nIf we are successful in consummating a business combination with a target business in the senior housing and care industry, we would be subject to all of the risks attendant to that industry, including, among others:\n\u25cf\nterminations of short-term resident agreements and resident attrition;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial reliance on private pay residents;\n\u25cf\nrisks and circumstances that adversely affect the ability of the elderly to pay for our services;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from a significant number of competitors, some of which may have substantially greater financial resources than we have;\n\u25cf\ninherent risk of liability in the provision of personal and health care services, not all of which may be covered by insurance; and\n\u25cf\nsignificant government regulations and compliance, some of which is burdensome and some of which may change to our detriment in the future.", "PERMNO": 17134, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "BRPA"}
