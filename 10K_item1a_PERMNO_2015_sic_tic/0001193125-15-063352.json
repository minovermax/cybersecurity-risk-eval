{"cik": "1059556", "company": "MOODYS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company\u2019s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nU.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry are Rapidly Evolving and May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business\nMoody\u2019s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. See \u201cRegulation\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information. These laws and regulations:\n\u00bb\nseek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among rating agencies and in the credit rating business;\n\u00bb\nmay result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;\n\u00bb\nrestrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;\n\u00bb\nincrease regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;\n\u00bb\nprovide for direct jurisdiction of the SEC over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and\n\u00bb\nauthorize the adoption of enhanced oversight standards and new pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.\nThese laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which Moody\u2019s may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody\u2019s business and its customers\u2019 businesses, and they may affect MIS\u2019s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS\u2019s ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS\u2019s ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for rating agencies. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may affect Moody\u2019s stock price. Although these recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to rating agencies and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody\u2019s in a disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\nFinancial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit Rating Industry May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the EU, and introduced a common EU regulatory approach to oversight of CRAs. The EU has established conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules on the organization and conduct of CRAs-including restrictions on certain activities deemed to create a conflict of interest-and special requirements for the rating of structured finance instruments. ESMA has direct supervisory authority for CRAs in the EU.\nMIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection. Applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed, and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.\nOn January 6, 2015, two additional rules (generally referred to as \u201cRegulatory Technical Standards\u201d or \u201cRTSs\u201d) of direct relevance to the CRA industry were published in the Official Journal of the European Union: (i) CRAs\u2019 reporting requirements to ESMA on their fees; and\nMOODY\u2019S 2014 10K\n(ii) the types of information that CRAs are to provide about certain ratings (those that were paid for by issuers) for publication on a central website administered by ESMA (the European Ratings Platform). Separately, CRA3 also requires that ESMA and / or the European Commission produce several reports on the industry\u2019s structure and the use of ratings. These reports are expected to be published by year end 2015.\nEU financial reforms could have a significant negative effect on Moody\u2019s operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that Moody\u2019s presently is unable to predict. In particular, exposure to increased liability under the EU regulations may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact Moody\u2019s results of operations. In addition, compliance with the amended EU regulations may increase costs of operations.\nFurther, Moody\u2019s believes there is still potential for additional rulemaking by the EU and other jurisdictions that can significantly impact operations or the markets for Moody\u2019s products and services, such as regulations affecting the need for debt securities to be rated, establishing criteria for credit ratings or limiting the entities authorized to provide credit ratings. Moody\u2019s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on Moody\u2019s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. Financial reforms in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Faces Exposure to Litigation Related to Rating Opinions and Other Business Practices\nMoody\u2019s faces exposure to litigation related to MIS\u2019s ratings actions, as well as other business practices. As a result of difficult economic times and turbulent markets in recent years, the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased. This development has led to a significant increase in the number of legal proceedings that Moody\u2019s is facing, including class actions and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues. Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody\u2019s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, to the extent that Moody\u2019s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody\u2019s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody\u2019s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions\nMoody\u2019s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates may have an impact on the Company\u2019s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere could affect the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition, operations abroad expose Moody\u2019s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:\n\u00bb\nrestrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD;\n\u00bb\nexposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;\n\u00bb\nthe costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;\n\u00bb\nU.S. laws affecting overseas operations including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u00bb\ndiffering legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards;\n\u00bb\ncurrent and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;\n\u00bb\nuncertain and evolving laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries;\n\u00bb\neconomic, political and geopolitical market conditions;\n\u00bb\nthe possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;\n\u00bb\ncompetition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;\nMOODY\u2019S 2014 10K\n\u00bb\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00bb\nlonger payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;\n\u00bb\ndiffering accounting principles and standards;\n\u00bb\ndifficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages; and\n\u00bb\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nAdditionally, Moody\u2019s is subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company\u2019s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s Operations and Infrastructure May Malfunction or Fail\nMoody\u2019s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody\u2019s is located, including New York City, the location of Moody\u2019s headquarters, major cities worldwide in which Moody\u2019s has offices, and locations in China used for data and development work. This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure, including the Company\u2019s electronic delivery systems, data center facilities and the Internet, used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody\u2019s conducts business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Moody\u2019s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers to provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company\u2019s third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet the Company\u2019s needs and the needs of the Company\u2019s customers, the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs. The Company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody\u2019s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons\u2019 ability to service and interact with Moody\u2019s clients and customers may suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company\u2019s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to Moody\u2019s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its clients in the Company\u2019s computer systems and networks and those of its third party vendors. The cyber risks the Company\u2019s faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of Moody\u2019s or Moody\u2019s vendors\u2019 technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s or such vendors\u2019 web sites, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody\u2019s business or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that Moody\u2019s takes to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become obsolete. Any material breaches of cybersecurity could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business\nMoody\u2019s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities may elect to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional\nMOODY\u2019S 2014 10K\nparties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A majority of Moody\u2019s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Accordingly, any market volatility or conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or issuers\u2019 willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody\u2019s provides ratings services and thereby have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to the amount of revenues that may be derived from Moody\u2019s ratings services.\nCredit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Economic and government factors such as a long-term continuation of difficult economic conditions and a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. Future debt issuances could be negatively affected by a sharp increase in long-term interest rates or factors which cause instability or volatility in the global capital markets, such as significant regulatory, political or economic events, the use of alternative sources of credit, including financial institutions and government sources, and defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors. Changes in the markets for such securities and in the role and regulation of rating agencies may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nMoody\u2019s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient and cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company\u2019s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those undertaken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Volatility in the financial markets, including changes in the volumes of debt securities and changes in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers\nThere is price competition in the credit rating, research, credit risk management markets, outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services. Competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, the current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and result in reductions in the size of the Company\u2019s customer base. Tepid economic growth is also intensifying the competitive pressures as to pricing. While Moody\u2019s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it may lose market share if its pricing is not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive pressures. Any inability of Moody\u2019s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns\nMoody\u2019s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody\u2019s, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody\u2019s business could be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process and its implementation with respect to one or more securities. Operational errors, whether by Moody\u2019s or a Moody\u2019s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies May Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company\u2019s Business\nThe markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in client demands and evolving industry standards. The ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers\u2019 changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody\u2019s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody\u2019s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers; these indirect competitors could choose to\nMOODY\u2019S 2014 10K\ncompete directly with us in the future. In addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody\u2019s products and services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive Internet information may reduce the demand for Moody\u2019s products and services. Moody\u2019s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody\u2019s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Has a Significant Amount of Intangible Assets\nAt December 31, 2014, Moody\u2019s had $1,021.1 million of goodwill and $345.5 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 71% of these intangibles reside in the MA business and are allocated to the four reporting units within MA: RD&A; ERS; Financial Services Training and Certifications; and Copal Amba. The remaining 29% of these intangibles reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in an asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nPossible Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures May Negatively Impact the Company\nMoody\u2019s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody\u2019s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody\u2019s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody\u2019s. Moody\u2019s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. There is a risk that even if the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed.\nMoody\u2019s is highly dependent on the continued services of Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody\u2019s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody\u2019s Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions May Not Produce Anticipated Results\nMoody\u2019s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen its business and grow the Company. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks. The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect Moody\u2019s ability to complete such transactions. If Moody\u2019s is unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, its business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; diverting management\u2019s focus from other business operations; and failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies. The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on Moody\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Trading Price of Moody\u2019s Stock Could be Affected by Third Party Actions\nOwnership of Moody\u2019s stock is highly concentrated with a significant portion of shares held by a few institutional stockholders. Due to this concentrated stockholder base, the trading price of Moody\u2019s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant\nMOODY\u2019S 2014 10K\nstockholders to increase or decrease their positions in Moody\u2019s stock. As a result, the actions of these institutional stockholders could create high stock volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s Compliance and Risk Management Programs Might Not be Effective and May Result in Outcomes That Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Reputation, Financial Condition and Operating Results.\nMoody\u2019s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply with numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems. Moody\u2019s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company\u2019s risks may not be fully effective, and Moody\u2019s employees [or agents] may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If Moody\u2019s employees violate its policies or if the Company\u2019s risk management methods are not effective, the Company could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nLegal Protections for the Company\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights may not be Sufficient or Available to Protect the Company\u2019s Competitive Advantages.\nMoody\u2019s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. On January 6, 2015, a rule with direct relevance to the CRA industry was published in the Official Journal of the European Union regarding the types of information that CRAs are to provide about certain ratings (those that were paid for by issuers) for publication on a central website administered by ESMA (the European Ratings Platform). This rule directly relates to the Company\u2019s intellectual property as it would require that the Company provide proprietary information at no cost that the Company currently sells, which could result in lost revenue.\nAdditionally, despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. Even if Moody\u2019s attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful.\nThe Company is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, and Network Infrastructure (Together, \u201cThird Party Technology\u201d), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.\nMoody\u2019s relies on Third Party Technology in connection with its product development and offerings. The Company depends on the ability of Third Party Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third Party Technology Moody\u2019s uses may become obsolete, incompatible with future versions of the Company\u2019s products, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and Moody\u2019s business could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to timely or effectively replace such Third Party Technology. The Company also monitors its use of Third Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company cannot assure that such third parties will permit Moody\u2019s use in the future, resulting in increased Third Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for Third Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Third Party Technology are substantial. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody\u2019s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 48506, "SIC": 7323, "TIC": "MCO"}
