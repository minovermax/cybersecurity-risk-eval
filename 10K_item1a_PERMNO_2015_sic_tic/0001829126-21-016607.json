RISK FACTORS\nRisks\nRelating to Our Business and Financial Condition\nWe\ncurrently have no operations, and investors, therefore, have no basis on which to evaluate the Company\u2019s future prospects.\nWe\ncurrently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business to commence operations and\ngenerate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability\nto achieve our business objective of locating and completing a business combination with a target business. We have no current arrangements\nor understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete a business combination\nin a reasonable timeframe, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to complete a business combination as planned, we will never generate\nany operating revenues.\nWe\nmay face difficulties or delays in our search for a business combination, and we may not have access to sufficient capital to consummate\na business combination.\nWe\nmay face difficulty identifying a viable business opportunity or negotiating or paying for any resulting business combination. Economic\nfactors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic downturn, as well as increased competition\nfor acquisitions of operating entities that we expect to encounter as a result thereof, may hinder our efforts to locate and/or obtain\na business that is suitable for our business goals at a price we can afford and on terms that will enable us to sufficiently grow our\nbusiness to generate value to our shareholders. We have limited capital, and we may not be able to take advantage of any available business\nopportunities on favorable terms or at all due to the limited availability of capital. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient\ncapital to provide us with the necessary funds to successfully develop and implement our plan of operation or acquire a business we deem\nto be appropriate or necessary to accomplish our objectives, in which case we may be forced to terminate our business plan and your investment\nin the Company could become worthless.\nIf\nwe are not successful in acquiring a new business and generating material revenues, investors will likely lose their investment.\nIf\nwe are not successful in developing a viable business plan and acquiring a new business through which to implement it, our investors\u2019\nentire investment in the Company could become worthless. Even if we are successful in combining with or acquiring the assets of an operating\nentity, we can provide no assurances that the Company will be able to generate significant revenue therefrom in the short-term or at\nall or that investors will derive a profit from their investment. If we are not successful, our investors will likely lose their entire\ninvestment.\nIf\nwe cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable.\nBusinesses,\nincluding development-stage companies such as ours and/or any operating business or businesses we may acquire, often grow rapidly and\ntend to have difficulty managing their growth. If we are able to acquire an operating business, we will likely need to expand our management\nteam and other key personnel by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees and/or consultants capable of providing\nthe necessary support.\nWe\ncannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges\ncould cause us to lose money, and your investment could be lost.\nBecause\nwe have limited capital, we may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which\nmay dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights.\nWe\nmay require additional capital to acquire a business. We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. Future business\ndevelopment activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses,\nand accounting expenses, will require a substantial amount of additional capital. The terms of securities we issue in future capital\nraising transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include liquidation preferences, superior voting rights, or the issuance\nof other derivative securities, which could have a further dilutive effect on or subordinate the rights of our current investors. Any\nadditional capital raised through the sale of equity securities will likely dilute the ownership percentage of our shareholders. Additionally,\nany debt securities we issue would likely create a liquidation preference superior to that of our current investors and, if convertible\ninto shares of Common Stock, would also pose the risk of dilution.\nWe\nmay be unable to obtain necessary financing if and when required.\nOur\nability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both in general and in the\nparticular industry or industries in which we may choose to operate), our limited operating history, and current lack of operations,\nthe national and global economies, and the condition of the market for microcap securities. Further, economic downturns such as the current\nglobal depression caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists\nfor an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding\nwe require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from\nfuture operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to discontinue our development or implementation\nof a business plan, cancel our search for business opportunities, cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain\nfinancing on unattractive terms. If any of the foregoing should happen, our shareholders could lose some or all of their investment.\nBecause\nwe are still developing our business plan, we do not have any agreement for a business combination.\nWe\nhave no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a business combination with any specific entity.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and evaluating a suitable acquisition candidate or in consummating a business combination. We\nare neutral as to what industry or segment for any target company. We have not established specific metrics and criteria we will look\nfor in a target company, and if and when we do we may face difficulty reaching a mutual agreement with any such entity, including in\nlight of market trends and forces beyond our control. Given our early-stage status, there is considerable uncertainty and therefore inherent\nrisk to investors that we will not succeed in developing and implementing a viable business plan.\nThe\nCOVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition, future plans and results of operations.\nThis\nCOVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on the economy in the United States and on most businesses. The Company is not\nable to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the pandemic and government action in response\nthereto impose limitations on our operations or result in a prolonged economic recession or depression, the Company\u2019s development\nand implementation of its business plan and our ability to commence and grow our operations, as well as our ability to generate material\nrevenue therefrom, will be hindered, which would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results\nof operations.\nBecause\nwe are dependent upon Issamar Ginzberg, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director to manage and oversee our Company, the loss of\nhim could adversely affect our plan and results of operations.\nWe\ncurrently have a sole director and officer, Issamar Ginzberg, who manages the Company and is presently evaluating a viable plan for our\nfuture operations. We will rely solely on his judgment in connection with selecting a target company and the terms and structure of any\nresulting business combination. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position. Further, because Mr. Ginzberg serves\nas Chief Executive Officer and sole director and also holds a controlling interest in the Company\u2019s Common Stock, our other shareholders\nwill have limited ability to influence the Company\u2019s direction or management.\nIn\naddition, although not likely, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of a combination with\ntheir business. The departure of a target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and prospects of our post-combination\nbusiness. The role of a target\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of the transaction cannot be ascertained at this time. Although\nwe contemplate that certain or all members of a target\u2019s management team may remain associated with the target following a change\nof control thereof, there can be no assurance that all of such target\u2019s management team will decide to remain in place. The loss\nof key personnel, either before or after a business combination and including management of either us or a combined entity could negatively\nimpact the operations and profitability of our business.\nRisks\nRelated to a Potential Business Acquisition\nWe\nmay encounter difficulty locating and consummating a business combination, including as a result of the competitive disadvantages we\nhave.\nWe\nexpect to face intense competition in our search for a revenue-producing business to combine with or acquire. Given the current economic\nclimate, venture capital firms, larger companies, blank check companies such as special purpose acquisition companies and other investors\nare purchasing operating entities or the assets thereof in high volumes and at relatively discounted prices. These parties may have greater\ncapital or human resources than we do and/or more experience in a particular industry within which we choose to search. Most of these\ncompetitors have a certain amount of liquid cash available to take advantage of favorable market conditions for prospective business\npurchaser such as those caused by the recent pandemic. Any delay or inability to locate, negotiate and enter into a business combination\nas a result of the relative illiquidity of our current asset or other disadvantages we have relative to our competitors could cause us\nto lose valuable business opportunities to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe\nmay expend significant time and capital on a prospective business combination that is not ultimately consummated.\nThe\ninvestigation of each specific target business and any subsequent negotiation and drafting of related agreements, SEC disclosure and\nother documents will require substantial amounts of management\u2019s time and attention and material additional costs in connection\nwith outsourced services from accountants, attorneys, and other professionals. We will likely expend significant time and resources searching\nfor, conducting due diligence on, and negotiating transaction terms in connection with a proposed business combination that may not ultimately\ncome to fruition. In such event, all of the time and capital resources expended by the Company in such a pursuit may be lost and unrecoverable\nby the Company or its shareholders. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable business\nmay arise that force us to terminate discussions with a target company, such as the target\u2019s failure or inability to provide adequate\ndocumentation to assist in our investigation, a party\u2019s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction\nas required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive\nbid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller\u2019s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the\ntransaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for a new business and investors should be aware of them before investing\nin an enterprise such as ours.\nConflicts\nof interest may arise between us and our shareholders, directors, or management, which may have a negative impact on our ability to consummate\na business combination or favorable terms or generate revenue.\nOur\nChief Executive Officer, Mr. Ginzberg is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest\nin allocating his time between managing the Company and other businesses in which he is or may be involved. We do not intend to have\nany employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Mr. Ginzberg is not obligated to contribute any specific number of\nhours to our affairs, and he may engage in other business endeavors while he provides consulting services to the Company. If any of his\nother business affairs require him to devote substantial amounts of time to such matters, it could materially limit his ability to devote\nhis time and attention to our business which could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or generate\nrevenue.\nIt\nis possible that we obtain an operating company in which a director or officer of the Company has an ownership interest in or that he\nor she is an officer, director, or employee of. If we do obtain any business affiliated with an officer or director, such business combination\nmay be on terms other than what would be arrived at in an arms-length transaction. If any conflict of interest arises, it could adversely\naffect a business combination or subsequent operations of the Company, in which case our shareholders may see diminished value relative\nto what would have been available through a transaction with an independent third party.\nWe\nmay engage in a business combination that causes tax consequences to us and our shareholders.\nFederal\nand state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be a significant factor in considering any business combination that we may undertake.\nUnder current federal law, such transactions may be subject to significant taxation to the buyer and its shareholders under applicable\nfederal and state tax laws. While we intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences\nto the extent practicable in accordance with our business objectives, there can be no assurance that any business combination we undertake\nwill meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or similar favorable treatment or that the parties to\nsuch a transaction will obtain the tax treatment intended or expected upon a transfer of equity interests or assets. A non-qualifying\nreorganization, combination or similar transaction could result in the imposition of significant taxation, both at the federal and state\nlevels, which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction, including our shareholders.\nIt\nis unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve a business combination.\nIt\nis unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business combination. In most cases,\nbusiness combinations do not require shareholder approval under applicable law, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not afford\nour shareholders with the right to approve such a transaction. Further, Mr. Ginzberg our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, owns\nthe vast majority of our outstanding Common Stock. Accordingly, our shareholders will be relying almost exclusively on the judgement\nof our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and Chief Executive Officer and any persons on whom they may rely with respect to a potential\nbusiness combination. In order to develop and implement our business plan, may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts,\nappraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining the Company\u2019s direction and consummating any transactions contemplated\nthereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Company\u2019s future business and prospects.\nThe selection of any such persons will be made by our Board, and any expenses incurred or decisions made based on any of the foregoing\ncould prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our shareholders.\nBecause\nour search for a business combination is not presently limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific target businesses, prospective\ninvestors will be unable to evaluate the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations until such time as they\nare identified and disclosed.\nWe\nare still determining the Company\u2019s business plan, and we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating entity\nin any number of industries or sectors. Because we have not yet entered into any letter of intent or agreement to acquire a particular\nbusiness, prospective investors currently have no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s\noperations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, prospects or other metrics or qualities they deem appropriate\nin considering to invest in the Company. Further, if we complete a business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent\nin the operations of the business we acquire. For example, if we acquire a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established\noperating history, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a new business or a development stage entity.\nAlthough our management intends to evaluate and weigh the merits and risks inherent in a particular target business and make a decision\nbased on the Company and its shareholders\u2019 interests, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all the\nsignificant risks inherent in a target business, that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence or that we will ultimately\nacquire a viable business and generate material revenue therefrom. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and\nleave us with no ability to reduce the likelihood that those risks will adversely impact a target business or mitigate any harm to the\nCompany caused thereby. Should we select a course of action, or fail to select a course of action, that ultimately exposes us to unknown\nor unidentified risks, our business will be harmed and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nPast\nperformance by our management and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nWhile\nour Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in advising businesses, his past performance, the performance of other entities or persons\nwith which he is involved, or the performance of any other personnel we may retain in the future will not necessarily be an indication\nof either (i) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) the future operating results\nof the Company including with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of\nhim or any other of our personnel or their affiliates\u2019 performance as indicative of our future performance or that an investment\nin us will be profitable. In addition, an investment in the Company is not an investment in any entities affiliated with our management\nor other personnel. While management intends to endeavor to locate a viable business opportunity and generate shareholder value, there\ncan be no assurance that we will succeed in this endeavor.\nWe\nmay seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors that are outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise.\nWe\nwill consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented\nto us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for the Company. Although management intends to endeavor\nto evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain\nor assess all the significant risks, or that we will accurately determine the actual value of a prospective operating entity to acquire.\nIn the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s ability\nto evaluate and make decisions on behalf of the Company may be limited, or we may make material expenditures on additional personnel\nor consultants to assist management in the Company\u2019s operations. Investors should be aware that the information contained herein\nregarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise will not necessarily be relevant to an understanding of the business that we\nultimately elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risks\nor strategic opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, any shareholders in the Company following a business combination could suffer\na reduction in the value of their shares, and any resulting loss will likely not be recoverable.\nWe\nmay attempt to complete a business combination with a private target company about which little information is available, and such target\nentity may not generate revenue as expected or otherwise by compatible with us as expected.\nIn\npursuing our search for a business to acquire, we will likely seek to complete a business combination with a privately held company.\nVery little public information generally exists about private companies, and the only information available to us prior to making a decision\nmay be from documents and information provided directly to us by the target company in connection with the transaction. Such documents\nor information or the conclusions we draw therefrom could prove to be inaccurate or misleading. As such, we may be required to make our\ndecision on whether to pursue a potential business combination based on limited, incomplete, or faulty information, which may result\nin our subsequent operations generating less revenue than expected, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur\nability to assess the management of a prospective target business may be limited and, as a result, we may acquire a target business whose\nmanagement does not have the skills, qualifications, or abilities to enable a seamless transition, which could, in turn, negatively impact\nour results of operations.\nWhen\nevaluating the desirability of a potential business combination, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be\nlimited due to a lack of time, resources, or information. Our management\u2019s assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s\nmanagement, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Further,\nin most cases the target\u2019s management may be expected to want to manage us and replace our Chief Executive Officer. Should the\ntarget\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with their\nformer entity\u2019s merger or combination into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively\nimpacted and our shareholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.\nAny\nbusiness we acquire will likely lack diversity of operations or geographical reach, and in such case we will be subject to risks associated\nwith dependence on a single industry or region.\nOur\nsearch for a business will likely be focused on entities with a single or limited business activity and/or that operate in a limited\ngeographic area. While larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversifying their operations among different industries\nand regions, smaller companies such as ours and the entities we anticipate reviewing for a potential business combination generally lack\ndiversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of their business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely\nby risks affecting the industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. In addition to\ngeneral economic risks, we could be exposed to natural disasters, civil unrest, technological advances, and other uncontrollable developments\nthat will threaten our viability if and to the extent our future operations are limited to a single industry or region. If we do not\ndiversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations will be at risk.\nChanges\nin laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability\nto negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations.\nWe\nare subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state, and local governments. In addition to SEC regulations, any business we\nacquire in the future may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and\nexpend material amounts on compliance. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming\nand costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from\ntime to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments,\nand results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result\nin material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks\nRelated to Our Common Stock\nDue\nto factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nThere\nis currently a limited market for our Common Stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our Common Stock will develop,\neven if we are successful in consummating a business combination. Recently, the price of our Common Stock has been volatile for no reason.\nFurther, even if an active market for our Common Stock develops, it will likely be subject to by significant price volatility when compared\nto more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for\nthe foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise\ndescribed in this Report, including:\n\u25cf General speculative\nfever;\n\u25cf A prospective\nbusiness combination and the terms and conditions thereof;\n\u25cf The operating\nperformance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom;\n\u25cf The performance\nof our competitors in the marketplace, both pre- and post-combination;\n\u25cf The public\u2019s\nreaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information;\n\u25cf Changes in\nearnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies\nin the industry of a business that we acquire;\n\u25cf Variations\nin general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting\ndecline in the economy;\n\u25cf The public\ndisclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future;\n\u25cf The number\nof shares of our Common Stock that are publicly traded in the future;\n\u25cf Actions of\nour existing shareholders, including sales of Common Stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant investors;\nand\n\u25cf The employment\nor termination of key personnel.\nMany\nof these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of whether we can consummate\na business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods\nof volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities\nclass action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which would otherwise\nbe used to benefit our business.\nBecause\ntrading in our Common Stock is so limited, investors who purchase our Common Stock may depress the market if they sell Common Stock.\nOur\nCommon Stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks\ntraded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Our Common Stock itself infrequently\ntrades.\nThe\nmarket price of our Common Stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are sold at once or in large blocks.\nPresently\nthe market for our Common Stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders\nmay sell their shares of our Common Stock which may depress the market price. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the\npublic market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, which could\nreduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders.\nFuture\nissuance of our Common Stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition\nand any resulting financing.\nWe\nmay issue additional shares of our Common Stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our Common Stock could substantially\ndilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock in the public market, either\nin the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in a business combination which received our Common Stock as\nconsideration or by investors who has previously acquired such Common Stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common\nStock.\nDue\nto recent changes to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our Common Stock may become subject to limitations or reductions\non stock price, liquidity, or volume.\nOn\nSeptember 16, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nThis Rule applies to broker-dealers who quote securities listed on over-the-counter markets such as our Common Stock. The Rule as amended\nprohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations on OTC markets for an issuer\u2019s securities unless they are based on current\npublicly available information about the issuer. When it becomes effective, the amended Rule will also limit the Rule\u2019s \u201cpiggyback\u201d\nexception, which allows broker-dealers to publish quotations for a security in reliance on the quotations of a broker-dealer that initially\nperformed the information review required by the Rule, to issuers with current publicly available information or issuers that are up-to-date\nin their Exchange Act reports. As of this date, we are uncertain as what actual effect the Rule may have on us.\nThe\nRule changes could harm the liquidity and/or market price of our Common Stock by either preventing our shares from being quoted or driving\nup our costs of compliance. Because we are a voluntary filer under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and not a public reporting company,\nthe practical impact of these changes is to require us to maintain a level of periodic disclosure we are not presently required to maintain,\nwhich would cause us to incur material additional expenses. Further, if we cannot or do not provide or maintain current public information\nabout our company, our stockholders may face difficulties in selling their shares of our Common Stock at desired prices, quantities,\nor times, or at all, as a result of the amendments to the Rule.", "PERMNO": 12014, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CBPI"}
