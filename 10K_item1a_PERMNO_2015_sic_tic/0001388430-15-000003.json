Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and investors may lose all or part of their investment. This section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Equipment Leasing Industry\nThe demand for leased containers depends on many political, economic and other factors beyond our control.\nA significant amount of our revenue comes from activities related to the leasing of containers. Our ability to continue successfully leasing containers to container shipping lines, earning management fees on leased containers and attracting third-party investors to purchase container portfolios from us depends in part upon the continued demand for leased containers. The demand for containers is affected by numerous factors.\nDemand for containers depends largely on the rate of world trade and economic growth, with consumer demand being one of the most critical factors affecting this growth. Economic downturns in one or more countries or regions, particularly in the United States, China, Europe and other consumer-oriented economies, could result in a reduction in world containerized trade growth or in demand by container shipping lines for leased containers. In Europe, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, the loss of value by the Euro and related effects on the European banking system have contributed to growing instability in the European currency and credit markets. Further deterioration of European economic conditions, the dissolution of the European Union or the Euro, or a significant loss of value by the Euro could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s containers globally.\nEconomic recessions may result in a decline in the future demand for containers by our customers and could lead to an increase in the number of containers returned to us, reduce our equipment rental revenue, reduce utilization of our fleet, increase our operating expenses (such as storage, bad debt and repositioning costs) and have an adverse effect on our future financial performance. Much of our leasing business involves shipments of goods exported from Asia. From time to time, there have been economic disruptions, health scares, financial turmoil, natural disasters and political instability in Asia and in the Middle East. If these events were to occur in the future, they could adversely affect our container lessees and the general demand for shipping and lead to reduced demand for leased containers or otherwise adversely affect us. Other general factors affecting demand for leased containers, utilization and per diem rates include the following:\n\u00b7\navailable supply and prices of new and used containers;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions and competitive pressures in the shipping industry;\n\u00b7\nshifting trends and patterns of cargo traffic;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and terms of container financing;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values;\n\u00b7\novercapacity or undercapacity of the container manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nthe lead times required to purchase containers;\n\u00b7\nthe number of containers purchased by competitors and container lessees;\n\u00b7\ncontainer ship fleet overcapacity or undercapacity;\n\u00b7\nincreased repositioning by container shipping lines of their own empty containers to higher-demand locations in lieu of leasing containers from us;\n\u00b7\nconsolidation or withdrawal of individual container lessees in the container shipping industry;\n\u00b7\nimport/export tariffs and restrictions;\n\u00b7\ncustoms procedures, foreign exchange controls and other governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters that are severe enough to affect local and global economies;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic factors;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7\nfuture regulations which could restrict our current business practices and increase our cost of doing business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAll of these factors are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors will vary over time, often quickly and unpredictably, and any change in one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these factors also influence decisions by our customers to lease or buy containers. Should one or more of these factors influence our customers to buy a larger percentage of the containers they operate, our utilization rate would decrease, resulting in decreased revenue and increased storage and repositioning costs.\nContinuing turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa could cause increases in oil prices or disruptions in oil supplies which could substantially affect global trade and our business.\nRecent protests, violence and political instability in certain Middle East and North African countries have increased the risk of political turmoil spreading through the region. Such events could cause the price of oil to increase or disrupt world oil supplies. Our business is dependent on the volume of global trade. Such events could cause substantial volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets and global trade, which could harm our business.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe have operations in locations subject to natural disasters such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt our operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, on March 11, 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a series of tsunamis resulting in negative direct economic effects to the Japanese economy. Although the earthquake in Japan did not cause a disruption in our operations in the region, any future natural disasters in Japan or elsewhere in the world where we have business operations could lead to disruption of the regional and global economies, which could result in a decrease in demand for leased equipment, adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPer diem rates for our leased containers may decrease, which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nPer diem rates for our leased containers depend on a large number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe type and length of the lease;\n\u00b7\nembedded residual assumptions;\n\u00b7\nthe type and age of the containers;\n\u00b7\nthe number of new units available for lease by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe location of the containers being leased;\n\u00b7\nthe price of new containers; and\n\u00b7\ninterest rates.\nBecause steel is the major component used in the construction of new containers, the price of new containers and per diem rates on new containers are highly correlated with the price of raw steel. For example, steel prices decreased during 2014, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in new container prices. We cannot predict container prices in the future. If newly manufactured container prices continue to decline, we may need to lease the containers at low return rates or at a loss.\nPer diem rates may be negatively impacted by the entrance of new leasing companies, overproduction of new containers by manufacturers and over-buying of containers by container shipping lines and leasing competitors. In the event that the container shipping industry were to be characterized by overcapacity in the future, or if available supply of containers were to increase significantly as a result of, among other factors, new companies entering the business of leasing and selling containers, both utilization and per diem rates may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks associated with re-leasing containers after their initial long term lease.\nContainers used in our fleet have an average useful economic life that is generally between 12 and 15 years. When we purchase newly manufactured containers, we typically lease them out under long-term leases with terms of 3 to 8 years at a lease rate that is correlated to the price paid for the container. As containers leased under term leases are not leased out for their full economic life, we face risks associated with re-leasing containers after their initial long term lease at a rate that continues to provide a reasonable economic return based on the initial purchase price of the container. If prevailing container lease rates decline significantly between the time a container is initially leased out and when its initial long term lease expires, or if overall demand for containers declines, we may be unable to earn a sufficient lease rate from the re-leasing of containers when their initial term leases expire. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGains and losses associated with the disposition of used containers may fluctuate and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough our revenues primarily depend upon equipment leasing, our profitability is also affected by the gains or losses we realize on the sale of used containers because, in the ordinary course of our business, we sell certain containers when they are returned to us. The volatility of the selling prices and gains or losses from the disposal of such equipment may be significant. Used container selling prices, which can vary substantially, depend upon, among other factors, the cost of new containers, the global supply and demand balance for containers, the location of the containers, the supply and demand balance for used containers at a particular location, the repair condition of the container, refurbishment needs, materials and labor costs and equipment obsolescence. Most of these factors are outside of our control. Operating leases, which represent the predominant form of leases in our portfolio, are subject to greater selling price risk than finance leases.\nContainers are typically sold if it is in our best interest to do so, after taking into consideration earnings prospects, book value, remaining useful life, repair condition, suitability for leasing or other uses and the prevailing local sales price for containers. Gains or losses on the disposition of used containers will fluctuate and may be significant if we sell large quantities of used containers.\nUsed container prices and our disposal gains have decreased in the last two years and disposal prices are nearing our current residual values. However, they could decrease further from current levels which would have a negative impact on our financial performance and cash flow. These effects could be significant if used container sale prices decreased rapidly.\nWe may incur significant costs to reposition containers.\nWhen lessees return containers to locations where supply exceeds demand, we may make a decision to reposition containers to higher demand areas rather than sell the container and realize a loss on that sale. Repositioning expenses vary depending on geographic location, distance, freight rates and other factors, and may not be fully covered by drop-off charges collected from the last lessee of the containers or pick-up charges paid by the new lessee. We seek to limit the number of units that can be returned and impose surcharges on containers returned to areas where demand for such containers is not expected to be strong. However, market conditions may not enable us to continue such practices. In addition, we may not accurately anticipate which port locations will be characterized by high or low demand in the future, and our current contracts will not protect us from repositioning costs if ports that we expect to be high-demand ports turn out to be low-demand ports at the time leases expire.\nLessee defaults may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition by decreasing revenue and increasing storage, repositioning, collection and recovery expenses.\nOur equipment is leased to numerous equipment lessees. Lessees are required to pay rent and indemnify us for damage to or loss of equipment. Lessees may default in paying rent and performing other obligations under their leases. A delay or diminution in amounts received under the leases (including leases on our managed equipment), or a default in the performance of maintenance or other lessee obligations under the leases could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to make payments on our debt.\nOur cash flows from equipment, principally equipment rental revenue, management fee revenue, gain on sale of equipment portfolios, gain on disposition of used equipment and commissions earned on the sale of equipment on behalf of equipment investors, are affected significantly by the ability to collect payments under leases and the ability to replace cash flows from terminating leases by re-leasing or selling equipment on favorable terms. All of these factors are subject to external economic conditions and the performance by lessees and service providers that are not within our control.\nWhen lessees default, we may fail to recover all of our equipment and the equipment we do recover may be returned to locations where we will not be able to quickly re-lease or sell it on commercially acceptable terms. We may have to reposition the equipment to other places where we can re-lease or sell it, which could be expensive depending on the locations and distances involved. Following repositioning, we may need to repair the equipment and pay equipment depots for storage until the equipment is re-leased. For our owned equipment these costs will directly reduce our income before taxes and for our managed equipment, lessee defaults will increase operating expenses, and thus reduce our management fee revenue. We maintain insurance to reimburse the Company and third-party investors for such customer defaults. The insurance agreements are subject to deductibles of up to $3.0 million per occurrence and have significant exclusions and, therefore, may not be sufficient to prevent us from suffering material losses. Additionally, the increase in claims made by the Company under such insurance agreements may result in such insurance not being available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and we intend to borrow additional amounts under our credit facilities to purchase equipment and make acquisitions and other investments. We expect that we will maintain a significant amount of indebtedness on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2014, our total outstanding debt (including capital lease obligations) was $1,264.5 million. Interest expense on such debt will be $7.2 million per quarter for 2015, assuming floating interest rates remain consistent with those as of December 31, 2014. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness when it becomes due, or, if refinancing is available, that it can be obtained on terms that we can afford.\nOur credit facilities require us to pay a variable rate of interest, which will increase or decrease based on variations in certain financial indexes, and fluctuations in interest rates can significantly decrease our profits. We do not have any hedge or similar contracts that would protect us against changes in interest rates.\nThe amount of our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the following:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, and any failure to comply with such obligations, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which could lead to, among other things, an acceleration of our indebtedness or foreclosure on the assets securing our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u00b7\nmaking it difficult for us to pay dividends on, or repurchase, our common stock;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors having less debt;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; and\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay our debt and related obligations and have sufficient funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs or compete successfully in our industry.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service and repay our outstanding indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and repay our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. As of December 31, 2014, our total outstanding debt (including capital lease obligations and collateralized financing obligations) was $1,264.5 million. Interest expense on such debt will be $7.2 million per quarter, assuming floating interest rates remain consistent with those at December 31, 2014. These amounts will increase to the extent we borrow additional funds. It is possible that:\n\u00b7\nour business will not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay our debt and to fund working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nfuture borrowings will not be available under our current or future credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to refinance our debt; or\n\u00b7\nwe will not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur credit facilities impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, significant operating, financial and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.\nRestrictions imposed by our credit facilities or other indebtedness will limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\n\u00b7\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u00b7\nissue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and certain types of investments;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ncreate liens;\n\u00b7\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nrestrict dividends, distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these restrictions, including breach of financial covenants, could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness, which would constitute substantially all of our equipment assets.\nWe may incur future asset impairment charges and additional depreciation expense.\nAn asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our long-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of reductions in demand for specific container types, a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset type, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.\nIf an asset, or group of assets, is considered to be impaired, it may also indicate that the residual value of the associated equipment type needs to be reduced. If residual values of our rental equipment are lowered, then our depreciation expense will increase, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of equipment lessees. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these equipment lessees, or a default from any large equipment lessee, could result in a significant loss of revenue and cash flow.\nWe have derived, and believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue and cash flow from a limited number of equipment lessees. Revenue from our ten largest lessees represented 55.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, with revenue from our single largest lessee accounting for 11.4%, or $25.9 million. As our business grows, we expect the proportion of revenue generated by our larger customers to continue to increase. The loss of such a customer would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a default by any of our largest lessees would result in a major reduction in our leasing revenue, large repossession expenses, potentially large lost equipment charges and a material adverse impact on our performance and financial condition.\nConsolidation and concentration in the container shipping industry could decrease the demand for leased containers.\nWe primarily lease containers to container shipping lines. We estimate that container shipping lines require approximately two TEUs of available containers for every TEU of capacity on their container ships. The container shipping lines have historically relied on a large number of leased containers to satisfy their needs. Consolidation of major container shipping lines could create efficiencies and decrease the demand that container shipping lines have for leased containers because they may be able to fulfill a larger portion of their needs through their owned container fleets. It could also create concentration of credit risk if the number of our container lessees decreases due to consolidation. Additionally, large container shipping lines with significant resources could choose to manufacture their own containers, which would decrease their demand for leased containers and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in market price, availability or transportation costs of containers could adversely affect our ability to maintain our supply of containers.\nWe currently purchase almost all of our containers from manufacturers based in China. If it became more expensive for us to procure containers in China or to transport these units at a low cost from China to the locations where they are needed by our container lessees because of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Chinese Yuan, further consolidation among container suppliers, increased tariffs imposed by the United States or other governments or for any other reason, we may have to seek alternative sources of supply. While we are not currently dependent on any single current manufacturer of our containers, we may not be able to make alternative arrangements quickly enough to meet our container needs, and the alternative arrangements may increase our costs. The availability of containers depends significantly on the availability and cost of steel in China. If a shortage of steel develops either in China or worldwide, container manufacturers may not be able to meet our demand for new containers, which would limit our ability to add new containers to our fleet.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTerrorist attacks, the threat of such attacks, piracy or the outbreak of war and hostilities could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of such attacks have contributed to economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and further acts or threats of terrorism, violence, war or hostilities could similarly affect world trade and the industries in which we and our equipment lessees operate. For example, worldwide containerized trade dramatically decreased in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, which affected demand for leased equipment. In addition, terrorist attacks, threats of terrorism, piracy or threats thereof, violence, war or hostilities may directly impact ports, depots, our facilities or those of our suppliers or equipment lessees, and could impact our sales and our supply chain. A severe disruption to the worldwide ports system and flow of goods could result in a reduction in the level of international trade and lower demand for our equipment. We maintain liability insurance which in the aggregate provides coverage of up to $50.0 million that we believe would apply to claims arising from a terrorist attack, and our lease agreements require our lessees to indemnify us for all costs, liabilities and expenses arising out of the use of our equipment, including property damage to the equipment, damage to third-party property and personal injury. However, our lessees may not have adequate resources to honor their indemnity obligations and our insurance coverage is subject to large deductibles and significant exclusions. Accordingly, we may not be protected in all cases from liability (and expenses in defending against claims of liability) arising from a terrorist attack.\nIt is also possible that one of our containers could be involved in a terrorist attack. Although our lease agreements require our lessees to indemnify us against all damages arising out of the use of our containers, and we carry insurance to potentially offset any costs in the event that our customer indemnifications prove to be insufficient, our insurance does not cover certain types of terrorist attacks, and we may not be fully protected from liability of the reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes one of our containers.\nOur senior executives are critical to the success of our business and our inability to retain them or recruit new personnel could adversely affect our business.\nMost of our senior executives and other management-level employees have over ten years of industry experience. We rely on this knowledge and experience in our strategic planning and in our day-to-day business operations. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to retain our senior management, the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our success also depends on our ability to retain our experienced sales force and technical personnel as well as recruiting new skilled sales, marketing and technical personnel. Competition for these individuals in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new equipment lessees and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer.\nWe rely on our proprietary information technology system to conduct our business. If this system fails to adequately perform its functions, or if we experience an interruption in its operation, our business, results of operations and financial prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is highly dependent on our proprietary information technology system. We rely on our system to track transactions, such as repair and depot charges and changes to book value, and movements associated with each of our owned or managed equipment units. We use the information provided by this system in our day-to-day business decisions in order to effectively manage our lease portfolio and improve customer service. We also rely on it for the accurate tracking of the performance of our managed fleet for each third-party investor. The failure of our system to perform as we expect could disrupt our business, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and cause our relationships with lessees and third-party investors to suffer. In addition, our information technology system is vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power loss and computer systems failures, unauthorized breach and viruses. Any such interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe face extensive competition in the equipment leasing industry.\nWe may be unable to compete favorably in the highly competitive equipment leasing business. We compete with a number of major leasing companies, many smaller lessors, manufacturers of equipment, companies and financial institutions offering finance leases, promoters of equipment ownership and leasing as a tax-efficient investment, container shipping lines, which sometimes lease their excess container stocks, and suppliers of alternative types of containers for freight transport. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources and access to capital than we do. Additionally, some of these competitors may have large, underutilized inventories of equipment, which could lead to significant downward pressure on per diem rates, margins and prices of equipment.\nOur business requires large amounts of working capital to fund our operations. We are aware that some of our competitors have had ownership changes in recent years. As a consequence, these competitors may have greater resources available to aggressively seek to expand their market share. This could include offering lease rates with which we cannot effectively compete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompetition among equipment leasing companies depends upon many factors, including, among others, per diem rates; lease terms, including lease duration, drop-off restrictions and repair provisions; customer service; and the location, availability, quality and individual characteristics of equipment units. New entrants into the leasing business have been attracted by the high rate of containerized trade growth in recent years. New entrants may be willing to offer pricing or other terms that we are unwilling or unable to match. As a result, we may not be able to maintain a high utilization rate or achieve our growth plans.\nOur entry into the railcar leasing business could have an adverse effect on our overall profitability if we do not succeed in this line of business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have invested $89.6 million in railcar assets. The railcar leasing business involves different customers, equipment, storage and handling facilities and other operating issues that are different from our traditional container leasing business. This business is competitive and dominated by well capitalized industry players. We cannot assure you that this business will be successful and profitable.\nThe international nature of our business exposes us to numerous risks.\nOur ability to enforce lessees\u2019 obligations will be subject to applicable law in the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. As containers are predominantly located on international waterways, it is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the jurisdictions in which enforcement proceedings may be commenced. For example, repossession from defaulting lessees may be difficult and more expensive in jurisdictions in which laws do not confer the same security interests and rights to creditors and lessors as those in the United States and in jurisdictions where recovery of containers from defaulting lessees is more cumbersome. As a result, the relative success and expedience of enforcement proceedings with respect to containers in various jurisdictions cannot be predicted.\nWe are also subject to risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact our business. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nregional or local economic downturns;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental policy or regulation;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the countries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nimport and export duties and quotas;\n\u00b7\nvalue-added tax and other sales-type taxes which could result in additional costs to us if they are not properly collected or paid;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u00b7\ninternational incidents;\n\u00b7\nwar, hostilities, terrorist attacks, piracy, or the threat of any of these events;\n\u00b7\ngovernment instability;\n\u00b7\nnationalization of foreign assets;\n\u00b7\ngovernment protectionism;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with export controls, including those of the U.S. Department of Commerce;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with import procedures and controls, including those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security;\n\u00b7\nconsequences from changes in tax laws, including tax laws pertaining to container investors;\n\u00b7\npotential liabilities relating to foreign withholding taxes;\n\u00b7\nlabor or other disruptions at key ports;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions.\nOne or more of these factors could impair our current or future international operations and, as a result, harm our overall business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may incur costs associated with new security regulations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to regulations promulgated in various countries, including the United States, seeking to protect the integrity of international commerce and prevent the use of equipment for international terrorism or other illicit activities. For example, the Container Security Initiative, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and Operation Safe Commerce are among the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that are designed to enhance security for cargo moving throughout the international transportation system by identifying existing vulnerabilities in the supply chain and developing improved methods for ensuring the security of containerized cargo entering and leaving the United States. Moreover, the International Convention for Safe Containers, 1972 (CSC), as amended, adopted by the International Maritime Organization, applies to new and existing containers and seeks to maintain a high level of safety of human life in the transport and handling of containers by providing uniform international safety regulations. As these regulations develop and change, we may incur compliance costs due to the acquisition of new, compliant equipment and/or the adaptation of existing equipment to meet new requirements imposed by such regulations. Additionally, certain companies are currently developing or may in the future develop products designed to enhance the security of equipment transported in international commerce. Regardless of the existence of current or future government regulations mandating the safety standards of intermodal shipping equipment, our competitors may adopt such products or our equipment lessees may require that we adopt such products. In responding to such market pressures, we may incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in numerous tax jurisdictions. A taxing authority within any of these jurisdictions may challenge our operating structure which could result in additional taxes, interest and penalties that could materially impact our financial conditions and our future financial results.\nWe have implemented a number of structural changes with respect to our Company and its domestic and international subsidiaries in an effort to reduce our income tax obligations in countries in which we operate. There can be no assurance that our tax structure and the amount of taxes we pay in any of these countries will not be challenged by the taxing authorities in the countries in which we operate. If the tax authorities challenge our tax positions or the amount of taxes paid for the purchase, lease or sale of equipment in each jurisdiction in which we operate, we could incur substantial expenses associated with defending our tax position as well as expenses associated with the payment of any additional taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed on us. The payment of these amounts could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental liability may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants to air, ground and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees\u2019 current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner or operator of a container may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a container without regard to whether or not the spill or discharge was the fault of the owner or operator. While we typically maintain liability insurance and typically require lessees to provide us with indemnity against certain losses, insurance coverage may not be sufficient, or available, to protect against any or all liabilities and such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect us against losses arising from environmental damage. Moreover, our lessees may not have adequate resources, or may refuse to honor their indemnity obligations and our insurance coverage is subject to large deductibles, coverage limits and significant exclusions. Additionally, many countries, including the United States, restrict, prohibit or otherwise regulate the use of chemical refrigerants due to their ozone depleting and global warming effects. Over 99% of our refrigerated containers currently use R134A or 404A refrigerant. While R134A and 404A do not contain CFCs (which have been restricted since 1995), the European Union has instituted regulations to phase out the use of R134A in automobile air conditioning systems beginning in 2011 due to concern that the release of R134A into the atmosphere may contribute to global warming. While the European Union regulations do not currently restrict the use of R134A in refrigerated containers or trailers, it is possible that the phase out of R134A in automobile air conditioning systems will be extended to intermodal containers in the future. Further, certain manufacturers of refrigerated containers, including the largest manufacturer of cooling machines for refrigerated containers, have begun testing units that utilize alternative refrigerants, such as carbon dioxide, that may have less global warming potential than R134A and 404A. If future regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers using R134A or 404A refrigerants, we could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses. In addition, refrigerated containers that are not retrofitted may become difficult to lease and command lower rental rates and disposal prices.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFurthermore, installation of the insulation foam in the walls of refrigerated containers involves the use of a blowing agent that contains CFCs. Manufacturers are in various stages of phasing out the use of this blowing agent in the manufacturing process. However, if future regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers with insulation manufactured with this blowing agent we could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses and those that are not retrofitted may become more difficult to lease and command lower rental rates and disposal prices.\nUse of counterfeit and improper refrigerant in refrigeration machines for refrigerated containers could result in irreparable damage to the refrigeration machines, death or personal injury, and materially impair the value of our refrigerated container fleet.\nThere are reports of counterfeit and improper refrigerant gas being used to service refrigeration machines. The use of this counterfeit gas has led to the explosion of several refrigeration machines within the industry. A small number of these incidents have resulted in personal injury or death and, in all cases, the counterfeit gas has led to irreparable damage to the refrigeration machines.\nA testing procedure has been developed and approved by the International Institute of Container Lessors to determine whether counterfeit gas has been used to service a refrigeration machine. These tests are carried out on our refrigeration machines when they are off-hired and returned to a depot. If such tests are not proven safe and effective or if the use of such counterfeit and improper refrigerant is more widespread than currently believed, the value of our refrigerated container fleet and our ability to lease refrigerated containers could be materially impaired and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may face litigation involving our management of equipment for third-party investors.\nWe manage equipment for third-party investors under management agreements that are negotiated with each third-party investor. We make no assurances to third-party investors that they will make any amount of profit on their investment or that our management activities will result in any particular level of income or return of their initial capital. Although our management agreements contain contractual protections and indemnities that are designed to limit our exposure to litigation relating to these investments, such provisions may not be effective and we may be subject to a significant loss in a successful litigation by a third-party investor.\nOur 80 percent ownership in CAIJ, Inc., a container investment arranger and advisor focused on arranging container investments with Japanese investors, may subject us to material litigation risks and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nCAIJ, Inc. (CAIJ) was formed and began operation in 2007 for the purpose of arranging investments in our containers with Japanese investors. CAIJ has arranged a significant amount of investments and we expect that CAIJ will arrange more container investments in the future. Because we are the seller and manager of the containers that will be sold to investors on whose behalf CAIJ acts as an arranger and advisor, there is an inherent conflict of interest between us, CAIJ and the investors. We disclose this inherent conflict of interest to third-party investors prior to any sale to them, but we do not provide them with any assurances that they will realize a specific or any investment return on the containers purchased from, and managed by, us. In the event that these third-party investors realize losses on their investments or believe that the returns on their investments are lower than expected, they may make claims, including bringing lawsuits, against CAIJ or us for our alleged failure to act in their best interests or make appropriate disclosures to them. Any such claims could result in the payment of legal expenses and damages and also damage our reputation with third-party investors and potential third-party investors and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain liens may arise on our equipment.\nDepot operators, repairmen and transporters may come into possession of our equipment from time to time and have sums due to them from lessees or sub-lessees of equipment. In the event of nonpayment of those charges by lessees or sub-lessees, we may be delayed in, or entirely barred from, repossessing equipment, or be required to make payments or incur expenses to discharge liens on our equipment.\nThe lack of an international title registry for containers increases the risk of ownership disputes.\nThere is no internationally recognized system of recordation or filing to evidence our title to containers nor is there an internationally recognized system for filing security interests in containers. Although we have not incurred material problems with respect to this lack of an internationally recognized system, the lack of an international title recordation system for containers could result in disputes with lessees, end-users, or third parties who may improperly claim ownership of the containers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to U.S. Executive Orders and U.S. Treasury Sanctions Regulations regarding doing business in or with certain nations and specially designated nationals.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to U.S. Executive Orders and U.S. Treasury Sanctions Regulations restricting or prohibiting business dealings in or with certain nations and with certain specially designated nationals (individuals and legal entities). Any determination that we have violated such Executive Orders and U.S. Treasury Sanctions Regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or joint ventures in the future that could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and joint ventures in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty integrating personnel and financial and other systems;\n\u00b7\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel; and\n\u00b7\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. Also, the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business. Acquisitions or joint ventures may not be successful, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.\nA new standard for lease accounting under GAAP has been proposed which could have a financial impact on our business and may negatively impact the market behavior of our customers.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a jointly developed proposal on lease accounting that could significantly change the accounting and reporting for lease arrangements. The main objective of the proposed standard is to create a new accounting model for both lessees and lessors, replacing the existing concepts of operating and capital leases with models based on \u201cright-of-use\u201d concepts. The new models would result in the elimination of most off-balance sheet lease financing for lessees. The FASB\u2019s document is in the form of an exposure draft of a proposed Accounting Standards Update, Leases (Topic 840) (ED), issued in August 2010, and would apply to the accounting for all leases, with some exceptions.\nIn May 2013, after considering constituents\u2019 comments, the FASB issued a revised exposure draft, Accounting Standards Update, Leases (Topic 842): a revision of the 2010 proposed Accounting Standards Update, Leases (Topic 840). The objective of the revised ED is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information. The revised ED does not specify an effective date and the Boards will consider feedback they receive before determining one. In January 2014, the FASB and IASB began their re-deliberations of the proposals included in the May 2013 ED with an emphasis on (1) lessor accounting model, (2) accounting for \u201cType A\u201d leases by lessors, (3) lessee accounting model and (4) lessee small-ticket leases. No final decisions have been reached to date.\nWhile there is no specific effective date on the ED, it will likely not be before 2017. If there are future changes in GAAP with regard to how we and our customers must account for leases, it could change the way we and our customers conduct our businesses. As a result, we are unable to determine how the proposed changes could affect our business, but they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could reduce our profitability.\nMost of our revenues and costs are billed in U.S. dollars. Our operations and used equipment sales in locations outside of the U.S. have some exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and trade growth and the direction of trade flows can be influenced by large changes in relative currency values. In addition, most of our equipment fleet is manufactured in China. Although the purchase price is in U.S. dollars, our manufacturers pay labor and other costs in the local currency, the Chinese yuan. To the extent that our manufacturers\u2019 costs increase due to changes in the valuation of the Chinese yuan, the dollar price we pay for equipment could be affected. Adverse or large exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may remain volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, new products or services by us or our competitors, general conditions in the shipping industry and the intermodal equipment sales and leasing markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, or other events or factors which may or may not be under our control. Broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Since the initial public offering of our stock at $15.00 per share on May 16, 2007, the market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly from a high of $30.28 per share to a low of $2.12 per share through February 20, 2015. Since the trading volume on our stock is modest on a daily basis, shareholders may experience difficulties in liquidating our stock. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates or investment recommendations by any securities analysts following our business;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s response to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of common stock by us or our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception such sales may occur;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nour ability to timely address changing equipment lessee and third-party investor preferences;\n\u00b7\nequipment market and industry factors;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, if the market for companies deemed similar to us or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or financial results. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nFuture new sales of our common stock by us or outstanding shares by existing stockholders, or the perception that there will be future sales of new shares from the company or existing stockholders, may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to obtain capital through future stock offerings.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock held by our current stockholders could be sold into the public market at any time. In addition, the perception of, or actual sale of, new shares by us may materially and adversely affect our stock price and could impair our ability to obtain future capital through an offering of equity securities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe do not currently pay dividends to holders of our common stock, and we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends to holders of our common stock in the future.\nAlthough our board of directors may consider a dividend policy under which we would pay cash dividends on our common stock, any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, tax considerations and our board of directors\u2019 continuing determination that the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend program. In addition, the terms of our credit agreements contain provisions restricting the payment of cash dividends subject to certain exceptions. Consequently, investors may be required to rely on sales of their common stock as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they decrease their financial estimates or investment recommendations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares may rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control or influence the decisions or opinions of these analysts and analysts may not cover us.\nIf any analyst who covers us decreases his or her financial estimates or investment recommendation, the price of our stock could decline. If any analyst ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur founder, Mr. Hiromitsu Ogawa, will continue to have substantial control over us and could act in a manner with which other stockholders may disagree or that is not necessarily in the interests of other stockholders.\nBased upon beneficial ownership as of December 31, 2014, Mr. Ogawa beneficially owns 21.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he may have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, he may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Mr. Ogawa may have interests that are different from yours. For example, he may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your interests. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock. In addition, as Chairman of our Board of Directors, Mr. Ogawa may influence decisions to maintain our existing management and directors in office, delay or prevent changes of control of our company, or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law each contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize us to issue preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7\npermit removal of directors only for cause by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the election of directors and allow only the directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to amend our bylaws and certain articles of our certificate of incorporation, including articles relating to the classified board, the size of the board, removal of directors, stockholder meetings and actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\u00b7\nclassify our board of directors into three classes so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year; and\n\u00b7\nallow our directors to amend our bylaws.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThese provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change in control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 91979, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "CAI"}
