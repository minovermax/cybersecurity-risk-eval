Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not disclosed or not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Need to Obtain Regulatory Approvals Could Increase Our Costs and Adversely Affect Our Financial Performance.\nMany of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental or public health agencies. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. In addition, we or our distributors are often required to obtain approval or registration with foreign governments or regulatory bodies before we can import and sell our products in foreign countries.\nThe process of obtaining required approvals or registrations can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities and other costly, time-consuming procedures. These approvals and registrations can require the submission of a large amount of clinical data which can be expensive and may require significant time to obtain. It is also possible that a product will not perform at a level needed to generate the clinical data required to obtain approval or registration. The submission of an application to the FDA or other regulatory authority does not guarantee that an approval or registration to market or import the product will be received. A regulatory authority may impose requirements as a condition to granting an approval or registration, may include significant restrictions or limitations as part of any approval or clearance it grants and may delay or refuse to grant approval or registration, even though a product has been approved or registered without restrictions or limitations in another country or by another agency.\nAll in vitro diagnostic products that are to be sold in the EU must bear the CE mark indicating conformance with the essential requirements of the IVDD. We have obtained the CE mark for several of our existing products. We\nalso intend to apply for CE marks for certain of our future products and are not aware of any material reason why we would be unable to obtain those marks. However, there can be no assurance that compliance with all provisions of the IVDD will be demonstrated and the CE mark will be obtained or maintained for all products that we desire to sell in the EU. The failure to obtain or maintain the CE mark for one or more of our products could lead to the termination of strategic alliances and agreements for sales of those products in the EU.\nFailure to Comply With FDA or Other Regulatory Requirements May Require Us to Suspend Production of Our Products or Institute a Recall Which Could Result in Higher Costs and a Loss of Revenues.\nRegulation by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies impacts many aspects of our operations, and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. We and our suppliers and distributors are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies to determine compliance with QSR and Medical Device Reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO regulations. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the QSR requirements, but we cannot be sure that the FDA investigators will agree with our compliance with the QSR requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved products or place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors\u2019 advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nFailure to comply with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Ability to Respond to Changes in Regulatory Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe believe that our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, including the FDA\u2019s QSR regulations, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and the QSR requirements are subject to change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to our products, necessitate additional clinical trials or procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have the ability to change the requirements for obtaining product approval and/or impose new or additional requirements as part of the approval process. These changes or new or additional requirements may occur after the completion of substantial clinical work and other costly development activities. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in additional clinical trials and substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to obtain product approvals. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Inability to Manufacture Products in Accordance With Applicable Specifications, Performance Standards or Quality Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe materials and processes used to manufacture our products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements to ensure our products will perform in accordance with their label claims, our customers\u2019 expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods by our vendors, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers.\nAny failure or delay in our ability to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe Are Subject to Numerous Government Regulations in Addition to FDA Requirements, Which Could Increase Our Costs and Affect Our Operations.\nIn addition to the FDA and other regulations described previously, laws and regulations in some states may restrict our ability to sell products in those states. While we intend to work with state legislators and regulators to remove or modify any applicable restrictions, there is no guarantee we will be successful in these efforts.\nWe must also comply with numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, disposal of hazardous substances and labor or employment practices. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these requirements. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure To Comply With The HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Regulations May Increase Our Costs.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by certain entities and set standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including the circumstances under which use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient; a patient\u2019s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic protected health information.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations, where applicable to our business. The privacy regulations establish a uniform federal standard but do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent. Therefore, the Company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for health care data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the Company must comply with the\nlaws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Due to the enactment of HITECH, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, we could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information.\nCompliance With Regulations Governing Public Company Corporate Governance and Reporting is Complex and Expensive.\nMany laws and regulations impose obligations on public companies, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. Examples include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC\u2019s requirements for public companies to provide financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (\u201cXBRL\u201d), and the International Financial Reporting Standards conversion requirements. Our implementation of certain aspects of these laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and may require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. We continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the ultimate amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws and regulations are also subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, legal proceedings may be initiated against us, which may adversely affect our business.\nFDA Regulation of Laboratory-Developed Tests and Genetic Testing Could Affect Demand For Our Products.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. LDTs are tests developed in-house by a laboratory where the laboratory makes a determination about its ability to perform the test and whether the test yields clinically relevant information. A significant portion of the total volume of genetic or molecular testing is performed with LDTs.\nIn mid-2014, the FDA announced that it would begin regulating LDTs, including laboratory developed molecular tests, and has issued proposed guidance on the regulation of LDTs for public comment. Our subsidiary, DNAG, sells its DNA collection systems to certain laboratories and other customers for use with LDTs. One of DNAG\u2019s largest customers received a warning letter regarding its use of LDTs and, as a result, has reduced its service offerings while it works to resolve the issues defined in the warning letter. This reduction in service significantly reduced the volume of product purchased by this customer from DNAG compared to historical levels. The FDA\u2019s increased regulation of LDTs could make it more difficult for laboratories and other customers to continue offering LDTs that involve genetic or molecular testing. This, in turn, could reduce demand for DNAG\u2019s products and adversely impact our revenues.\nEvolving Legislative, Judicial and Ethical Standards on the Use of Technology and Biotechnology Could Affect Our Molecular Collection Systems Business.\nThe adoption of genetic testing is occurring within the broader context of a myriad of decisions related to genetic patenting and genotyping. Issues associated with regulatory requirements, health insurance, data access and privacy, intellectual property protection, national and international legislative initiatives and other variables impact the widespread adoption of genetic testing or specific segments or tests within the genetic testing market. These developments could impact sales of our molecular collection systems products.\nFederal and State Laws Pertaining to Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, laws constraining the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices, laws requiring the reporting of certain transactions between us and healthcare professionals and HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects security and privacy of protected health information. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of the existing requirements are new and have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. Unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could materially harm our business. In addition, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Strategy\nOur Ability to Sell Products Could be Adversely Affected by Competition From New and Existing Diagnostic Products.\nThe diagnostics industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point of care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Many of our principal competitors have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As new products enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor\u2019s products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than ours. In addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for new products that would render our technologies and products obsolete or otherwise commercially unattractive, or introduce or commercialize such products, before we can do so. If we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position, our customers may decide to use products developed by competitors which could result in a loss of revenues. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also face competition from products that are sold at a lower price. Where this occurs, customers may choose to buy lower cost products from third parties or we may be forced to sell our products at a lower price, both of which could result in a loss of revenues or a lower gross margin contribution from the sale of our products. We may also be required to increase our marketing efforts in order to compete effectively, which would increase our costs.\nConsolidation in the Healthcare Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Future Revenues and Operating Results.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. In addition, group purchasing\norganizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nOur Research, Development and Commercialization Efforts May Not Succeed and Our Competitors May Develop and Commercialize More Effective or Successful Diagnostic Products.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of new or enhanced products. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from product inception to commercial launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product in which we have invested substantial time and money.\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred $12.1 million, $10.9 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to our research and development activities.\nSuccessful products require significant development and investment, including testing to demonstrate their performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits prior to commercialization. In addition, regulatory approval must be obtained before most products may be sold. Additional development efforts on these products may be required before any regulatory authority will review them. As noted above, regulatory authorities may not approve these products for commercial sale or may substantially delay or condition approval. In addition, even if a product is developed and all applicable regulatory approvals are obtained, there may be little or no market for the product. Moreover, we may spend a significant amount of money on advertising and fail to develop a market for the product. Accordingly, if we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products, or if competitors develop more effective products or a greater number of successful new products, customers may decide not to purchase our products or may purchase and use products developed by our competitors. This would result in a loss of revenues and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nIf We Fail to Achieve Performance Objectives Under Our HCV Agreement With AbbVie, Our Financial Results and Business Prospects Could Be Adversely Affected.\nWe have entered into an agreement with AbbVie for the co-promotion of our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test into certain markets in the U.S. Under the agreement, we have granted exclusive co-promotion rights to AbbVie for the OraQuick\u00ae HCV test in these markets and we will provide certain services in support of HCV testing. In exchange for these exclusive rights and the services to be provided to AbbVie, we are eligible to receive up to $75.0 million in aggregate payments over the term of the agreement, which runs through December 31, 2019. If certain performance milestones are achieved, we will also be eligible to receive additional annual incentive fees ranging from $3.5 million to $55.5 million per year over the life of the agreement, beginning in 2015. The agreement contains certain termination, indemnification and other provisions typical of agreements of its type.\nIt is difficult to predict exactly when, or if, we will be able to achieve one or more of the performance milestones under this agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, either party may terminate the agreement before its expiration and such a termination could occur as early as December 31, 2016. If either of these events occurs, the amount of exclusivity payments and incentive fees we receive under the HCV agreement with AbbVie could be reduced and our financial results and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nFailure to Successfully Develop and Commercialize a Rapid Point-of-Care Ebola Test Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Business Prospects.\nIn late 2014, we commenced a program for the development and commercialization of a rapid, point-of-care Ebola antigen test using our OraQuick\u00ae technology platform. Although we have achieved significant\ndevelopment and clinical milestones, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our development efforts or that a developed test will perform at a level necessary to receive the regulatory approvals required for its use. In addition, it is uncertain whether we will be successful in commercializing this product. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are seeking external funding for our development program along with substantial and sustainable purchase commitments for our Ebola test. Failure to successfully complete development, obtain the required regulatory approvals or receive adequate development funding and purchase commitments would likely result in termination of this project.\nFailure to Achieve Our Financial and Strategic Objectives Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business Prospects.\nAs a result of any number of risk factors identified in this Annual Report, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our financial and strategic objectives, including our efforts to increase sales of our products, including the OraQuick\u00ae HCV test or the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test, achieve the performance milestones under our HCV agreement with AbbVie, or continue growing our molecular collection systems business. In addition, the funds for research, clinical development and other projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations. If our business slows and we have less money available to fund research and development and clinical programs, we will have to decide at that time which programs to cut, and by how much. Similarly, if adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our business. Our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology, product, clinical and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf We Lose Our Key Personnel or Are Unable to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel as Necessary, Our Business Could be Harmed.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the contributions of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products and other life science businesses. Our ability to recruit such employees will depend on a number of factors, including compensation, benefits, work location and the prospects for advancement within our organization. We generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to work for us for any specified period.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products, to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support research, development and clinical programs. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced scientists and other personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms.\nAcquisitions or Investments May Not Generate the Expected Benefits and Could Disrupt Our Ongoing Business, Distract Our Management, Increase Our Expenses and Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe may enter into strategic acquisitions or investments as a way to expand our business. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nSuitable acquisitions or investments may not be found or consummated on terms or schedules that are satisfactory to us or consistent with our objectives;\n\u2022\nThe benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, our inexperience with new businesses or markets, general economic conditions and increased competition;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s personnel, assets, management, information technology systems, accounting policies and practices, products and/or technology into our business;\n\u2022\nWorse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u2022\nAcquisitions may require substantial expense and management time and could disrupt our business;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition and subsequent integration activities may require greater capital and other resources than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, stockholder lawsuits, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in the loss of our or the acquired company\u2019s key personnel, customers, distributors or suppliers; and\n\u2022\nAn acquisition of a foreign business may involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exposure, liability or restrictions under foreign laws or regulations, and our inability to successfully assimilate differences in foreign business practices or overcome language or cultural barriers.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the above or other factors may prevent us from achieving all or a significant part of the benefits expected from an acquisition or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\nOur Revenues Could be Affected by Third-Party Reimbursement Policies and Potential Cost Constraints.\nThe end-users of our products include hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. Use of our products could be adversely impacted if end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients\u2019 healthcare insurers or payors. Our net sales could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors, including in particular the level of reimbursement for our products.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure. The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, consolidation among healthcare providers or other participants in the healthcare industry is occurring and has resulted, and may continue to result, in fewer, more powerful healthcare groups with increased purchasing power and the ability to drive down the prices paid for our products.\nChanges in Healthcare Regulation Could Affect Our Revenues, Costs and Financial Condition.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States.\nThese initiatives have ranged from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). Similar reforms may occur internationally.\nLegislative and regulatory bodies are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives and may continue to reduce funding in an effort to lower overall federal healthcare spending. The ultimate content and timing of any healthcare reform legislation and its resulting impact on us are impossible to predict. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Affordable Care Act imposes a 2.3% excise tax on certain transactions, including U.S. sales of many medical devices, which includes domestic sales of certain of our products. This new tax became effective in January 2013. It is unclear whether and to what extent other unanticipated developments resulting from the Affordable Care Act, such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance, will provide us with additional revenue to help offset this tax. If such additional revenue does not materialize or our efforts to offset the excise tax through spending cuts, price increases or other actions are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden will adversely affect our financial performance.\nNew or Changed Testing Guidelines Could Affect Sales of Our Diagnostic Products.\nFrom time to time, governmental agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can affect the usage of our HIV and HCV testing products. For example, OraQuick\u00ae HIV sales decreased 7% from 2013 to 2014, in part due to customer migration to automated fourth generation HIV immunoassays performed in a laboratory, as recommended under new testing guidelines issued by the CDC. In addition, some states have promulgated, or may in the future promulgate, laws and regulations that affect HIV or HCV testing. The issuance of new laws or guidelines, or changes in existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied by healthcare practitioners, could impact the degree to which our OraQuick\u00ae rapid HIV and HCV testing products are used. New or changed laws or guidelines could affect the number of people tested, the frequency of testing and whether testing products such as our OraQuick\u00ae HIV and HCV tests are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity as a confirmatory test or otherwise. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations.\nReductions in Government Funding and Research Budgets Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results.\nWe sell our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test and our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test into the public health market which consists of state, county and other governmental public health agencies, community based organizations, service organizations and similar entities. We also sell these products into the hospital market. Many of these customers depend to a significant degree on grants or funding provided by governmental agencies to run their operations including programs that use our products. In international markets, we often sell our products to or through foreign governmental agencies or parties funded by such agencies.\nOur subsidiary, DNAG, sells many of its products to researchers at academic institutions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government laboratories and private foundations. Many of DNAG\u2019s research customers are dependent for their funding on grants from U.S. governmental agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and agencies in other countries.\nThe level of available government grants or funding in the U.S. and elsewhere is unpredictable and may be affected by various factors including economic conditions, legislative and regulatory developments, political changes, civil unrest and changing priorities for research and development activities. Any reduction or delay in government funding could cause our customers to delay, reduce or forego purchases of our products.\nIn August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was designed to reduce federal spending over the next 10 years by $2.5 trillion. Under that law, a select committee of Congress was tasked with identifying and recommending $1.2 trillion in spending cuts by late November 2011. Because the committee did not agree on spending cuts within that time frame, certain automatic cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending became effective on March 1, 2013. As a result, there have been reductions in payments to Medicare providers and in genetic and other research funding. We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress. Although their full impact is uncertain, the spending cuts implemented under this law have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to purchase our products. This reduced funding may also increase pressure to lower the prices we charge for our products. In addition, other legislative or regulatory changes may be adopted which could adversely affect our ability to sell our current products or successfully develop and commercialize new products.\nIncreases in Demand for Our Products Could Require Us to Expend Considerable Resources or Harm Our Customer Relationships if We are Unable to Meet That Demand.\nIf we experience significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we and our suppliers may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or new manufacturing facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings. Our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity. In addition, new manufacturing equipment or facilities may require FDA approval before they can be used to manufacture our products. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products could be adversely affected.\nIf we or our suppliers are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, our sales could be adversely affected. If we fail to increase production volumes in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production problems as a result of changes that we or our suppliers make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand, we could experience shipment delays or interruptions and increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nUnexpected increases in demand for our products may require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long-term supply agreements with certain of these suppliers, but these long-term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits.\nOur inability to meet customer demand for our products could also harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe Rely on Information Technology in Our Operations and Any Material Failure, Inadequacy, Interruption or Security Breach of that Technology Could Harm Our Ability to Efficiently Operate Our Business.\nWe rely heavily on enterprise resource planning and other complex information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, invoices, shipping, interactions with our third-party logistics provider, revenue and expense accounting, online business, consumer\ncall support, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products, respond to customer inquiries, and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet. In addition, we rely on information technology systems for the development and implementation of a patient care database that we are providing as part of our services under the HCV agreement with AbbVie. This database contains patient specific healthcare information and must be maintained and operated in accordance with stringent privacy and security requirements.\nThe failure of any of the foregoing systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security of these systems through a cyber attack or otherwise, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and violation of privacy laws and regulations. Significant expenditures could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of liability and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Collaborators\nThe Use of Sole Supply Sources or Third-Party Suppliers For Critical Components of Our Products Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe currently purchase certain critical components of our products from sole supply sources or other third-party suppliers. For example, the biological antigens, nitrocellulose and certain other components required to make our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test, OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test and OraQuick\u00ae HCV test are currently purchased from sole source suppliers. Our OraSure QuickFlu\u00ae test and the fully automated high-throughput drug assays sold with our Intercept i2\u2122 device are manufactured and supplied by sole source suppliers and the conjugates used in our MICROPLATE oral fluid drugs-of-abuse assays are obtained from third party suppliers.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, DNAG, uses two third-party manufacturers to supply virtually all of its products, including its Oragene\u00ae line of collection kits. Many of the raw materials and components used in its products are also purchased from third parties, a critical one of which is obtained from a sole source supplier.\nIf our third-party suppliers are unable or unwilling to supply or manufacture a required component or product or if they make changes to a component, product or manufacturing process or do not supply materials meeting our specifications, we may need to find another source and/or manufacturer. This could require that we perform additional development work and it may be difficult to find such an alternate supply source in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We may also need to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for the use of an alternative component or for changes to our products or manufacturing process. Completing that development and obtaining such approvals could require significant time and expense and such approvals may not occur at all. The availability of critical components and products from sole supply sources or other third parties could also reduce our control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. These events could either disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products into one or more markets or completely prevent us from doing so, and could increase our costs. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nOur Failure to Maintain Existing Distribution Channels, or Develop New Distribution Channels, May Result in Lower Revenues.\nWe have marketed many of our products by collaborating with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors. Our sales depend to a substantial degree on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate.\nRelying on distributors or others to market and sell our products could harm our business for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nOur distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or otherwise market and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect;\n\u2022\nWe do not control the incentives provided by our distributors to their sales personnel and the effectiveness of these incentives could affect sales of our products;\n\u2022\nAgreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the parties;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nOur distributors may not devote sufficient resources or priority to the sale of our products;\n\u2022\nOur existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to negotiate future distribution agreements on acceptable terms or at all.\nAlthough we will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. As a result, our revenues and business could be adversely affected.\nWe May Need Strategic Partners to Assist in Developing and Commercializing Some of Our Diagnostic Products.\nAlthough we may elect to pursue some product opportunities independently, opportunities that require a technology controlled by a third party, a significant level of investment for development and commercialization or a distribution network beyond our existing sales force may necessitate involving one or more strategic partners. Our strategy for development and commercialization of products may entail entering into arrangements with distributors or other corporate partners, universities, research laboratories, licensees and others. Relying on collaborative relationships could be risky to our business for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nWe may be required to transfer material rights to such strategic partners, licensees and others;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may not devote sufficient resources or attach a sufficiently high priority to the success of our collaboration;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may be acquired by another company, decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement or become insolvent;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may develop technologies or components competitive with our products;\n\u2022\nDisagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation;\n\u2022\nCollaborators may not have sufficient capital resources; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms or at all.\nAn important recent arrangement is our HCV co-promotion agreement with AbbVie. We expect that this agreement will help increase sales of our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test and provide us with additional compensation related to the increased use of our test. However, whether this sales growth is achieved or the additional\ncompensation is received will depend, in part, on AbbVie\u2019s fulfillment of its obligations under this agreement, including its obligation to detail our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test into the physician and specialty physician office markets and the success of those detailing efforts.\nWhile we generally expect that our collaborative partners will have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities, there is no assurance that they will do so, either at the level required or at all, and the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities will be controlled by others. Reliance on strategic agreements can also make it difficult to accurately forecast our future revenues operating results. There can be no assurance that the expected revenues or profits will be fully derived from such arrangements.\nActions of Third-Party Inventory Management and Logistics Providers Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Supply Products to Our Customers.\nWe use third-party logistics providers to store and manage our finished goods inventory and ship finished product to our customers. We have selected highly reputable providers with extensive experience in the logistics field for these services. However, in the event any of our providers lose or damage our products, experience a casualty or catastrophic event at a warehouse or otherwise fail to provide safe storage and timely handling and delivery of our products, we could incur additional costs, experience difficulty in supplying our products to our customers or suffer damage to our reputation in the industry. These events could, in turn, reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology.\nThe diagnostics industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business.\nAs appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatus relating to the use or manufacture of those products. However, there have been changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may impact our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology. We have entered, and will continue to enter, into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us interests in inventions and original expressions and any patents or copyrights arising from their work. However, these parties may not honor these agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the process of filing patents, the laws governing trade secrets and proprietary information, or any agreements we enter into with employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators will provide adequate protection of our intellectual property rights. For example, employees, consultants and others who\nparticipate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, as many countries do not offer the same level of legal protection for intellectual property as the United States. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection outside of the U.S. Our trade secrets could become known through other unforeseen means. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology. Our competitors may also develop similar products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies.\nMoreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how.\nSome of our employees, including scientific and management personnel, were previously employed by competing companies. Although we encourage and expect all of our employees to abide by any confidentiality agreement with a prior employer, competing companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us.\nWe may collaborate with universities and governmental research organizations which, as a result, may acquire part of the rights to any inventions or technical information derived from our collaboration with them.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining such licenses may require the payment of substantial amounts. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded.\nWe May Become Involved in Intellectual Property Disputes, Which Could Increase our Costs and Limit or Eliminate Our Ability to Sell Products or Use Certain Technologies.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. In addition, there are a large number of patents and patent applications in our product areas, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product areas. We or our customers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products. Litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent and is expected to continue. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable.\nOur industry is characterized by a large number of patents, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. As a result, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing, that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another party\u2019s proprietary rights.\nOur involvement in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, either as a plaintiff or defendant, could adversely affect our revenues, market share, results of operations and business because:\n\u2022\nAs is common with major litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources;\n\u2022\nIts outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products;\n\u2022\nAn adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings;\n\u2022\nFailure to obtain a necessary license upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nThe pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; and\n\u2022\nA court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products.\nWe may indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if our products or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties, such as contractors, suppliers or customers, and we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us.\nWe may also become involved in other types of disputes regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reexamination, patent reissue, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. An adverse decision in any proceeding regarding intellectual property rights could result in the loss or limitation of our rights to a patent, an invention or trademark.\nThe Sales Potential for Our OraQuick\u00ae Products Could be Affected by Our Ability to Obtain Certain Licenses and by Future Litigation.\nOur OraQuick\u00ae test platform is a lateral flow assay that tests for specific antibodies or other substances. The term \u201clateral flow\u201d generally refers to a test strip through which a sample flows and which provides a test result on a portion of the strip downstream from where the sample is applied. There are numerous patents in the United States and other countries which claim lateral flow assay methods and devices. There are also patents that cover the type of analyte or antibody (i.e., HIV-1, HIV-2, HCV, Ebola, etc.) which our OraQuick\u00ae test is designed to detect. Some of these patents may broadly cover aspects of our OraQuick\u00ae test and are in force in the United States and other countries. We may not be able to make or sell the OraQuick\u00ae test in the United States or other countries where these patents are in force.\nWe have obtained licenses under several lateral flow patents, and patents covering assays directed at specific analytes, which we believe are sufficient to permit the manufacturing and sale of our OraQuick\u00ae products as currently contemplated. However, licenses under additional patents may be required and it is possible that a third party could seek to enforce one or more patents against us.\nIf we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve patent infringement litigation or it is determined that a license is required and it is not possible to negotiate or otherwise obtain a license agreement on reasonable terms under a necessary patent, our ability to manufacture and sell OraQuick\u00ae products and develop and commercialize new applications using the same technology could be limited and we may incur increased costs or damages. In such case, we may be able to modify an OraQuick\u00ae product to avoid the claim of infringement or the need for a license. However, this alternative could preclude or limit our ability to sell the OraQuick\u00ae product in the United States and other markets, which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nRisks Relating to Products, Marketing and Sales\nOur Future Success Depends Upon Market Acceptance of Our Existing and Future Products.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the market acceptance, and the timing of such acceptance, of new products such as our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test, our OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test, and other new products or technologies that may be developed or acquired. To achieve market acceptance, we and/or our distributors will likely be required to undertake substantial marketing efforts and spend significant funds to inform potential customers and the public of the existence and perceived benefits of these products. In addition, governmental funding for the purchase of our products may be needed to help create market acceptance and expand the use of our products.\nThere may be limited evidence on which to evaluate the market reaction to products that may be developed and our marketing efforts for new products may not be successful. It is also possible that governmental funding may be limited for new products, such as our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test or the new sample collection and stabilization products being commercialized by DNAG. As such, there can be no assurance that any products will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf Acceptance and Adoption of Oral Fluid Testing and Collection Products Does Not Continue, Our Future Results May Suffer.\nWe have made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid testing products, particularly for (i) HIV testing in the public health, hospital, insurance and other markets, and (ii) drugs-of-abuse testing in the workplace and criminal justice markets. Our subsidiary, DNAG, has also made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid collection products that are used with molecular testing applications. However, the degree of acceptance for these products is uncertain, and one or more markets may resist the adoption of oral fluid products as a replacement for other testing or collection methods in use today. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand the use of our oral fluid testing products in these or other markets.\nOur Customers May Resist Adoption of Rapid Point-of-Care Diagnostic Testing.\nSales of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic products, such as our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2, OraQuick\u00ae HCV and OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV tests, are an important part of our business. Rapid point-of-care tests are beneficial because, among other things, they can be administered by healthcare providers in their own facilities or used by consumers at home without sending samples to central laboratories and can help ensure that test results are delivered to the individuals being tested.\nHowever, clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories currently provide the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. In certain international markets such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Our future sales will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing by physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. We expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance or other benefits, physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to obtain diagnostic results through laboratory tests. Our failure to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers would have a negative effect on our future sales growth.\nWe Expect to Face Intense Competition From Other Providers of Diagnostic Tests and Sample Collection Products.\nOur rapid point-of-care tests compete with similar point-of-care products made by our competitors. This competition is particularly evident with respect to our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test. In addition, the\nOragene\u00ae product line sold by our subsidiary, DNAG, competes against other molecular collection products, such as blood collection kits and buccal swabs. There are a number of competitors making investments in competing technologies and products, and a number of our competitors may have a competitive advantage because of their greater financial, technical, research and other resources. Some competitors offer broader product lines, aggressively discount prices for their products and may have greater name recognition than we have. If our competitors\u2019 products take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers internally develop or acquire their own sample collection devices and use those devices in place of our products in order to reduce costs.\nVarious Factors May Affect Our Ability to Successfully Transition the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV Test To Profitability.\nDuring 2014, we changed our promotional strategy and reduced our advertising costs in order to transition our OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test to become a profitable contributor to our business. Whether this ultimately will be successful will also depend on a number of other factors, including achieving increased awareness and adoption of the product among the targeted consumer base, our ability to generate a sufficient level of sales with less investment in advertising and promotion, initiating and maintaining relationships with suppliers and retailers, reducing the use of security devices and other barriers to purchase in retail stores, obtaining and maintaining sufficient inventory of the product, the performance of our toll-free customer support center and our comprehensive consumer website relating to the product, and our ability to successfully market the product at the projected selling price. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors. In addition, retailers generally have broad product return rights which may be exercised if sufficiently high sales to consumers are not achieved. Transition of this product to profitability will also depend on whether any unanticipated adverse effects result from use of the product, or unfavorable publicity develops in respect of the product, as well as the emergence of new or existing products as competition, which are proven to be more clinically or cost-effective.\nSales of Our OraSure QuickFlu\u00ae Test May be Affected by Factors Beyond Our Control.\nWe sell a rapid flu test under the tradename OraSure QuickFlu\u00ae, primarily in the U.S. hospital and public health markets. A number of factors that are beyond our control could affect sales of this product, including:\n\u2022\nVariability in the timing of the onset, length and severity of the flu season, which typically occurs from November of one year to May of the following year;\n\u2022\nCompetition from other rapid flu tests in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nDeficiencies in the manufacture, design or performance of the product or failure by the manufacturer to meet applicable quality and regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nThe inability of our supplier to provide sufficient quantities of the product;\n\u2022\nChanges in the types or strains of influenza during a particular flu season; and\n\u2022\nLower than expected market penetration of the OraSure QuickFlu\u00ae test.\nOur Inability to Carry Out Certain of Our Marketing and Sales Plans May Make it Difficult for Us to Grow or Maintain Our Business.\nWe have implemented in the past, and we intend to implement in the future, an aggressive sales and marketing plan to expand sales of our products. Specifically, we will continue to expand the impact of our direct field sales force, use third-party distributors and manufacturers\u2019 sales representatives, and implement other sales and marketing programs. If we are unable to successfully implement these programs or modify these programs in response to evolving market and economic conditions, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer.\nOur Sales Cycles Can be Lengthy, and May Depend on Public Funding, Which Can Cause Variability and Unpredictability in Our Operating Results.\nThe sales cycles for certain of our products can be lengthy and unpredictable, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Sales of our products often involve purchasing decisions by large public and private institutions, may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grants or funding from governmental or public health agencies which can vary from period to period in both amount and timing. For example, in past years our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test has been purchased through bulk procurement or other funding provided by governmental agencies. Our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test has been purchased by customers who receive government funding, and we believe increased funding from the CDC and other agencies will be required to substantially increase the volume of HCV testing, especially in the public health market. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue, especially if current negative economic conditions continue or intensify. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives.\nWe May Face Product Liability Claims for Injuries Resulting From the Use of Our Products.\nWe may be held liable if any of our products, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of any of our technologies, causes injury of any type or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or usage. There is no assurance that we would be successful in defending any product liability lawsuits brought against us. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in:\n\u2022\nDecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\nLost revenues;\n\u2022\nDamage to our image or reputation;\n\u2022\nCosts related to litigation;\n\u2022\nIncreased product liability insurance costs;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management time and attention; and\n\u2022\nIncurrence of damages payable to plaintiffs.\nWe are selling cryosurgical products in the consumer or OTC market in the United States and certain countries and we may expand OTC sales of these products into other countries. We also sell the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test in the United States OTC market, and we are considering the expansion of this product internationally. We believe the sale of products in the OTC market increases our potential exposure to product liability and other claims.\nThe Insurance We Purchase to Cover Our Potential Business Risks May be Inadequate.\nAlthough we believe that our present product liability and other insurance coverage is sufficient to cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot be sure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of our policy limits. In addition, although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so at acceptable costs.\nWe Could Suffer Monetary Damages, Incur Substantial Costs or be Prevented From Using Technologies Important to Our Products as a Result of Legal Proceedings.\nWe have been and in the future may become involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our businesses. These may include commercial disputes, negligence claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary\ncourse of our business, including employment matters. Such lawsuits can seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, result in the termination or modification of a material contract or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales, operations or financial performance.\nPerformance of Our Products May Affect Our Revenues, Stock Price and Reputation.\nOur products are generally sold with labeling that contains performance claims approved or cleared by the FDA or other regulators. However, our products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures, may cause the product to report inaccurate information such as a false positive result or a false negative result. A false positive or negative result can also occur even when there is no apparent product defect and the customer has apparently used our product properly. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming.\nIf our products fail to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be adversely affected. Under such circumstances, we may be required to implement shipment holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations, which would increase our costs. In addition, poor performance by one or more of our products and publicity surrounding such performance could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nOur International Presence May Increase Our Risks and Expose Our Business to Regulatory, Cultural or Other Restraints.\nWe seek to increase revenue derived from international sales of our products. Our international sales accounted for $24.2 million or 23% of consolidated net revenues in 2014, $21.7 million or 22% of consolidated net revenues in 2013, and $20.3 million or 23% of consolidated net revenues in 2012. In addition, our molecular collection systems business, which accounted for $23.8 million or 22% of consolidated net revenues in 2014, is operated in Canada.\nA number of factors could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including those set forth below:\n\u2022\nUncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties;\n\u2022\nThe potential for inconsistent imposition of legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nCultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nInexperience in international markets and territories and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nExchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives;\n\u2022\nRegulatory requirements (including compliance with applicable customs regulations) and the need for reimbursement approvals;\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures, trade sanctions and import/export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain or maintain ISO certification for our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or registrations for our products;\n\u2022\nOur inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements;\n\u2022\nDiversion to the U.S. of our products sold at lower prices into international markets;\n\u2022\nThe loss of one or more distributors and difficulties or delays in obtaining new or transferred product registrations or approvals for use by a replacement distributor;\n\u2022\nLimitation of or an increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by a foreign subsidiary;\n\u2022\nThe creditworthiness of foreign distributors and customers and difficulty in collecting foreign accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nDifficulty of enforcing contractual obligations or recovering damages under foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nOur exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and various other laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us as a result of our international sales;\n\u2022\nLong sales cycles in international markets, especially for sales to foreign governments, quasi-governmental agencies and international public health agencies;\n\u2022\nThe sale of competing products by foreign competitors at prices at or below the prices we offer for our products;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;\n\u2022\nChanges in shipping costs;\n\u2022\nThe unavailability of licenses to certain patents in force in a foreign country which cover our products; and\n\u2022\nReduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the manufacture of a portion of our OraQuick\u00ae HIV-1/2 tests, and all of DNAG\u2019s products are produced in Canada. The Histofreezer\u00ae cryosurgical product sold in international markets is currently manufactured by a third party supplier located in Germany. We may enter into agreements to manufacture these or other products in additional foreign countries as well. However, economic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries.\nRisks Relating to the Economy, Our Financial Results, Investments, Credit Facilities and Need for Financing\nContinued Economic Volatility and Disruption Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Cash Flow and Financial Condition or Those of Our Customers and Suppliers.\nRecent volatile economic conditions may occur again or continue in the future. These conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers. These circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct future acquisitions or make other discretionary investments. Many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal, state and local governments, and this funding has been and may continue\nto be reduced or deferred as a result of economic conditions. These circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment, raw materials or components. Even with the improvement of economic conditions, it may take time for our customers and suppliers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing and shipping patterns. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery.\nWe Have a History of Losses and May Not Be Able to Achieve Sustained Profitability.\nWe have experienced annual net losses since 2008. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $178.3 million. Even though in the past we achieved profitability, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nOur ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will be dependent upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nCreating market acceptance for and selling increasing volumes of our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test, OraQuick\u00ae HCV test and other products in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nOur ability to increase use of our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test and earn performance incentive fees under our HCV agreement with AbbVie;\n\u2022\nThe success and revenue growth of our molecular collection systems business;\n\u2022\nThe level of expenditures we are required to make in order to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our new products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully launch new products after receipt of required regulatory approvals or the acquisition of rights to those products;\n\u2022\nThe degree to which our major distributors comply with their contractual obligations, including minimum purchase commitments;\n\u2022\nWhether we are successful in obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals and registrations for our new products;\n\u2022\nThe level of competition, including the degree to which competitors sell lower priced products or more attractive offerings to compete with our products;\n\u2022\nChanges in economic conditions in domestic or international markets, such as economic downturns, reduced demand, inflation and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve our targets for growth in revenues;\n\u2022\nChanges in distributor buying patterns or a buildup of significant quantities in our distributors\u2019 inventories or distribution channels; and\n\u2022\nThe costs and results of patent infringement, product liability and other litigation or claims asserted against us.\nWe May Experience Fluctuations in Our Financial Results or Fail to Meet Our Financial Projections.\nOur operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our financial projections for future periods are based on a number of assumptions, including estimated demand for our products. However, sales to our distributors and other customers may fall short of expectations because of lower than estimated customer demand or other factors, including continued volatility and disruption in economic conditions,\nincreasing competition, reduced governmental funding and other circumstances described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs could also contribute to the variability of our financial results.\nCustomers in the markets we serve often submit a high percentage of purchase orders in the third month of a calendar quarter. Although this can vary from quarter to quarter, many customers make purchase decisions late in a quarter due to budgetary or financial requirements. This can make it difficult to accurately forecast whether we will achieve our quarterly sales forecasts and can cause variability in our operating results.\nIn addition, our products provide different contributions to our gross margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our Common Stock.\nOur Estimates or Judgments Relating to Critical Accounting Policies Are Based on Assumptions That Can Change or Prove to be Incorrect.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to:\n\u2022\nRevenue recognition;\n\u2022\nPotential impairment of long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill;\n\u2022\nCustomer sales returns and allowances;\n\u2022\nAllowance for uncollectible accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nReserve for inventory write-downs;\n\u2022\nStock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nIncome taxes; and\n\u2022\nContingencies.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nChanges in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and, historically, most of our international sales have also been denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result, in the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nonetheless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets.\nIn addition, the revenues and operating results of our subsidiary, DNAG, are recorded in Canadian Dollars and certain of its international sales are denominated in local currencies, including the Euro, British Pound and Australian Dollar. In 2014, DNAG reported total revenues of U.S. $23.8 million. Our expectation is that the DNAG business will continue to grow and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may be more significant than in past years.\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect DNAG\u2019s revenues and expenses and the translation of DNAG\u2019s financial results into U.S. Dollars. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could negatively affect our consolidated financial statements including our balance sheet, revenues and results of operations. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted.\nChanges in Tax Laws or Their Application Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.\nChanges in tax laws or their application could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes could affect applicable tax rates, utilization of tax loss carryforwards, and treatment of inter-company debt and interest payments.\nWe May Require Future Additional Capital.\nOur future liquidity and ability to meet our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nThe timing and success of the commercial launch of new products;\n\u2022\nThe extent to which we gain or expand market acceptance for existing, new or enhanced products;\n\u2022\nThe costs and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nThe success of our research and product development efforts;\n\u2022\nThe time, cost and degree of success of conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nThe magnitude of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nChanges in existing and potential relationships with distributors and other business partners;\n\u2022\nThe costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, proprietary rights and necessary licenses;\n\u2022\nThe costs and liability associated with patent infringement or other types of litigation;\n\u2022\nCompeting technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nThe scope and timing of strategic acquisitions.\nIf additional financing is needed, we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or other securities or through bank borrowings. There can be no assurance that financing through the sale of securities, bank borrowings or otherwise will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nTerrorist Attacks or Natural Disasters May Adversely Affect Our Business.\nTerrorist attacks or natural disasters, and subsequent governmental responses to these events, could cause economic instability. These actions could adversely affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and reduce demand for our products. These events could disrupt the operations of our customers and suppliers and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers\u2019 ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide raw materials and finished products.\nAlthough we have business interruption insurance, our facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. Various types of disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our manufacturing facilities and computer systems. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur Stock Price Could Continue to be Volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially in the past, may be volatile in the future and could experience substantial declines. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market for our Common Stock:\n\u2022\nFuture announcements concerning us and our products, including with respect to significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nThe performance of our business, including our efforts to increase sales of our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test and molecular collection systems products, and OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test;\n\u2022\nThe successful execution of our strategic arrangements, including our HCV agreement with AbbVie;\n\u2022\nClinical results with respect to our products or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe status of clinical studies and pending submissions for required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nThe announcement of regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies against us, our products or one or more of our customers;\n\u2022\nThe gain or loss of significant contracts and availability of funding for the purchase of our products;\n\u2022\nDelays in the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of new or enhanced products;\n\u2022\nLegislative developments and industry or competitive trends;\n\u2022\nDisputes or developments with key customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nLitigation or threatened litigation;\n\u2022\nComplaints or concerns about the performance or safety of our products and publicity about those issues, including publicity expressed through social media or otherwise over the internet;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders;\n\u2022\nGovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\nChanges in the level of competition;\n\u2022\nLoss of or declines in sales to major distributors or customers or changes in the mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nThe relatively low trading volume for our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nGeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks, civil unrest, war and national disasters.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our Common Stock, as well as the stock of many companies in the diagnostics and life sciences industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nFuture Sales of Our Common Stock by Existing Stockholders, Executive Officers or Directors Could Depress the Market Price of Our Common Stock and Make It More Difficult For Us to Sell Stock in the Future.\nSales of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our Common Stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our Common Stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.\nWe have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our Common Stock. If one or more of these stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers or non-employee members of our Board of Directors could sell shares of our Common Stock during an open trading window or pursuant to a 10b5-1 sales plan under our Insider Trading Policy. These transactions and the perceived reasons for these transactions could have a negative effect on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nInvestor Confidence and Share Value May be Adversely Impacted if We and/or Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Conclude That Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is Not Effective.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring us, as a public company, to include a report in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of these internal controls.\nWe expect that our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business activities change. Although we seek to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the overall quality of our internal controls may be affected by the internal control over financial reporting implemented by any business we acquire and our ability to assess and successfully integrate the internal controls of any such business.\nIf, during any year, our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated, tested or assessed, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then it may issue a report that is qualified. We also could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. These events could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and effectiveness of our internal controls, which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock.\nBecause We Do Not Intend to Pay Cash Dividends on Our Common Stock, an Investor in Our Common Stock Will Benefit Only if it Appreciates in Value.\nWe currently intend to retain our current earnings and future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nCertain Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Under Delaware Law Could Make a Third-Party Acquisition of Us Difficult.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us. These provisions could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.\nFuture Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could Adversely Affect the Trading Price of Our Common Stock and Our Ability to Raise Funds in New Equity Offerings.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our Common Stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Common Stock or the availability of shares of Common Stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 10860, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "OSUR"}
