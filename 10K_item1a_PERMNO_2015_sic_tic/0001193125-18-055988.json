RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in analyzing an investment in our common stock. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that may appear immaterial, also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements, whether made in this report or the other documents we file with the SEC, or our annual or quarterly reports to stockholders, future press releases, or orally, whether in presentations, responses to questions, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to our Business\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the economy and financial markets could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nUncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could lead to a significant decline in demand for the end products manufactured by our customers, which, in turn, could result in a decline in the demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. Any decrease in demand for our products could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the cost and decrease the availability of potential sources of financing and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of other businesses and may encounter risks associated with these activities, which could harm our business and operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect that we will continue to grow by pursuing acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets, or product lines that complement or expand our business. Risks related to an acquisition may include:\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale, or other expected value;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our existing business to focus on integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing production and coordinating operations at new sites;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to retain existing customers of acquired companies when we desire to do so;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential decrease in overall gross margins associated with acquiring a business with a different product mix;\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify certain unrecorded liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to restructure, modify, or terminate customer relationships of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nan increased concentration of business from existing or new customers; and\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to identify assets best suited to our business plan.\nAcquisitions may cause us to:\n\u2022\nenter lines of business and/or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nissue debt and be required to abide by stringent loan covenants;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities; record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation and environmental issues, which include product material content certifications related to conflict minerals;\n\u2022\nincur unanticipated costs;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u2022\nincur substantial transaction-related costs, whether or not a proposed acquisition is consummated.\nAcquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions will be successful. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion. In addition, unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after any such acquisition.\nWe have substantial outstanding indebtedness, and our outstanding indebtedness could adversely impact our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing, our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial debt and, as a result, we have significant debt service obligations. We maintain $250.0 million of Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 at an interest rate of 1.75%, a $349.1 million Term Loan Facility due 2024 (Term Loan Facility) at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%, $375.0 million of Senior Notes due 2025 (Senior Notes) at an interest rate of 5.63%, a $200.0 million U.S. Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement (U.S ABL), and a $150.0 million Asia Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement (Asia ABL). We and a number of our direct and indirect subsidiaries also have various credit facilities and letters of credit. Such agreements also contain certain financial covenants which require us to maintain, under the occurrence of certain events, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.\nIn addition, in conjunction with the pending acquisition of Anaren, we received commitments to fund new $700.0 million secured senior incremental term loan (Incremental Facility). Subsequent to January 1, 2018, we completed the allocation of $600.0 million of commitments from lenders in the syndication for the Incremental Facility, which supersedes the original $700.0 million commitment.\nSubject to the limits contained in the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL, the Asia ABL, the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences to us and our shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments or general corporate purposes, which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\ndiminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business, the industry in which we operate or the economy generally and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or the general economy;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including movements in interest rates, which could result in increased borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt as it could limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures or adverse changes.\nIn addition, the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nWe are required to make scheduled payments on all term loan facilities on a quarterly basis. Based on certain parameters defined in the term loan facilities, including a First Lien Leverage Ratio, we may be required to make an additional principal payment on an annual basis, beginning after fiscal year 2018, if our First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.0.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain regulatory, competitive, financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional capital (which could include obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive) or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL, the indenture governing the Senior Notes will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, we conduct certain of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness may be dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Senior Notes or our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL will limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. For illustrative purposes and assuming all loans under the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL were fully drawn, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $3.3 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility (including the Incremental Facility), the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nWhen issued, our debt will have a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the Senior Notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the Senior Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Senior Notes.\nAny future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRecently enacted changes in tax law could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the \u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d). We are in the process of determining the impact to our financial statements of all aspects of U.S. Tax Reform and intend to reflect the impact of such reform in the financial statements during the period in which such amounts can be reasonably estimated. The U.S. Tax Reform includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction, such as the repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities. The U.S. Tax Reform also includes international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-\nstyle system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations. Financial statement impacts could include adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities) and the accrual for deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the details of the U.S. Tax Reform. The intended and unintended consequences of the U.S. Tax Reform on our business are not yet widely understood and, due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, the changes to the taxation of our activities effected by the U.S. Tax Reform could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe rely on the cellular phone and mobile technology industry for a significant portion of sales. The economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.\nA large percentage of our business is conducted with customers who are in the cellular phone and mobile technology industry. This industry is characterized by intense competition, short product life cycles, seasonality, particularly around the year-end holiday season, and significant fluctuations in consumer demand. This industry is heavily dependent on consumers and therefore can be affected by their demand patterns. If the volatility in this industry continues, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to manufacture products that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. We expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis. For example, in 2018 we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our HDI, mSAP, and other advanced manufacturing capabilities. We may not be able to obtain access to additional sources of funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors. In addition, failure to adopt and implement technological improvements quickly may cause inefficiencies as our product yields or quality may decrease, resulting in increased costs.\nIn addition, the PCB industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive, the development, acquisition, and implementation of those technologies and equipment will require us to make significant capital investments.\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reduce our gross margins.\nTo manufacture PCBs, we use raw materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass, copper foil, chemical solutions, gold, and other commodity products, which we order from our suppliers. In the case of backplane assemblies, components include connectors, sheet metal, capacitors, resistors and diodes, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers\u2019 approved vendors. If raw material and component prices increase, it may reduce our gross margins.\nWe are subject to risks of currency fluctuations.\nA portion of our cash and other current assets is held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the value of these assets as translated to U.S. dollars on our balance sheet. To the extent that we ultimately decide to repatriate some portion of these funds to the United States, the actual value transferred could be impacted by movements in exchange rates. Any such type of movement could negatively impact the amount of cash available to fund operations or to repay debt.\nTo the extent that we may have outstanding receivables or indebtedness denominated in the U.S. dollar or in the Hong Kong dollar (HKD), the fluctuation of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) against the U.S. dollar or the HKD may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations (including the cost of servicing, and the value on our balance sheet of, the U.S. dollar and HKD-denominated indebtedness). Additionally, we have revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the RMB). Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the RMB could result in increases or decreases in our costs or revenues which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Significant inflation or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. For the year ended January 1, 2018, our consolidated statement of operations included a foreign exchange loss of approximately $22.8 million due primarily to the appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and the HKD. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the RMB and the U.S. dollar and the HKD cannot be predicted. Further, China\u2019s government imposes controls over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies, which subjects us to further currency exchange risk.\nProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us.\nWe manufacture products to our customers\u2019 specifications, which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures, despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, manufacturing, or materials failure or error, may result in delayed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders, or liability claims against us. If these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may be impaired. Since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers\u2019 businesses, errors, defects, or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the PCB, for which we may be liable. Although our invoices and sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions. In addition, we manufacture products for a range of automotive customers. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of such products. As suppliers become more integral to the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. In addition, vehicle manufacturers, which have traditionally borne the costs associated with warranty programs offered on their vehicles, are increasingly requiring suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of the costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied by us to the vehicle manufacturer.\nWe depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our sales. Our five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 37%, 33% and 37% of our net sales for the years ended January 1, 2018, January 2, 2017 and December 28, 2015, respectively, and one customer represented 20% of our sales for the year ended January 1, 2018. Sales attributed to OEMs include both direct sales as well as sales that the OEMs place through EMS providers. Our customer concentration could fluctuate, depending on future customer requirements, which will depend in large part on market conditions in the electronics industry segments in which our customers participate. The loss of one or more significant customers or a decline in sales to our significant customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, during industry downturns, we may need to reduce prices to limit the level of order losses, and we may be unable to collect payments from our customers. There can be no assurance that key customers would\nnot cancel orders, that they would continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as experienced by us in prior periods, that they would be able to meet their payment obligations, or that the end-products that use our products would be successful. This concentration of customer base may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations due to the loss or cancellation of business from any of these key customers, significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers, or decreases in the prices of the products sold to any of these customers.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins will continue to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization will depend on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve expected gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived assets change in the future, significant impairment charges could result that would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our quick turnaround production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance, other exit costs, and asset impairments, as well as potentially causing disruptions in our ability to supply customers.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the worldwide electronics industry, which is characterized by economic cycles and fluctuations in product demand. A downturn in the electronics industry or prolonged global economic crisis could result in decreased demand for our manufacturing services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from the electronics industry, which is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. The industry is subject to economic cycles and recessionary periods. Due to the uncertainty in the end markets served by most of our customers, we have a low level of visibility with respect to future financial results. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings, and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings, and cash flows.\nWe participate in the competitive, cyclical automotive industry, which is subject to strict quality control standards. Failure to meet quality standards may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has historically experienced multi-year cycles of growth and decline. In recent years, we have witnessed a growth cycle. If sales of automobiles should decline or go into a cyclical down turn, our sales could decline and this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nIn addition, for safety reasons, automotive customers have strict quality standards that generally exceed the quality requirements of other customers. If such products do not meet these quality standards, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These automotive customers may require long periods of time to evaluate whether our manufacturing processes and facilities meet their quality standards. If we were to lose automotive customers due to quality control issues, we might not be able to regain those customers or gain new automotive customers for long periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required under our contracts with automotive industry customers to indemnify them for the cost of warranties and recalls relating to our products.\nOur results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to rising labor costs, particularly within China, where we have most of our manufacturing facilities. In recent periods there have been regular and significant increases in the minimum wage payable in various provinces of China. In addition, we have experienced very high employee turnover in our manufacturing facilities in China, generally after the Chinese New Year, and we are experiencing ongoing difficulty in recruiting employees for these facilities. Furthermore, labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have in the past slowed or stopped production by certain manufacturers in China. In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the high turnover rate and our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and the other labor trends we are noting in China could result in a potential for defects in our products, production disruptions or delays, or the inability to ramp production to meet increased customer orders, resulting in order cancellation or imposition of customer penalties if we are unable to deliver products in a timely manner.\nTo respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally in lower-cost locations. If we pursue such expansions, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support PCB manufacturing. We cannot assure investors that we will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations will contribute positively to our operating results.\nIn our North America operations, rising labor and health care costs pose a significant risk. We work with our insurance brokers and carriers to control the cost of health care for our employees. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed, especially given recent and pending changes in government oversight of health care.\nOur results of operations are often subject to demand fluctuations and seasonality. With a high level of fixed operating costs, even small revenue shortfalls would decrease our gross margins.\nOur results of operations fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of orders from and shipments to major customers;\n\u2022\nthe levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of revenues generated from quick-turn versus standard delivery time services;\n\u2022\nexpenditures, charges or write-offs, including those related to acquisitions, facility restructurings, or asset impairments; and\n\u2022\nexpenses relating to expanding existing manufacturing facilities.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins. In addition, we have experienced sales fluctuations due to seasonal patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles, as well as inventory management practices of our customers and the end markets we serve. In particular, the seasonality of the cellular phone and tablet industries and quick-turn ordering patterns affect the overall PCB industry. These seasonal trends have caused fluctuations in our operating results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nWe rely on the telecommunication industry for a significant portion of sales. The economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.\nA large percentage of our business is conducted with customers who are in the telecommunication industry. This industry is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. This industry is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of those markets. If the volatility in this industry continues, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be materially adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries and states with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors. Our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities, and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our net earnings do not remain at or above recent levels, or we are not able to predict with a reasonable degree of probability that they will continue, we may have to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets.\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries have deferred income tax assets. Based on our forecast for future taxable earnings for these foreign subsidiaries, we believe we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods. However, if our estimates of future earnings decline, we may have to increase our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, resulting in a higher income tax provision, which would reduce our results of operations.\nIssues arising during the upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system could affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, management system to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. We are investing significant financial and personnel resources into this project. However, there is no assurance that the system upgrade will meet our current or future business needs or that it will operate as designed. The transition to the new ERP system will affect numerous systems necessary for our operation. If we fail to correctly implement one or more components of the ERP system, we could experience significant disruption to our operations. Such disruptions could include, among other things, temporary loss of data, inability to process certain orders, failure of systems to communicate with each other and the inability to track or reconcile key data. We are heavily dependent on automated management systems, and any significant failure or delay in the system upgrade could cause a substantial interruption to our business and additional expense, which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we would be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings, which may be material and would also reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs of January 1, 2018, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $475.5 million of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred, such that the\npotential for reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with further decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization may indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that assets are impaired, we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, which could harm our results during the periods in which such a reduction is recognized.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations, and future transfers of shares of our common stock, when aggregated with the November 2016 and February 2017 secondary sales of our shares, could cause us to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d that could further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating losses (NOL\u2019s) to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in a corporation\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.\nA corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change NOLs equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation for a taxable year is generally increased by the amount of any \u201crecognized built-in gains\u201d for such year and the amount of any unused annual limitation in a prior year. As a result of our acquisition of Viasystems, the NOLs acquired were subject to this limitation. In February 2017 and November 2016, 4,000,000 and 13,800,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were sold by Su Sih, our largest shareholder and a \u201c5-percent shareholder.\u201d Additional future transfers or sales of our common stock during the rolling period by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d could cause us to experience an ownership change under Section 382, which could further limit our use of NOLs.\nAdverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to operate our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we have been, and may in the future be subject to employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, minimum wage, overtime pay and other employment related matters. We cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings. Any significant adverse determinations, judgments or settlements could reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, limit our ability to operate our business or harm our reputation.\nEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of engineering and manufacturing personnel. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees, primarily in China, may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages. Any of these events could be disruptive to our operations and could result in negative publicity, loss of contracts, and a decrease in revenues. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees or segments of our workforce become unionized, including any of our employees in the United States. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in a work stoppage since 2013.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets.\nMost of our sales are on an \u201copen credit\u201d basis, with standard industry payment terms. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure\nfor doubtful accounts. During periods of economic downturn in the electronics industry and the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, such programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks.\nAdditionally, our OEM customers often direct a significant portion of their purchases through a relatively limited number of EMS companies. Sales to EMS companies represented approximately 32%, 35% and 35% of our net sales for the years ended January 1, 2018, January 2, 2017 and December 28, 2015, respectively. Our contractual relationship is often with the EMS companies, who are obligated to pay us for our products. Because we expect our OEM customers to continue to direct our sales to EMS companies, we expect to continue to be subject to this credit risk with a limited number of EMS customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on suppliers and equipment manufacturers for the timely delivery of raw materials, components, equipment and spare parts used in manufacturing our PCBs and E-M Solutions. If a raw material supplier or equipment manufacturer goes bankrupt, liquidates, consolidates out of existence or fails to satisfy our product quality standards, it could harm our ability to purchase new manufacturing equipment, service the equipment we have, or timely produce our products, thereby affecting our customer relationships.\nConsolidations and restructuring in our supplier base and equipment fabricators related to our raw materials purchases or the manufacturing equipment we use to fabricate our products may result in adverse changes in pricing of materials due to reduction in competition among our raw material suppliers or an elimination or shortage of equipment and spare parts from our manufacturing equipment supply base. Suppliers and equipment manufacturers may be impacted by other events outside our control including macro-economic, financial instability, environmental occurrences, or supplier interruptions due to fire, natural catastrophes or otherwise. Suppliers and equipment manufacturers may extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, which could harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis and negatively impact our financial results. In addition, in extreme circumstances, the suppliers we purchase from could cease production due to a fire, natural disaster, consolidation or liquidation of their businesses. As such, this may impact our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis and harm our customer relationships and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe serve customers and have manufacturing facilities outside the United States and are subject to the risks characteristic of international operations.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations in Asia and Canada and sales offices located in Asia and Europe, and we continue to consider additional opportunities to make foreign investments and construct new foreign facilities.\nFor the year ended January 1, 2018, we generated approximately 73.2% of our net sales from non-U.S. operations, and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by international suppliers during this period. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to significant international operations, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanaging international operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nunstable regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ncompliance with employment laws;\n\u2022\nimplementation of disclosure controls, internal controls, financial reporting systems, and governance standards to comply with U.S. accounting and securities laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on imports or exports of our product offerings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of local currencies;\n\u2022\ninflation or changes in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest, rising wages, difficulties in staffing, and geographical labor shortages;\n\u2022\ngovernment or political unrest;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nlanguage and communication barriers, as well as time zone differences;\n\u2022\ncultural differences;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties and taxation levied on our products;\n\u2022\nother potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ntravel restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of private enterprises;\n\u2022\nthe potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment and trade; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for strained trade relationships between the United States and its trading partners.\nOur operations in China subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China.\nUnder its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. No assurance can be given, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successful if pursued, or that such policies will not be significantly altered from time to time. Despite progress in developing its legal system, China does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws, particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade. Enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent. As the Chinese legal system develops, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws, and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. Further, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. In addition, though changes in government policies and rules are timely published or communicated, there is usually no indication of the duration of any grace period before which full implementation and compliance will be required. As a result, we may operate our business in violation of new rules and policies before full compliance can be achieved. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our business, which involves unique risks. Changes in government defense spending or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from products and services that are ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our OEM and EMS customers and is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal government budget process. We are a supplier, primarily as a subcontractor, to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. The contracts between our direct customers and the government end user are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks, such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.\nFor the year ended January 1, 2018, aerospace and defense sales accounted for approximately 16% of our total net sales. The substantial majority of aerospace and defense sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. While we do not sell any significant volume of products directly to the U.S.\ngovernment, we are a supplier to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. Consequently, our sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments and may be affected by federal budget sequestration measures.\nThe domestic and international threat of terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states, and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions in the recent past. The U.S. government, however, is facing unprecedented budgeting constraints. The termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture changes to the U.S. Munitions List could reduce or eliminate restrictions that currently apply to some of the products we produce. If these regulations or others are changed in a manner that reduces restrictions on products being manufactured overseas, we would likely face an increase in the number of competitors and increased price competition from overseas manufacturers, who are restricted by the current export laws from manufacturing products for U.S. defense systems.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. government.\nA facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the Department of Defense and certain other agencies of the U.S. government. As a cleared entity, we must comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations. Further, due to the fact that a significant portion of our voting equity is owned by a non-U.S. entity, we are required to be governed by and operate in accordance with the terms and requirements of the Special Security Agreement (SSA). The terms of the SSA have been previously disclosed in our SEC filings.\nIf we were to violate the terms and requirements of the SSA, the NISPOM, or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations (which may apply to us under the terms of classified contracts), we could lose our security clearance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform on classified contracts and would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in litigation, fines, revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes, or debarment from our participation in federal government contracts.\nOur operations are regulated under a number of domestic and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, recycling, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, as well as analogous state, local, and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous. Because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes, we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites, or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated. Even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, we may still be liable. The wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal and cupric etching solutions, metal stripping solutions, waste acid solutions, waste alkaline cleaners, waste oil, and waste waters that contain heavy metals such as copper, tin, lead, nickel, gold, silver, cyanide, and fluoride, and both filter cake and spent ion exchange resins from equipment used for on-site waste treatment.\nEnvironmental law violations, including the failure to maintain required environmental permits, could subject us to fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including the revocation of our effluent discharge permits. This\ncould require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail, environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend.\nEnvironmental laws have generally become more stringent and we expect this trend to continue over time, especially in developing countries, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations, and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation to another global location where prohibitive regulations do not exist. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly required to certify compliance with various material content restrictions in our products based on laws of various jurisdictions or territories such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, or REACH directives in the European Union and China\u2019s RoHS legislation. Similar laws have been adopted in other jurisdictions and may become increasingly prevalent. In addition, we must also certify as to the non-applicability of the EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive for certain products that we manufacture. The REACH directive requires the identification of Substances of Very High Concern, or SVHCs periodically. We must survey our supply chain and certify to the non-presence or presence of SVHCs to our customers. As with other types of product certifications that we routinely provide, we may incur liability and pay damages if our products do not conform to our certifications.\nWe are also subject to an increasing variety of environmental laws and regulations in China, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The manufacturing of our products generates gaseous chemical wastes, liquid wastes, waste water, and other industrial wastes from various stages of the manufacturing process. Production sites in China are subject to increasing regulation and periodic monitoring by the relevant environmental protection authorities. Environmental claims or the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production, or cessation of operations.\nThe process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to domestic and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, recycling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes, and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to Chinese environmental waste water law was issued in late 2012, allowing for an interim period in which plants subject to such law may install equipment that meet the new regulatory regime. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the newly adopted environmental regulations. We have developed plans to these new regulations and we are in the process of implementing these plans. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we could lose market share if we are unable to maintain our current competitive position in end markets using our quick-turn, high technology, and high-mix manufacturing services.\nThe PCB industry is intensely competitive, highly fragmented, and rapidly changing. We expect competition to continue, which could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT & S Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik AG, Chin Poon Industrial Co., LTD., Compeq Manufacturing Co., Ltd., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Multek Corporation, Sanmina Corporation, Tripod Technology Corp., Unimicron Technology Corp., and Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. Our principal E-M Solutions competitors include Amphenol Corp, Flex, Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation. In addition, we increasingly compete on an international basis, and new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our markets.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and manufacturing resources that can be devoted to the development, production, and sale of their products;\n\u2022\nmore established and broader sales and marketing channels;\n\u2022\nmore manufacturing facilities worldwide, some of which are closer in proximity to OEMs;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing facilities that are located in countries with lower production costs;\n\u2022\nlower capacity utilization, which in peak market conditions can result in shorter lead times to customers;\n\u2022\nability to add additional capacity faster or more efficiently;\n\u2022\npreferred vendor status with existing and potential customers;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition; and\n\u2022\nlarger customer bases.\nIn addition, these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements than we do. We must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers\u2019 needs for complex products, and our manufacturing process technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. During recessionary periods in the electronics industry, our strategy of providing quick-turn services, an integrated manufacturing solution, and responsive customer service may take on reduced importance to our customers. As a result, we may need to compete more on the basis of price, which would cause our gross margins to decline.\nIf we are unable to provide our customers with high-end technology, high-quality products, and responsive service, or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain our existing customer base and obtain business from new customers, we must demonstrate our ability to produce our products at the level of technology, quality, responsiveness of service, timeliness of delivery, and cost that our customers require. If our products are of substandard quality, if they are not delivered on time, if we are not responsive to our customers\u2019 demands, or if we cannot meet our customers\u2019 technological requirements, our reputation as a reliable supplier of our products would likely be damaged. If we are unable to meet anticipated product and service standards, we may be unable to obtain new contracts or keep our existing customers, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks for the use of certain metals from \u201cconflict minerals\u201d originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries. While these new rules continue to be the subject of ongoing litigation and, as a result, uncertainty, we submitted a conflict minerals report on Form SD with the SEC for the past four years, most recently on May 30, 2017. Compliance with these rules results in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the costs and expenses of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our PCBs, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may, at a minimum, face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.\nOutages, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events could disrupt our operations, and breaches of our security systems may cause us to incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to collect, process, transmit, and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing, and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, hacking, terrorist attacks, and similar events. . In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, our proprietary and confidential business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees. The secure collection, processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, cyber attacks, attacks by hackers or breached due to employee or third party (including suppliers and business partners) error, malfeasance or other disruptions. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, altered, lost, or stolen during transmission, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, loss of customers, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDamage to our manufacturing facilities due to fire, natural disaster, or other events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe destruction or closure of any of our facilities for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, blizzard, act of war or terrorism, flood, tornado, earthquake, lightning, other natural disasters, an outbreak of epidemics such as Ebola or severe acute respiratory syndrome, required maintenance, or other events could harm us financially, increasing our costs of doing business and limiting our ability to deliver our manufacturing services on a timely basis.\nOur insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers\u2019 products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIn the event one or more of our facilities is closed on a temporary or permanent basis as a result of a natural disaster, required maintenance or other event, or in the event that an outbreak of a serious epidemic results in quarantines, temporary closures of offices or manufacturing facilities, travel restrictions or the temporary or permanent loss of key personnel, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame could be lengthy and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have disaster recovery plans in place, there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man-made disaster, pandemic, required repair or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier.\nWe face constant pricing pressure from our customers and competitors, which may decrease our profit margins.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. We and some of our competitors have reduced average selling prices in the past. In addition, competitors may reduce their average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs, which can also accelerate the rate of decline of our selling prices. When prices decline, we may also be required to write down the value of our inventory.\nThe effects of such pricing pressures on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs of supply. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, this in turn reduces gross profit if we are unable to raise prices. Further, uncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could also lead to a significant decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent global economic downturn, many businesses have taken a more conservative stance in ordering inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products, coupled with pressure from the market and our customers to decrease our prices, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe pricing pressure we face on our products requires us to introduce new and more advanced technology products to maintain average selling prices or reduce any declines in average selling prices. As we shift production to more advanced, higher-density PCBs, we tend to make significant investments in plants and other capital equipment and incur higher costs of production, which may not be recovered.\nThe prominence of EMS companies as our customers could reduce our gross margins, potential sales, and customers.\nSales to EMS companies represented approximately 32%, 35% and 35% of our net sales for the years ended January 1, 2018, January 2, 2017 and December 28, 2015, respectively. Sales to EMS providers include sales directed by OEMs as well as orders placed with us at the EMS providers\u2019 discretion. EMS providers source on a global basis to a greater extent than OEMs. The growth of EMS providers increases the purchasing power of such providers and has in the past, and could in the future, result in increased price competition or the loss of existing OEM customers. In addition, some EMS providers, including some of our customers, have the ability to directly manufacture PCBs and create backplane assemblies. If a significant number of our other EMS customers were to acquire these abilities, our customer base might shrink, and our sales might decline substantially. Moreover, if any of our OEM customers outsource the production of PCBs and creation of backplane assemblies to these EMS providers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in the scope and complexity of our operations. This growth may strain our managerial, financial, manufacturing, and other resources. In order to manage our growth, we may be required to continue to implement additional operating and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations. In addition, growth in our capacity could result in reduced capacity utilization and a corresponding decrease in gross margins.\nOur international sales are subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt practices, trade, and export controls and economic sanctions. Any non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate on a global basis and are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and sell our products in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We also, from time to time, undertake business ventures with state-owned companies or enterprises.\nOur global business operations must also comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR), and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Some items we manufacture are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security under EAR.\nWe train our employees concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and compliance with international regulations regarding trades and exports, and we have policies in place that prohibit employees from making improper payments. We cannot provide assurances that our internal controls and procedures will guarantee compliance by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-kickback laws in international jurisdictions or for violations of ITAR, EAR, or other similar regulations regarding trades and exports, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the inadvertence of others, we could suffer criminal or civil fines or penalties or other repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur global business operations also must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations, such as laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including criminal or civil fines or penalties, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business.\nIn certain countries, we may engage third-party agents or intermediaries, such as customs agents, to act on our behalf, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in criminal or civil fines or penalties or other sanctions being assessed against us. We take certain measures designed to ensure our compliance with U.S. export and economic sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws and regulations, and export control laws. However, it is possible that some of our products were sold or will be sold to distributors or other parties, without our knowledge or consent, in violation of applicable law. There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance in the future. Any such violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines, penalties, or other sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEmployee theft or fraud could result in loss.\nCertain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets, which could expose us to fraud or theft. In addition, certain employees have access to certain precious metals used in connection with our manufacturing and key information technology infrastructure and to customer and other information that is commercially valuable. Should any employee, for any reason, steal any such precious metals (which has occurred from time to time), compromise our information technology systems, or misappropriate customer or other information, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers against us, and the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged. Additionally, in the case of our defense business, we could be barred from future participation in government programs. Any such losses may not be fully covered by insurance.\nBecause we sell on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers that could decrease revenues and harm our operating results.\nAlthough we have long-term contracts with many customers, those contracts generally do not contain volume commitments. We generally sell to customers on a purchase order basis. Our quick-turn orders are subject to particularly short lead times. Consequently, our sales are subject to short-term variability in demand by our customers. Customers submitting purchase orders may cancel, reduce, or delay their orders for a variety of reasons, subject to negotiations. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers may vary due to:\n\u2022\ncustomer attempts to manage inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 manufacturing strategies, such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of PCB manufacturers or backplane assembly service providers used or to manufacture or assemble its own products internally;\n\u2022\nvariation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nchanges in new product introductions.\nWe have periodically experienced terminations, reductions, and delays in our customers\u2019 orders. Further terminations, reductions, or delays in our customers\u2019 orders could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them that have restrictive terms and conditions. These agreements typically include provisions that increase our financial exposure, which could result in significant costs to us.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them. These agreements typically do not include volume commitments, but do include provisions that generally serve to increase our exposure for product liability and limited sales returns, which could result in higher costs to us as a result of such claims. In addition, these agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our operational and pricing flexibility and extend payment terms, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their PCB manufacturing and backplane assembly needs to us. If OEMs choose to provide these services in-house or select other providers, our business could suffer.\nOur future revenue growth partially depends on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other providers, our financial results and future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nConsolidation among our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecently, some of our large customers have consolidated, and further consolidation of customers may occur. Depending on which organization becomes the controller of the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, there does exist the potential for decreased revenue if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. We also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund investments in our operations, refinance our indebtedness, and to maintain and grow our business, and such capital may not be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur business is capital-intensive, and our ability to increase revenue, profit, and cash flow depends upon continued capital spending. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings. If we are unable to fund our operations and make capital expenditures as currently planned or if we do not have sufficient liquidity to service the interest and principal payments on our debt, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we do not achieve our expected operating results, we would need to reallocate our sources and uses of operating cash flows. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including the following:\n\u2022\nto fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity, upgrade and expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment or introduce new products;\n\u2022\nto refinance our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nto fund our operations beyond 2018;\n\u2022\nto fund working capital requirements for future growth that we may experience;\n\u2022\nto enhance or expand the range of services we offer;\n\u2022\nto increase our sales and marketing activities; or\n\u2022\nto respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition, and international expansion activities.\nShould we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. There can be no assurance that additional capital, including any future equity or debt financing, would be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. If such funds are not available to us when required or on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations could be materially adversely affected by a shortage of utilities or a discontinuation of priority supply status offered for such utilities.\nThe manufacturing of PCBs requires significant quantities of electricity and water. Our operations in Asia have historically purchased substantially all of the electrical power for their manufacturing plants in China from local power plants. Because China\u2019s economy has recently been in a state of growth, the strain on the nation\u2019s power plants is increasing, which has led to continuing power outages in various parts of the country. There may be times when our operations in China may be unable to obtain adequate sources of electricity to meet production requirements. Various regions in China have in the past experienced shortages of both electricity and water and unexpected interruptions of power supply. From time to time, the Chinese government rations electrical power, which can lead to unscheduled production interruptions at our manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, certain areas in which our North America operations have manufacturing facilities, particularly in California, have experienced power and resource shortages from time to time, including mandatory periods without electrical power, changes to water availability, and significant increases in utility and resource costs.\nWe do not generally maintain any back-up power generation facilities or reserves of water for our operations, so if we were to lose supplies of power or water at any of our facilities, we would be required to cease operations until such supply was restored. Any resulting cessation of operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, thus potentially resulting in a loss of business, along with increased costs of manufacturing, and under-utilization of capacity. In addition, the sudden cessation of our power or water supply could damage our equipment, resulting in the need for costly repairs or maintenance, as well as damage to products in production, resulting in an increase in scrapped products.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel, and the loss of any of our key executive officers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated, and qualified managerial and professional personnel. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future. We can make no assurances that future changes in executive management will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our business also depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified employees, particularly engineering and sales and marketing personnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Further, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on the collective industry experience of our employees. If a significant number of these employees were to leave us, it could limit our ability to compete effectively and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry. Although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees, if a significant number of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment, and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience, our manufacturing processes might suffer as we might be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry. As a result, we may lose our ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, we have experienced a significant amount of employee attrition in our China operations each year, which has negatively impacted our yield, costs of production, and service times.\nInfringement of our intellectual property rights could negatively affect us, and we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties that could be costly to defend, could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and if successful, could result in liability.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary and confidential information. All of these measures afford only limited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented, breached, or challenged, and others may develop intellectual property, technologies or processes that are similar, or superior to, our intellectual property or technology. We may not have adequate controls and procedures in place to protect our proprietary and confidential information. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, and succeed in, copying, our products or may obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary or confidential. If it becomes necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly, and distracting to management, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information. Failure to successfully establish or enforce our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. As is the case with many other companies in the PCB industry, we from time to time receive communications from third parties asserting patent rights over our products and enter into discussions with such third parties. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement. If any claims, whether or not they have merit, are brought against our customers for such infringement, we could be required to expend significant resources in defending such claims. In the event we are subject to any infringement claims, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or in obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms, or at all, and may be required to modify or cease marketing our products or services, which could disrupt the production processes, damage our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change initiatives.\nOur manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy sources and supply choices, as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials that are derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Anaren (Acquisition)\nThe Acquisition is subject to closing conditions. Failure to complete the Acquisition could have material and adverse effects on TTM.\nOn December 1, 2017, TTM entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement in connection with the Acquisition. Although we currently expect the Acquisition to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be completed in accordance with the anticipating timing or at all. In addition, if the Acquisition has not been completed by June 1, 2018 (subject to extension to September 1, 2018 in certain circumstances), either Anaren or TTM may terminate the Purchase Agreement unless the failure of the Acquisition to be completed has resulted from certain failures of the party seeking to terminate the Purchase Agreement to perform its obligations there under. In conjunction with the pending Acquisition, we have received commitments to fund a $700.0 million Incremental Facility. Subsequent to January 1, 2018, we completed the allocation of $600.0 million of commitments from lenders in the syndication for the Incremental Facility, which supercedes the original $700.0 million commitment. TTM expects to pay $600.0 million of the purchase price for the Acquisition with proceeds of the Incremental Facility. If the Incremental Facility is not funded for any reason, TTM may be unable to complete the Acquisition.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, TTM\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected. Additionally, in the event the Acquisition is not completed, TTM will be subject to a number of risks without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Acquisition, including the following:\n\u2022\nTTM will be required to pay its costs relating to the Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, financing and financial advisory fees, whether or not the Acquisition is completed, and could be required to pay Anaren a termination fee of $31.0 million in cash if the Purchase Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which certain required regulatory approvals are not obtained prior to June 1, 2018 or September 1, 2018, as applicable;\n\u2022\nin circumstances where the termination fee is not the specified remedy for a failure by TTM to complete the acquisition in accordance with its obligations, TTM may be subject to claims for damages or specific performance;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by management to matters relating to the Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of TTM\u2019s securities could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Acquisition will be completed, or to the extent that the Acquisition is fundamental to TTM\u2019s business strategy.\nThe integration of Anaren may present significant challenges to TTM, and although TTM expects the Acquisition will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits to TTM, TTM may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the realization of synergies, and other challenges.\nTTM and Anaren have operated and, until consummation of the Acquisition, will continue to operate independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key TTM or Anaren employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or other unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues and potential risks, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of TTM and Anaren in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the combined company performs as expected:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement the business plan for the combined company;\n\u2022\ncombining the businesses of TTM and Anaren and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings or revenue synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nsatisfying the requirements of our customers and meeting their expectations while we integrate operations;\n\u2022\nintegration of the contracting activities of TTM and Anaren, particularly with respect to the companies\u2019 respective military and government contracts;\n\u2022\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and other policies, procedures, and processes;\n\u2022\ncosts, including legal and settlement costs, associated with TTM\u2019s and Anaren\u2019s legal proceedings, and other costs, including legal and settlement costs, associated with the combined company\u2019s other loss contingencies, in each case whether known or unknown and whether relating to past, present or future facts, events, circumstances, or occurrences, any of which could be materially adverse to the business, results of operations, assets, or financial condition of TTM or Anaren and, following the Acquisition, the financial position, results of operations, and liquidity of the combined company and the ability of the combined company to achieve expected benefits of the Acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential deterioration in the financial performance of TTM and Anaren, including any potential deviation in results of operations from historical levels;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the retention and assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in the size of our company after the Acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of divestiture requirements or a required exit from business lines to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and risks in the integration of departments and systems (including accounting, health information and management information systems), technologies (including software), books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls (including internal control over financial reporting and related procedures and policies); and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated issues, expenses, or liabilities that could materially adversely affect our ability to realize any expected synergies on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf we cannot successfully integrate Anaren, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Successful integration of TTM and Anaren will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to realize opportunities for revenue growth and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of difficulties in combining the two companies, we may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Acquisition.\nThe Acquisition may be consummated on different terms from those contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement.\nPrior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties may, by their mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, including with respect to any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties\u2019 respective operations during the pendency thereof. Any such amendments or alterations may have negative consequences, including reducing the cash available for TTM\u2019s or Anaren\u2019s operations or to meet respective obligations or restricting or limiting assets or operations of either of TTM or Anaren.\nEfforts may be made by various parties to rescind the Acquisition, place restrictions on the business of the combined company, or require divestitures to gain the approval of regulatory authorities with respect to the Acquisition.\nThe consummation of the Acquisition is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) waiting period and the receipt of certain other approvals, including approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) and the Defense Security Service. We received early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act on December 22, 2017. As of the date of this report, we have not yet received the necessary approval from CFIUS.\nNotwithstanding the expiration of the statutory waiting periods or an extension thereto and receipt of clearance of the Acquisition from the applicable regulatory authorities, at any time after consummation of the Acquisition the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), or any state or foreign regulatory authority, could take action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to rescind the Acquisition or the divestiture of shares purchased or particular assets held by the combined company, in addition to other restrictions. Moreover, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging the Acquisition after it has been consummated. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Acquisition on antitrust grounds after the consummation of the Acquisition will not be made or, if this challenge is made, what the result will be.\nIf the challenging party is successful, the Acquisition may be rescinded or we may be subject to requirements, limitations or costs, required to make divestitures or have restrictions placed on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. If we agree to any material requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect our ability to integrate Anaren\u2019s operations with TTM\u2019s operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. This could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, while the Acquisition is conditioned on the satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements, it is not conditioned on the absence of any changes to the business of TTM, Anaren, and the combined company that may be necessitated by such regulatory authorities to obtain approvals. As a result of the foregoing, the financial profile of the combined company may be different in a material manner than the historical financial presentations of TTM and Anaren and the pro forma balance sheet and statements of operations data included in this offering memorandum.", "PERMNO": 88648, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "TTMI"}
