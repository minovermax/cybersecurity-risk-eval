{"cik": "1201663", "company": "AUDIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. The following risks and uncertainties may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. You should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks or uncertainties we face were to occur, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe depend on Samsung for the majority of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, Samsung would adversely affect our revenue and significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFor 2014 and 2013, Samsung accounted for 75% and 63% of our total revenue, respectively, and we anticipate that Samsung will continue to represent a majority of our revenue at least through the end of 2015. Samsung may purchase fewer of our voice and audio processors than it did in the past, alter its purchasing patterns, modify the terms on which it purchases our products, or decide not to purchase our products at all. In addition, our revenue is dependent upon consumer acceptance of and demand for Samsung\u2019s high-end smart phones, in which our products are incorporated. Samsung announced in July 2014 that it expected demand for its high-end smart phones to be weak in the third quarter of 2014 and later announced in October 2014 that its third quarter earnings decreased substantially as a result of declining phone sales due to increased smart phone competition. If Samsung continues to experience declining sales of its smart phones which include our processors, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be significantly harmed. We generally operate under purchase orders from Samsung and do not have a master supply agreement with this OEM. We renegotiate prices with Samsung periodically and our revenue and gross margins may fluctuate as a result. Samsung is not obligated to continue to purchase processors from us. Samsung may seek second sources or decide to replace our processors with other hardware, software or lower cost solutions. If we fail to achieve design wins for global platforms at Samsung, our future revenue and profitability may be harmed.\nWe depend on a small number of OEMs for a substantial majority of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our OEMs could adversely affect our revenue and significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales to a small number of OEMs. For 2014, Samsung and Comtech, a distributor that sells our products to end customers, such as Xiaomi, accounted for 75% and 11% of our total revenues. We expect this concentration in a small number of OEMs and distributors to continue during 2015. We may be unable to secure future design wins from these OEMs as they develop and introduce new products and, even if we do, existing OEM product sales may decline and new mobile devices introduced by our current OEMs may not achieve widespread market acceptance or be produced in large number. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our revenue from our existing OEMs. For example, we expect our licensing revenue on royalty payments from Apple to substantially decline as this OEM phases out older generations of mobile phones in which our processor IP had been included.\nOur OEMs typically buy our processors on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term contracts or minimum purchase commitments that would obligate them to continue to buy additional processors from us in the future. For example, we announced in August 2013, July 2014 and October 2014 that weakness in demand for certain high-end smart phones was anticipated to cause a decline in the volume of processors purchased from us by our largest OEM and as a result, we had excess inventory for which we recorded reserves.\nAlthough we seek to grow our OEM base through new design wins, our sales and development cycle to obtain initial design wins from new OEMs is long and is subject to uncertainties, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so. Even if we are successful in obtaining design wins with new OEMs, our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nexisting OEM customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the future. Although an OEM may design us into a particular device, we endeavor to win design slots in other devices, including the next generation devices and may not be able to do so. Because the commercial life of smart phones is relatively limited, we have limited ability to predict whether a given OEM will continue to use our processors. If we are unable to generate repeat business from our existing OEMs, generate revenue from new OEMs or expand into broader markets, our operating results would be adversely affected. If one or more of our existing OEMs were to decide not to use our processors or processor IP, that decision could harm our brand and impair our ability to maintain or extend our relationships with our other OEMs or establish new OEM relationships. In addition, if concentration in the mobile phone industry or the smartphone market segment increases, we may be unable to diversify our revenue base, which could significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nDecreased purchases by large OEM customers, whether for current or future mobile device models in which our products were included or otherwise, changes in their purchasing patterns, modification of terms or a disruption or termination of our relationships with these OEMs could adversely affect our revenue and significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. For example, due to weakness in demand for certain high-end smart phones we experienced a significant decline in the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014. Decreased purchases by large OEM customers could also cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations because we have significant fixed expenses in the short term and may not be able to reduce expenses in a timely manner to offset such a short-fall. In addition, our sales and development cycle to obtain new design wins and new OEMs is long.\nAlthough we are reliant on a small number of OEMs for our revenue in any period, the identity of those OEMs may change depending on the timing of their mobile device releases, seasonal user purchasing patterns and launch dates set by MNOs. We expect our operating results for the foreseeable future to depend on sales to a small number of OEMs and on the ability of these OEMs to sell mobile devices that incorporate our products and/or technology. Our revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our sales are dependent upon the timing of OEMs\u2019 design cycles and product introductions. Substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our OEMs to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and may make our revenue volatile from period to period. Our OEMs are generally not obligated to purchase from us and may purchase voice and audio solutions from our competitors.\nWe typically work with OEMs to obtain design wins prior to the OEM entering into an agreement with an MNO to produce a given mobile device. However, even if the design win is awarded, the OEM or MNO may cancel a given mobile device launch. Although it would be time consuming for an OEM to design our products out of mobile devices currently in production, an OEM may seek to do so or to establish a second source. Even if our products offer superior sound quality, OEMs may elect to divide their purchases among two or more companies that supply voice and audio solutions to avoid becoming reliant on a single supplier and due to the perception that having multiple suppliers will enable the OEM to secure more favorable pricing. OEMs may decline to design in our products if one or more of the features of our products do not perform as well as those offered by other suppliers, despite our other features\u2019 superior performance. We do not have agreements with our OEMs requiring them to incorporate our processors in future mobile devices. Our OEMs are not obligated to complete the development or begin commercial shipment of any devices that incorporate our processors.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from the high-end smart phone market, and reductions in the growth rate of this market segment could adversely affect our revenue and significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nMuch of our revenue comes from sales to OEMs incorporating our products in high-end smart phones. Even if our products continue to be incorporated in these and similar high-end smart phone models, shipment volumes of our products may decrease because of reduced demand for high-end smart phones due to either user or MNO preference for less expensive smart phone models, or due to saturation of demand among users. If demand for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nhigh-end mobile devices were to decline or fail to continue to grow in a manner consistent with expectations, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent on sales of mobile devices that incorporate our processors and software, and a decline in the demand for these mobile devices could harm our business.\nSince inception, our revenue has been generated from the sale of processors and processor IP for mobile devices. Continued market adoption of mobile device sound quality solutions, as well as motion sensor and voice quality software, is critical to our future success. Our success is also dependent on our OEMs\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize their mobile devices in which our solutions are incorporated. The markets for our OEMs\u2019 mobile devices are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. These changes result in frequent product introductions, short product life cycles and increased device convergence and capabilities. Mobile devices incorporating our solutions may not achieve market success or may become obsolete. We cannot assure you that our OEMs will dedicate the resources necessary to promote and commercialize mobile devices incorporating our solutions, successfully execute their business strategies for these mobile devices, be able to manufacture quantities sufficient to meet demand or cost effectively manufacture mobile devices at high volume. Any of these factors, as well as more general mobile device industry issues, could result in a decline in sales of mobile devices that incorporate our products. If demand for our products or our OEMs\u2019 mobile devices were to decline, fail to continue to grow at all or in a manner consistent with expectations, our revenue would decline and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to diversify end user devices that incorporate our products and may not realize substantial revenue from sales of our products for devices other than high-end smart phones.\nWe have made efforts to diversify the end user devices that incorporate our products. As a result of recent design wins, our processors have been included in personal computers and a smartwatch. However, we have limited experience selling in these new markets in which competition for design slots is intense, and may not achieve market acceptance or design wins in end user devices that are produced in substantial numbers. If we are unable to realize more revenue from the sale of our products for devices other than high-end smart phones, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to expand our product offerings.\nWe have expanded our product portfolio to include codecs, which can translate back and forth between analog audio and digital signals, motion sensor software and voice quality software. We have limited experience in designing audio codecs, motion sensor software and audio quality software, and selling processors that include audio codecs or software. The market for audio codecs, motion sensor software and audio quality software is intensely competitive and we may not achieve market acceptance or design wins in end user devices that are produced in substantial numbers. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties, complications and other unknown factors that may delay deployment of processors that include our audio codec or in our software releases. If we are unable to realize revenue from the sale of our processors incorporating audio codecs or from our software offerings, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue.\nIn November 2014, we announced our first generation of software products that improve audio quality, reduce background noise and assist with voice-controlled applications. In addition, we are developing new versions of our processors that feature the ability to track and process information from motion sensors. We have limited experience in designing and selling software products and processors with motion sensing capabilities and may not be successful in doing so. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties, complications and other unknown factors that may delay deployment of our processors or software. The markets for audio software and motion sensor solutions are rapidly evolving and we may not achieve market acceptance or design wins in end user devices that are produced in substantial numbers. A failure to integrate our audio processing with motion sensing software in a timely manner, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to realize revenue from the sale of our software and processors incorporating motion sensing, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue.\nIndex to Financial Statements We have a history of losses, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.\nSince our formation, we incurred a net loss in every year prior to 2010 and we incurred a net loss in 2014. Although we had net income in 2010 through 2013, we experienced a net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2013 and each quarter thereafter. We expect to incur net losses in the three months ending March 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $98.1 million.\nWe anticipate continuing to spend significantly to develop new processors and software solutions and expand our business, including expenditures for additional personnel in sales, marketing and research and development. As a public company, we will also continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of regulatory requirements. We may encounter unforeseen difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors that require additional expenditures. Due to these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain higher revenue in order to maintain and sustain profitability. Our rate of revenue growth may not be sustainable and we may not generate revenue in excess of our anticipated additional expenditures to maintain profitability.\nOur expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term. If sales are below expectations, our operating expenses would be disproportionately high relative to revenue, which would adversely impact our profitability. Although we were profitable in 2010 through 2013, we were not profitable in 2014. We do not expect to be profitable in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and we may not be able to return to profitability in the near term. Failure to return to profitability may require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and you should not rely on our quarterly comparisons as an indicator of future performance.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our sales cycles are long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require substantial time and expense. Our revenue is difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly. We ship a significant portion of our processors in the same quarter in which they are ordered such that small delays in receipt of purchase orders and shipment of products could result in our failure to achieve our internal forecasts or stock market expectations. In any quarter, our revenue may be largely attributable to the timing of our OEMs\u2019 orders. Our OEMs often increase purchases of our processors as part of product launches and the timing of those product launches may cause the timing of our orders with our OEMs to fluctuate. Our revenue depends on the ability of OEMs to sell mobile devices that incorporate our processors. In addition, we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the mix of more recently introduced products and older products that are subject to average selling price erosion resulting in declining margins, as well as the mix between sales of processors and license of our processor IP. For these reasons, comparisons of our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or the securities analysts that follow us, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOther factors that are difficult to predict and that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of shipments of our processors and the sale of mobile devices that have integrated and enabled our processor IP in each quarter;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which and the timing of when our OEMs launch new mobile devices incorporating our voice and audio processors;\n\u2022\ndeferral of purchases of existing mobile devices in anticipation of new devices from our OEMs;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new mobile device operating systems or upgrades and their impact on sales of existing mobile devices;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nthe timing of product introductions or upgrades or announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of one or more design wins with one or more significant OEMs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand and prices for our voice and audio processors;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost to manufacture, assemble and test our processors;\n\u2022\nOEMs overbuilding inventories of mobile devices and reducing purchases of our processors as they sell their excess inventory;\n\u2022\nefforts to reduce the cost and/or the bill of materials of OEMs\u2019 mobile devices and the impact on our pricing;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate changing demands and develop new technologies, products and improvements that meet OEM and MNO requirements on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nproduction delays as a result of manufacturing capacity or quality issues;\n\u2022\nunanticipated bad debt reserves or charges for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry standards in the mobile device industry;\n\u2022\nany change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation or the emergence of new competitors and announcements by us of significant acquisitions;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nother factors outside of our control.\nFor these reasons, comparisons of our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, support and management personnel. In particular, our ability to improve and maintain our technology requires talented software and hardware development engineers with specialized skills in areas such as computational auditory scene analysis algorithms, acoustic engineering, digital and analog integrated circuit design, sensor analysis software and mobile systems design and integration. If we are unable to recruit and retain these engineers, the quality and speed with which our solutions are developed would likely be seriously compromised and our reputation and business would suffer as a result. Our sales positions require candidates with specific sales and engineering backgrounds in the integrated circuit or mobile device manufacturing industries and we may be unable to locate and hire individuals with these credentials as quickly as needed, if at all. Once new sales personnel are hired, we need a reasonable amount of time to train them before they are able to effectively and efficiently perform their responsibilities. Failure to hire and retain qualified sales personnel could adversely impact our sales. Competition for these and the other personnel we require, particularly in Silicon Valley, is intense. In recent months, our employees have been subject to aggressive recruitment efforts by established publicly traded companies, which has led to an increase in attrition. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain employees receiving stock-based compensation. We may fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical, sales, support and management personnel necessary for our business. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary key personnel, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be harmed.\nIndex to Financial Statements The market for mobile device components is highly competitive and includes larger companies with significantly greater resources than we have. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased sales or increased pricing pressure, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe market for mobile device components is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. There are a number of components in the voice and audio subsystem of a mobile device including baseband processors, audio codecs and voice and audio processors. We provide voice and audio processors, and have begun providing audio codecs to compete in the mobile device component market. We have also started to offer software solutions for motion sensing, such as MotionQ, and voice quality, such as Audience S1.0, and in the future, may elect to expand our offerings further to include other subsystem components. As such, we compete and, in the future may continue to compete, against companies offering those subsystem components. Companies that currently compete for sales of other mobile device components may enter the voice and audio processor market with stand-alone components or software solutions with other functionalities and compete with us.\nWe currently face, or expect to face, competition from a number of established companies that produce components or software for the mobile device audio subsystem, or provide motion sensor solutions, such as Cirrus Logic, DSP Group, Maxim, NXP, InvenSense, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. We also face competition from smaller, privately held companies, such as Fortemedia and Hillcrest Labs, and could face competition from new market entrants, whether from new ventures or from established companies moving into the areas of voice and audio subsystems that our products address.\nWe also compete against solutions internally developed by OEMs, as well as third-party software and hardware systems. OEMs may seek to reduce the number of processors in their mobile devices and incorporate the functionality of our voice and audio processors into the central processing units of their mobile devices. OEMs may also internally develop or rely on third-party suppliers to provide central processing units that combine multiple functionalities, including those provided by our processors, which could reduce the demand for our processors and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nMany of our well established current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand awareness, a more diversified OEM base, a longer history of selling voice and audio subsystem components and software to OEMs and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result of their established presence in the industry, some of our competitors have substantial control and influence over future trends in the industry, including acceptance of a particular industry standard or competing technology. Many of our competitors benefit from long-standing relationships selling voice and audio subsystem components to key decision makers at many of our current and prospective OEMs. Our competitors may be able to leverage these existing OEM relationships to persuade our current and potential OEMs to purchase our competitors\u2019 products, regardless of the performance or features of our processors. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which could allow them to introduce new technologies and products to the market faster than we can. Because many of our competitors have greater resources than we have and are able to offer a more diversified and comprehensive bundle of products and services, these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, through which they could deliver competitive products or technologies at a lower price than our processors or provide free or promotional offers with the purchase of a package of products. Due to the larger production and sales volumes enjoyed by our larger competitors across multiple product families, our competitors may be able to negotiate price reductions, production dates and other concessions from their suppliers that we cannot. If our competitors are able to undercut our prices and/or improve their product performance, we may be unable to remain competitive in the industry and lose sales or be forced to reduce our selling prices. This could result in reduced gross margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or our failure to increase or maintain market segment share, any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain and support OEMs and to establish and maintain relationships with MNOs;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain engineering, sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nour processors\u2019 scalability, performance, quality, ease of use and cost effectiveness relative to those of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour success in developing and creating demand for new and proprietary technologies to offer products and features, including, but not limited to, our recently introduced VoiceQ feature;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to improve and enhance the features and functions of our current products;\n\u2022\nour success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies;\n\u2022\nour products\u2019 interoperability with various data access protocols and other voice and audio subsystem components of mobile devices;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to establish greater name recognition and build upon our reputation in the industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to respond effectively to aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including providing software solutions, selling at lower prices, bundling products, or asserting intellectual property rights, irrespective of the validity of the claims; and\n\u2022\nour ability to protect our intellectual property.\nIf the market for mobile devices with improved sound quality and the demand for our products do not continue to grow as we expect, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur processors are designed to address the sound quality challenges faced by users with their mobile devices. OEMs and MNOs may decide that the costs of additional improvements to sound quality outweigh the benefits, which could limit demand for our solutions. Users may also be satisfied with existing sound quality or blame poor quality on their MNOs\u2019 networks. The market for our products is evolving rapidly and is technologically challenging, and our future financial performance will depend in large part on growth of this market and our ability to adapt to user, OEM and MNO demands. Our current products are primarily focused on improving the sound quality of mobile devices. Consequently, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in or the absence of demand for products that improve sound quality. A number of factors could adversely affect the growth in the market or the demand for our products, including the following:\n\u2022\nintroduction of new mobile devices with different components or software that provide similar functionality as our products;\n\u2022\ninternally developed solutions that reduce the demand for our products;\n\u2022\nlower cost solutions;\n\u2022\nlack of user acceptance of sound quality improvements that we may develop or our inability to timely develop product enhancements that satisfy user requirements;\n\u2022\nOEM budgetary constraints or reduced bill of materials spending on sound quality solutions; and\n\u2022\nOEM design constraints for sound quality solutions and tradeoffs they face in the design process.\nIf the average selling prices of our products decrease, our revenue and gross margins could decline.\nConsistent with trends in the semiconductor industry, we have reduced the price of our products in the past and may do so in the future. Because of the resources available to and the broader product portfolios of many of\nIndex to Financial Statements\nour large, established competitors, erosion in average selling prices throughout our industry could have a larger impact on our business than on these large competitors. We may also elect to sell lower priced products to address the requirements of mobile devices with lower price points, which could cause our average selling prices, revenue and gross margins to decline. Our average selling prices and gross margins may vary substantially from period to period as a result of the mix of products we sell during any given period and the relative proportion of royalty revenue. As a result, our revenue and gross margin results in any period may fall short of investors\u2019 and securities analysts\u2019 expectations and our stock price may decline. If the capability of noise suppression hardware and/or software solutions offered by our competitors continues to increase, the average selling prices of our noise suppression products may decline. We may not be able to introduce additional, desired functionality into our products in a timely enough manner to prevent the price erosion of our products. If the average selling prices for our existing products decline without offsetting cost reductions and we are unable to introduce and develop significant demand for higher margin processors and audio codecs, we may be unable to maintain our gross margins and our revenue may decline. In addition, new products with additional functionality may have increased costs, but the selling prices for such new products may not offset such cost increases, which could reduce our gross margins.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing, selling or licensing new products that achieve market acceptance, our ability to attract and retain OEMs could be impaired, our competitive position could be harmed and our revenue could be reduced.\nWe compete in a market characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changing OEM needs, evolving MNO requirements and increasing user demands. We expect technical requirements of voice and audio solutions in mobile devices to evolve rapidly. Improvements in existing technologies and applications may reduce or eliminate the need for our products or our competitors may improve their product performance. The role played by our products may also be filled by products combining voice and audio processing and other aspects of the voice and audio subsystem. Improvements in other emerging technologies, such as reduction of background noise through MNO network components, could have a similar effect. Our future growth depends on our ability to anticipate future market needs and to successfully design, develop, market and sell new products that provide increasingly higher levels of user experience, performance, functionality and reliability that meet the cost expectations of our OEMs. We may also need to expand our product portfolio to perform some of the other functions of the voice and audio subsystems in mobile devices to achieve widespread market acceptance. In the event that noise suppression as a stand-alone feature is offered by competitors as a software solution or in combination with other hardware, our noise reduction products may be less attractive to OEMs. Developing our products is expensive and the development investment may involve a long payback cycle. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and extend our competitive position.\nOur new products must address technological changes and evolving industry standards and may not achieve market acceptance. In the event that new products require features that we have not developed or licensed, we will be required to develop or obtain such technology through purchase, license or other arrangements. If the required technology is not available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may incur additional expenses in an effort to internally develop the required technology.\nWe cannot assure you if or when the products and solutions on which we have focused our research and development expenditures, or have obtained through acquisitions, will become commercially successful or generate a sufficient return. Despite our efforts to develop new and successful voice and audio processor solutions, our competitors, many of whom have greater financial and engineering resources than we do, may be able to introduce new processors and/or software solutions more quickly and at reduced selling prices than we can. If our investments in acquisitions and research and development do not achieve market acceptance or the desired returns in a timely manner, our ability to attract and retain OEMs could be impaired, our competitive position could be harmed and our revenue could be reduced. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive or succeed in our strategy.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable. Our sales efforts often require substantial time and expenses and are often more than a year in advance of the first commercial sale of the mobile devices including our products.\nOur sales efforts involve educating our current and prospective OEMs and MNOs about the use and benefits of our processors as compared to sound quality solutions they currently use or other solutions that are available. OEMs often undertake a significant design, evaluation and test process that can result in a lengthy sales cycle that ranges from 9 to 12 months, but has, in some cases, exceeded 12 months from initial contact to the award of a design win. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that they will result in a design win or that the mobile device will be produced at scale. The award of design wins by our current and prospective OEMs are frequently subject to bill of material constraints, multiple approvals and a variety of administrative, processing and other delays. Purchases of our processors may also occur in connection with a new product launch, which may be delayed or postponed indefinitely. Once we secure a design win, it may be up to 12 months before the OEM begins commercial production of a corresponding mobile device and we begin to generate revenue. The effect of these factors tends to be magnified in the case of substantial mobile device redesigns that are unrelated to our products.\nThe selection processes for mobile device designs are lengthy and can require us both to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate significant engineering resources in pursuit of a single OEM opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our OEMs\u2019 products likely will have short life cycles. Failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from supplying an entire generation of a product. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. Our lengthy and uncertain sales cycles make it difficult for us to predict when OEMs may purchase and accept products from us or sell mobile phones that have integrated and enabled our licensed processor IP, may prevent us from recognizing revenue in a particular quarter and ultimately may not produce any sales. As a result, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nIf we are unable to adequately control our cost of revenue, our gross margins could decrease, we may not sustain or maintain profitability and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nThe largest component of our cost of revenue is production costs of our processors. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant efforts to reduce the cost of our processors, including but not limited to wafer costs. Our processors are fabricated by TSMC and GlobalFoundries, for both of which we are not a large customer. We rely on third parties, such as STATS ChipPAC Ltd. for assembly, packaging and test. The low volume of our orders relative to other customers at these suppliers makes it difficult for us to control the cost of the fabrication of our processors. As compared to our larger competitors, we typically do not purchase a sufficiently high volume of wafers and services to obtain the discounts that our larger competitors may be able to obtain from their foundries and other suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. If we are unable to reduce, or maintain controls over, our cost of manufacturing relative to our selling prices, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe may experience difficulties demonstrating the value to OEMs and MNOs of newer, higher priced products if they believe existing lower cost products are adequate to meet user expectations regarding sound quality, which would cause our revenue to decline and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAs we develop and introduce new solutions, including audio and multisensory solutions, we face the risk that OEMs may not understand or be willing to bear the additional cost of incorporating these newer solutions into their mobile devices. MNOs may also be unwilling to require OEMs to include newer sound quality solutions if they believe users are satisfied with current solutions. Transitioning OEMs and MNOs to newer generations of solutions involves a substantial\nIndex to Financial Statements\namount of time educating them on the benefits provided by the newer solutions. Regardless of the improved features or superior performance of the newer solutions, OEMs may be unwilling to adopt our new solutions as a result of design or cost constraints associated with their new mobile device introductions. We must also successfully manage product transition in order to minimize disruption in our OEMs\u2019 ordering and purchasing patterns, provide timely availability of sufficient supplies of new products to meet OEM demand and avoid reductions in the demand for our existing processors. If we fail to manage the transition successfully, we may have to write down or write off excess inventory. Due to the extensive time and resources that we invest in developing new solutions, if we are unable to sell OEMs new generations of our solutions, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIf our voice and audio processors fail to integrate or interoperate with our OEMs\u2019 product designs, including various system control and audio interface protocols, we may be unable to maintain or increase market segment share and we may experience reduced demand for our processors.\nOur products must integrate and interoperate with our OEMs\u2019 existing and future mobile devices, including components such as baseband processors, audio codecs, microphones and software applications, each of which may have different specifications. When new or updated versions of these components, interface protocols or software applications are introduced, or if we find defects in other vendors\u2019 or our OEMs\u2019 software or hardware or an incompatibility or deficiency in our products, we may need to develop updated versions of our products so that they interoperate properly. We may not complete these development efforts quickly, cost effectively or at all. These development efforts may require substantial capital investment and the devotion of substantial resources. In addition, our OEMs may rely on third-party vendors to provide chipset kits for our OEMs\u2019 use in designing their mobile devices. These chipset kits may not include our products and may include components, hardware requirements, interface protocols or software applications that do not interoperate properly with our products. If we fail to achieve and maintain compatibility with components, hardware requirements, interface protocols or software applications, our products may not be able to fulfill our OEMs\u2019 requirements, or we may experience longer design win and development cycles or our solutions may be designed out of mobile devices. As a result, demand for our products may decline and we may fail to increase or maintain market segment share.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties that make it difficult to forecast demand and production levels accurately and to have our products manufactured on a timely basis, which could interfere with our ability to deliver our processors and generate sales.\nSales of our processors are generally based on purchase orders with our OEMs rather than long-term purchase commitments. As a result, it is difficult to accurately forecast OEM demand for future periods. Our primary foundry, TSMC, produces silicon wafers for other fabless semiconductor companies in volumes that are far greater than ours. We do not have supply or timing commitments from TSMC or GlobalFoundries and our production orders are typically filled on a delayed basis as production capacity becomes available between larger orders. In order to secure foundry space for the production of our processors on a timely basis and to ensure that we have sufficient inventory to meet our OEMs\u2019 demands, we place orders with TSMC and GlobalFoundries well in advance of receipt of OEM orders. If we inaccurately forecast demand for our processors, we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties. Excess inventory levels could result in unexpected charges to operations that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Conversely, inadequate inventory levels could cause us to forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market segment share and harm our OEM relationships. As we continue to introduce new products, we may need to achieve volume production rapidly. We may need to increase our wafer purchases, foundry capacity and assembly, packaging and test operations if we experience increased demand. The inability of TSMC or GlobalFoundries, as the case may be, to provide us with adequate supplies of our processors on a timely basis, or an inability to obtain adequate quantities of wafers or packages, could cause a delay in our order fulfillment and could interfere with our ability to generate revenue.\nIndex to Financial Statements We rely on a limited number of manufacturing, assembly, packaging and test, as well as logistics, contractors, in some cases single sources, and any disruption or termination of these arrangements could delay shipments of our voice and audio processors and reduce our revenue.\nWe rely on a limited number of contractors for several key functions in producing our processors, including the processors themselves, which are primarily manufactured by TSMC and to a lesser extent by GlobalFoundries. We also rely on third parties, such as Signetics, Amkor and STATSChipPAC, for assembly, packaging, testing and warehousing, and other contractors for logistics. This reliance on a limited number of contractors involves several risks, including:\n\u2022\ncapacity constraints;\n\u2022\nprice increases;\n\u2022\ndelivery delays; and\n\u2022\nyield and other quality issues.\nIf any of these contractors were to cancel or materially change their commitments to us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to allow us to timely manufacture, assemble, package, test and deliver our processors, we could lose time-sensitive OEM orders or be forced to pay damages for the cost of replacement components, be unable to develop or sell certain processors cost effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and experience significantly reduced revenue. In the event that it became necessary to find other contractors, transition to a new vendor could take significant time due to the technology development process and other qualification criteria for a different contractor. For example, developing a second source foundry for one of our products could require us to redesign the product to meet the specialized requirements of that foundry. Inadequate supplies of critical components, such as wafers or packages, may also impair our ability to fulfill orders in a given quarter and/or result in a decrease in our revenue.\nWe currently rely primarily on TSMC to manufacture our processors and to a lesser extent, GlobalFoundries. Our reliance on TSMC and GlobalFoundries reduces our control over the fabrication process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, production costs and product supply. If we fail to manage our relationship with TSMC and GlobalFoundries effectively, or if TSMC or GlobalFoundries experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or yield problems in its operations, our ability to ship products to our OEMs could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. We do not have a supply agreement with TSMC or GlobalFoundries and neither of them is under any obligation to continue to supply us at all or at the capacity we need. We are a relatively small customer of each of TSMC and GlobalFoundries and, in times of capacity constraint, we may not receive the capacity allocation we need. If TSMC or GlobalFoundries, as the case may be, is unwilling or unable to meet our production requirements, we would be required to engage a new foundry. Qualifying a new foundry and commencing volume production would be expensive and time consuming. While we have engaged GlobalFoundries to produce some of our products, the transfer of additional products that we currently produce at TSMC to GlobalFoundries or vice versa may require significant redesign of such processors. Any redesign may take nine months or more to complete and may involve further delays if such redesigned products do not meet our or our OEMs\u2019 performance specifications. If we are required to change foundries or move between production lines of a particular foundry or other supplier for any reason, this could disrupt the supply of our processors and increase our costs.\nDisruption or termination of supplies from TSMC or GlobalFoundries and problems with yield of good die from the wafers we purchase from them could delay shipments of our products and materially and adversely affect our operating results. Production delays and quality defects are often outside of our control and are difficult to predict. Any delay of shipments or the existence of defects in our products could damage our relationships with current and prospective OEMs, increase our costs due to the time and money spent remedying the defects and reduce our revenue.\nIf flaws in the design, production or test of our processors were to occur, we could experience a failure rate in our products that could result in substantial yield reductions, increased manufacturing costs and harm to our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nreputation. We may be required to accept warranty returns from our OEMs due to production defects and may be unable to resell and have to scrap the defective products. Even minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield losses or cause halts in production. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience quality problems with the die provided by our foundries and quality problems with packaging and other production activities. Our foundries and other contract manufacturers may not be able to detect these defects early in the fabrication process or determine the cause of such defects in a timely manner, which may affect the quality or reliability of our products. Although we have procedures in place to monitor the quality of our foundries\u2019 and other contract manufacturers\u2019 processes, we cannot assure you that our efforts will be sufficient to avoid a rate of failure in our processors that results in substantial delays in shipment or significant repair or replacement costs, any of which could result in lost sales, harm to our reputation and an increase in our operating costs.\nAny errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in a loss of OEM business, a termination of design wins or increased warranty costs, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We may also face claims for product liability and breach of warranty, including claims relating to the manner in which our products interact with other components of mobile devices produced by our OEMs. We may also be required to indemnify our OEMs for losses allegedly caused by our voice and audio solutions that are incorporated into their mobile devices. Any warranty or other rights we may have against our suppliers for yield or other quality issues caused by them may be more limited than those our OEMs have against us, based on our relative size, bargaining power or otherwise. We cannot assure you that our warranty reserves will be sufficient or either increase or decrease in future periods. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and might divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our solutions. In addition, if the amount and scope of our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate for a claim, or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be harmed. Past quality problems could also impair our ability to achieve new design wins with an OEM.\nOur voice and audio processors may fail to meet OEM or MNO specifications or may contain undetected software or hardware defects that might result in liability to us or our OEMs or MNOs, harm to our reputation, a loss of OEMs and a reduction in our revenue.\nOur processors are highly technical and complex. In many cases, our processors are assembled in customized packages or feature high levels of integration. Our products may fail to meet exacting OEM specifications for sound quality, performance and reliability or may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities that could result in degradation in voice and audio data quality or other product failures. Some errors in our processors may only be discovered after they have been incorporated into our OEMs\u2019 mobile devices. Resolving these errors and defects may require a significant amount of time and resources. If our voice and audio processors fail to meet OEM or MNO specifications or contain undetected software or hardware defects, we and our OEMs or MNOs may incur liability, our reputation and relationships with our OEMs and MNOs may be harmed and our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with MNOs or establish new MNO relationships, we may not be able to affect MNO demand for mobile devices that meet high sound quality specifications, which may limit our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have invested and continue to invest significant resources in working with MNOs to educate them about the impact of sound quality on the user experience in order to increase awareness of and demand for our processors. We also intend to collaborate with MNOs in new geographic markets in order to extend our geographic reach. MNOs may not value the improvements in sound quality that our products can provide. The specifications that MNOs impose on their OEMs may not be sufficiently high to differentiate our processors compared to the solutions of our competitors. MNOs may grant waivers to their sound quality specifications if individual mobile devices do not meet the specifications but provide other benefits to users. We do not have and\nIndex to Financial Statements\ndo not expect to have any influence on whether a MNO waives compliance with its specifications. In addition, mobile device specifications and the level of control of MNOs over the mobile devices operating on their networks vary by OEM and geography. MNOs in geographic markets outside of the United States may impose sound quality specifications on their OEMs which are not as high as specifications by leading MNOs in the United States, which could reduce demand for the improvements in sound quality that our processors can provide and harm our ability to differentiate our processors from the solutions of our competitors in these markets. As a result, we may be unable to extend or maintain our geographic reach, which could limit our growth and harm our business. We do not have any long-term contracts with the MNOs we work with and these MNOs have no obligation to require the use of our products by their OEMs or to impose or enforce a certain level of sound quality specifications. If we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with MNOs, we may not realize the potential benefits that we believe these relationships can provide. We cannot assure you that MNOs will continue to work with us to assess and evaluate their voice and audio requirements. If we are unable to maintain or expand our existing relationships with MNOs or enter into new MNO relationships, demand for our products may decline and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be affected by changes in the relative mix of our operations and income among different geographic regions and by proposed and enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation, which could affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have sought to structure our worldwide operations to take advantage of certain international tax planning opportunities and incentives. Our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities in various jurisdictions challenge our international tax structure or if the relative mix of our U.S. and international income changes for any reason, or if U.S. or international tax laws were to change in the future. In particular, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S. Foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. In the past, the U.S. Administration has considered initiatives such as limitations on deferral of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, eliminating utilization or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., which could substantially reduce our ability to defer U.S. taxes. If any of these proposals are constituted into law, they could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We cannot assure you that our effective tax rate will not increase in the future.\nWe may not be able to sustain or manage any future growth effectively. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, sell our voice and audio solutions successfully and adequately address competitive challenges. As a result, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may suffer.\nIn recent periods, we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our business. Our future growth prospects depend in large part on our ability to secure design wins and orders from a broader OEM base, our ability to establish and expand our relationships with key suppliers to expand our product manufacturing, assembly, packaging, test and delivery capacity and our ability to manage our growing business effectively. In addition, we recently acquired Sensor Platforms, which will add motion sensing software to our technology offering. We have also expanded our international operations and as of December 31, 2014 had offices outside of the United States in China, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Continued growth in our business will place significant demands on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. Successful management of any future growth will require substantial management attention with respect to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintaining and expanding our relationships with OEMs and MNOs and educating and supporting their product design and quality personnel;\n\u2022\nanticipating and meeting the technology needs of users;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\ncontinuing to expand and improve our intellectual property portfolio and making technological advances;\n\u2022\nexpanding our relationships with our foundries and assembly, packaging, test and logistics providers and entering into new relationships with additional foundries, assembly, packaging, test and logistics providers to ensure that we can produce, test and deliver sufficient processors to meet market demand;\n\u2022\nrecruiting, hiring, integrating and retaining highly skilled and motivated individuals, including research and development and sales personnel;\n\u2022\nexpanding and broadening our product development capabilities, including managing our own design center outside the United States;\n\u2022\naccurately forecasting revenue and controlling costs;\n\u2022\nenhancing and expanding our infrastructure;\n\u2022\nmanaging inventory levels;\n\u2022\nexpanding our international operations and managing increasingly dispersed geographic locations and facilities; and\n\u2022\nimplementing and improving our company-wide processes and procedures to address human resource, financial reporting and financial management matters.\nIf we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively or to manage any future growth we may experience, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business plan, sell our voice and audio solutions successfully, remain competitive, maintain OEM relationships or attract new OEMs. Our failure to effectively sustain or manage any future growth we do experience could result in a reduction in our revenue and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our business.\nWe recently acquired Sensor Platforms, and in the future, we may acquire other businesses, products or technologies. Our ability to make and successfully integrate acquisitions is unproven and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our recent acquisition or any other future acquisition. Any acquisition, including our acquisition of Sensor Platforms, has numerous risks. Such acquisitions may not strengthen our competitive position or achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses in a timely manner, or at all, and these acquisitions may be viewed negatively by OEMs, financial markets or investors. In addition, any acquisitions we make could lead to difficulties in integrating personnel, technologies and operations from the acquired businesses. We may also experience difficulty in retaining and motivating key personnel, as well as key customers, vendors and other business partners from these businesses. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities and employees from other opportunities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Acquisitions may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, any of which could harm our business. Mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndex to Financial Statements We may be required to recognize a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors that would suggest a possible impairment include, but are not limited to a significant decrease in our stock price, material customer losses, an adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or a loss in key personnel. We recorded goodwill related to a prior acquisition, and may do so in connection with any potential future acquisitions. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined, which would adversely impact our results of operations. For example, during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $31.3 million impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets which was the result of a change in our enterprise value, based on the trading prices of our common stock.\nThe political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have generated substantially all of our revenue from sales to CMs and OEMs that manufacture in Asia or distributors located in Asia and we expect sales to such CMs, OEMs and distributors to contribute a majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future. We have sales and technical support personnel in countries other than the United States and we outsource all manufacturing, assembly, packaging and test of our processors to third parties in Asia, as well as a portion of product development to third parties outside the U.S. During 2012, we opened our own design center in India and sales and sales support operations in China. During 2013 and 2014, we continued to expand our operations in these locations. Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of managing a development team in geographically disparate locations;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor relations issues;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts, judgments and arbitration awards and collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nimpediments to the flow of foreign exchange capital payments and receipts due to exchange controls instituted by certain foreign governments;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our processors in various foreign markets, threats to U.S. national security or violation of U.S. laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining governmental and export approvals for communications, processors and other products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by the U.S. government on our ability to do business with certain companies or in certain countries as a result of international political conflicts;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties and unanticipated changes in local laws and regulations, including tax laws;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability.\nIndex to Financial Statements As we expand our business globally, including China, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our business plan, maintaining and growing our existing OEM base or achieving and sustaining profitability. Failure to generate sufficient revenue, achieve planned gross margins or control operating costs may require us to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all and could require us to modify, delay or abandon some of our planned future expansion or expenditures or reduce some of our ongoing operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and ability to achieve our intended business objectives. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nBecause a portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, we have paid our suppliers and sold our products in U.S. dollars. We have also historically paid our outsourced research and development services provider in U.S. dollars. As we start performing those research and development activities ourselves and have more significant non-U.S. payroll and operating expenses, we may begin to incur material expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Increases in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could increase our operating expenses. In addition, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our products to OEMs that produce and sell their mobile devices outside of the United States. This may increase pressure on and result in erosion of our average sales prices without any offset in our production costs if we continue to pay those expenses in U.S. dollars, which could compress our margins. Average selling price erosion, compressed margins and increased operating expenses could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business is vulnerable to interruption by events beyond our control, including earthquakes, fire, floods, disease outbreaks and other catastrophic events.\nOur corporate headquarters and the operations of our key OEMs, foundries and third-party contractors which we rely on for assembly, packaging, testing, warehousing and logistics are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, including the San Francisco Bay area, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Our finished goods inventory of processors for many of our OEMs, including Samsung, is warehoused at a single facility located in Singapore, and any catastrophic loss to this facility could significantly disrupt our operations and delay shipments and revenue. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire or flood, or other catastrophic event such as disease outbreak, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In the event that any of our OEMs\u2019 or CMs\u2019 information technology systems, manufacturing facilities or logistics abilities are impeded by any of these events, shipments could be delayed and we could miss key financial targets, including revenue and earnings estimates, for a particular quarter.\nIndex to Financial Statements Risks related to regulations to which we may be subject and our intellectual property\nConcerns over possible health and safety risks posed by mobile devices may result in the adoption of new regulations and may otherwise reduce the demand for our products and those of our OEMs.\nConcerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect of discouraging the use of mobile devices, which may decrease demand for our products and those of our OEMs. In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including mobile phones and other mobile devices. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of mobile devices while driving. These concerns and any future legislation that may be adopted in response to them, could reduce demand for our products and those of our OEMs in the United States as well as other countries, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nClaims of infringement against us or our OEMs could increase our expenses, disrupt our ability to sell our voice and audio solutions and reduce our revenue.\nThe mobile communications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim that our processors or technologies infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. The costs associated with any actual, pending or threatened litigation could negatively impact our operating results regardless of the actual outcome.\nWe expect that infringement claims and misappropriation claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or misappropriate, or that we will not in the future infringe or misappropriate, any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. For instance, because patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are typically maintained in confidence for up to 18 months after their filing or, in some cases, for the entire time prior to issuance as a U.S. patent, third parties may have earlier filed applications covering methods or other inventions that we consider our trade secrets. The limited size of our patent portfolio may not provide meaningful deterrence against third parties alleging that we infringe their patents, particularly against patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue. Any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claims and could distract our management from our business. A party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our processors or licensing our processor IP. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of the infringed intellectual property, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we might be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately be unsuccessful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThird parties may also assert infringement claims against our OEMs. Claims against our OEMs may require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on an OEM\u2019s behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally agree to defend and indemnify our OEMs with which we have long-term agreements from claims of infringement and misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties based on the use or resale of our products. Other OEMs, with which we do not have formal agreements requiring us to indemnify them, may ask us to indemnify them if a claim is made as a condition to awarding future design wins to us. Because our OEMs are much larger than we are and have much greater resources than we do, they may be more likely to be the target of an infringement claim by third parties than we would be, which could increase our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nchances of becoming involved in a future lawsuit. If any of these claims succeeds, we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our OEMs that could increase our expenses, disrupt our ability to sell our voice and audio solutions and reduce our revenue. A party making an infringement claim against our OEMs, if successful, could secure an injunction or other court order that could prevent our OEMs from producing or selling their mobile devices incorporating our products. Any such claims or injunction against our OEMs could seriously harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe mobile device market is one in which competition is intense and OEMs attempt to defend and expand their market positions with their patent portfolios. In the event that one of our key OEMs were unable to market its products in one or more large geographic markets because of a court decision concluding that the OEM infringed another party\u2019s patents, our revenue would be harmed. Our OEMs or their CMs may purchase fewer of our processors than they did in the past if such OEMs are enjoined from selling the mobile devices in which our processors are incorporated in certain markets or are required to redesign such mobile devices as a result of patent litigation. We anticipate that mobile device OEMs will continue to bring and litigate patent infringement cases against each other for some time and cannot assess the impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows from these cases.\nIt is also not uncommon for foundries, packaging providers or suppliers of other components in our processors to be involved in infringement lawsuits by or against third parties. Although some of our foundries, packaging providers or other suppliers are obligated to indemnify us in connection with infringement claims related to their intellectual property rights, these parties may contest their obligations to indemnify us, or their available assets or indemnity obligation may not be sufficient to cover our losses. Third-party intellectual property infringement claims that involve us or our suppliers may require us to alter our technologies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.\nWe may not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position and reduce the value of our proprietary technology.\nOur success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to prevent such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. As of December 31, 2014, we held 68 issued U.S. patents expiring between July 2019 and July 2033 and also had 127 U.S. patent applications pending. As of December 31, 2014, we also had 47 pending foreign patent applications and 12 foreign patents issued. Each foreign patent and foreign patent application is related to a U.S. patent or a pending U.S. patent application. Our patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and, as a result, our competitors may be able to copy or develop technologies similar or superior to ours. In some countries where our processors are sold or may be sold, we do not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to some of our U.S. patents and patent applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our technology, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, any enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims\nIndex to Financial Statements\nagainst us. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. We may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nPatent protection outside of the United States is generally not as comprehensive as in the United States and may not protect our intellectual property in some countries where our processors are sold or may be sold in the future. Even if patents are granted outside of the United States, effective enforcement in those countries may not be available. For example, the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in China is relatively weak and it is often difficult to create and enforce such rights. Furthermore, we have historically only filed foreign patent applications in a limited number of countries and for only a relatively small subset of our U.S. patent application portfolio. Even so, we may not be able to effectively protect intellectual property rights in China or elsewhere, even if patents are granted for these filed, foreign applications. Many companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement in countries where we sell or intend to sell processors. If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our processors at competitive prices and to be a leading provider of processors may be adversely affected and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nOur products include intellectual property licensed from third parties, such as certain design technology, circuits and manufacturing rights for processor cores. It may be necessary in the future to renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses. We cannot assure you that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain, maintain and renew certain licenses or other rights on favorable terms, or at all, and our involvement in litigation regarding third-party intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property rights and on our business.\nWe may use software licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses in certain of our products. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and in less time and result in a loss of product sales for us. It is possible that our use of open source software may trigger the foregoing requirements. Furthermore, there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and political parties by us for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law and for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any\nIndex to Financial Statements\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anticorruption laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nBecause we incorporate U.S. origin technology into our processors, our processors are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported or licensed outside of the United States only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception. If a transaction involves countries, individuals or entities that are the target of U.S. or other economic sanctions, licenses or other approvals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control or other sanctions authorities may be required and may not be granted. Various countries regulate the importation of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our processors or license our processor IP in such countries or could limit our OEMs\u2019 ability to sell mobile devices incorporating our processors in those countries. Changes in our processors or changes in export or import or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction of our processors in international markets, prevent our OEMs with international operations from incorporating our processors in their products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our processors to certain countries altogether. Any change in export, import or economic sanctions regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our processors by, or in our decreased ability to export, license or sell our processors to, existing or potential OEMs with international operations. Failure to obtain required import or export approval for our processors or failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties and restrictions on export privileges and could impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nWe, our OEMs and third-party contractors are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may delay or interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe face increasing complexity in our research and development and procurement operations as a result of requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our processors, including the European Union\u2019s (\u201cEU\u2019s\u201d) Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive, which restricts the content of lead and certain other substances in specified electronic products put on the market in the EU after July 1, 2006 and similar Chinese legislation relating to marking of electronic products which became effective in March 2007. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, civil or criminal sanctions and contract damage claims, which could harm our business, reputation and operating results. The passage of similar requirements in additional jurisdictions or the tightening of these standards in jurisdictions where our products are already subject to such requirements could cause us to incur significant expenditures to make our products compliant with new requirements, or could limit the markets into which we may sell our products. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our processors to use components that are compatible with these regulations and this reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us.\nSome of our operations, as well as the operations of our CMs and foundries and other suppliers, are also regulated under various other federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws and requirements, including those governing, among other matters, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management, disposal, handling, use, labeling of and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws will not occur in the future, as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws and regulations have increasingly become more stringent over time. We expect that our products and operations will be affected by new environmental requirements on an ongoing basis, which will likely result in additional costs, which could adversely affect our business. Our failure to comply with present and future environmental, health and safety\nIndex to Financial Statements\nlaws could cause us to incur substantial costs, result in civil or criminal fines and penalties and decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results. Failure by our foundries or other suppliers to comply with applicable environmental laws and requirements could cause disruptions and delays in our product shipments, which could adversely affect our relations with our OEMs and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of efforts by us and our third-party contractors to comply with these or other future environmental laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs, including those relating to excess component inventory, and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, we will need to procure the manufacture of compliant processors and source compliant components from suppliers. We cannot assure you that existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to the ownership of our common stock\nThe trading prices of our common stock could be volatile due to a number of factors.\nThe trading prices of our common stock have been highly volatile and could be highly volatile in the future due to a number of factors. For example, since our IPO, the closing sale prices of our common stock ranged from a low of $3.32 to a high of $22.36. In addition, following our announcement in October 2014 regarding the continued softness in demand for high-end smart phones incorporating our products and our expectation that we would not see a recovery in such high-end smart phones during the remainder of 2014, the trading price of our common stock declined significantly. Factors that could affect the trading price of our common stock, some of which are outside of our control, include the following:\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant OEMs or other developments involving our OEMs;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in recommendations by any securities analysts who elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour failure to receive ongoing analyst coverage;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity and investors\u2019 general perception of us;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results or those of our competitors or other companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated announcements of technological innovations, new services or service improvements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlevel of sales in a particular quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock or other changes in the volume of trading in our stock;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business or our OEMs.\nIf the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect\nIndex to Financial Statements\nother companies in our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common stock.\nWe are involved in securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar litigation in the future. If the outcome of this litigation is unfavorable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOn September 13, 2012, a purported shareholder filed a class action complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for Santa Clara County against us, the members of our board of directors, two of our executive officers and the underwriters of our IPO. On April 3, 2013, the outside members of the board of directors and the underwriters were dismissed without prejudice. An amended complaint was filed on February 25, 2013, which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our common stock issued in or traceable to the IPO. The amended complaint added additional shareholder plaintiffs and contains claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. The amended complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages, rescission and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On March 1, 2013, we and the other defendants responded to the amended complaint by filing a demurrer moving to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. The court overruled that demurrer. On March 27, 2013, we and the other defendants filed a demurrer moving to dismiss the amended complaint on other grounds. The court denied the demurrer on September 4, 2013. On January 16, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify a class. A trial has been scheduled for September 21, 2015.We believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously contest the action. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense and we cannot currently estimate a range of any possible losses we may experience in connection with this case. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to estimate the effects of this complaint on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn the future, especially following periods of volatility in the market price of our shares, other purported class action or derivative complaints may be filed against us. The outcome of the pending and potential future litigation is difficult to predict and quantify and the defense of such claims or actions can be costly. In addition to diverting financial and management resources and general business disruption, we may suffer from adverse publicity that could harm our brand or reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable. A judgment or settlement that is not covered by or is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims, or our obligations to indemnify the underwriters and the individual defendants, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur management has broad discretion as to the use of our cash and might invest or spend our cash in ways that may not yield a return.\nOur management might not apply our cash in ways that increase the value of our common stock. We expect to use our cash for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of our cash. The holders of our common stock may not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our cash. Until our cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or lose value.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. A small number of securities analysts\u2019 commenced coverage of us after the closing of our IPO. If one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. For example, following our announcement in July 2014 that we believed demand from Samsung would decline as a\nIndex to Financial Statements\nresult of end user demand for high-end smart phones, and our announcement in October 2014 regarding the continued softness in demand for high-end smart phones incorporating our products, securities analysts downgraded our stock and the trading price of our common stock declined significantly. If one or more of these analysts stops coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and investor expectations, causing our stock price to decline.\nFrom time to time, we may release guidance in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represent our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. If given, this guidance, which will include forward-looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The principal reason that we expect to release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. With or without our guidance, analysts and other investors may publish expectations regarding our business, financial performance and results of operations. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third persons. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. If our actual performance does not meet or exceed our guidance or investor expectations, the trading price of our common stock is likely to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company upon the earliest of (i) January 1, 2018, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nIndex to Financial Statements If we experience material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, operating results or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, under Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year beginning with 2013. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting and, once we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nSection 404 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the Annual Report that we filed with the SEC for 2013. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) January 1, 2018, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, operating results or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we would lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our independent auditors will not be required to attest to their effectiveness while we are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. If our management and our independent auditors determine we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in us. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Although we may benefit from some of the disclosure and attestation deferrals for the period in which we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we do not expect those deferrals to materially alter the costs and burdens we will experience as a public company. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\nIndex to Financial Statements\nstatements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) January 1, 2018, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. Greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies. If we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the applicable stock exchange or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Because the JOBS Act has only recently been enacted, it is not yet clear whether investors will accept the more limited disclosure requirements that we may be entitled to follow while we are an emerging growth company. To the extent investors are not comfortable with a more limited disclosure regime, they may not be comfortable purchasing and holding our common stock if we elect to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements. We also expect that, as a public company, it will continue to be expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nNew disclosure requirements under the new provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could increase our costs and limit the supply of certain metals used in our products and affect our reputation with customers and stockholders.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements require us to engage in due diligence efforts beginning in 2013 to ascertain and disclose the origin of some of the raw materials used in our products. Despite litigation resulting in the limitation of certain requirements, initial disclosures were required no later than May 31, 2014, with subsequent disclosures required no later than May 31 of each following year. We incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including due diligence to determine the sources of materials used in our products and other potential changes to our products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such due diligence. The implementation of these requirements and our compliance procedures could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals, we cannot be sure that the foundries that manufacture our products will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of materials from such suppliers or at competitive prices. Also, our reputation with our customers and our stockholders could be damaged if we determine that our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the materials used in our products through the procedures we may implement. If we cannot guarantee that all of our products exclude conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, certain of our customers may discontinue or reduce purchases of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder\nIndex to Financial Statements\napproval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. In addition, these stockholders, if acting together, have the ability to exercise significant influence over the management and affairs of our company. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; and\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nResponding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Furthermore, any perceived uncertainties may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that our stockholders may consider advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which has the effect of requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us by prohibiting stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We expect to retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfuture will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13402, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ADNC"}
