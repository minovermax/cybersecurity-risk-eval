{"cik": "1106838", "company": "Chanticleer Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risks. Prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider, among other things, the following risk factors in connection with the other information and financial statements contained in this Report. We have identified the following factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we may make from time to time.\nWe operate in a continually changing business environment in which new risk factors emerge from time to time. We can neither predict these new risk factors, nor can we assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statement. If any of these risks, or combination of risks, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously and materially harmed, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Industry\nWe have not been profitable to date and expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future; we may never be profitable.\nWe have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows since our inception and have financed our operations principally through equity investments and borrowings. At this time, our ability to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations is uncertain. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we had net revenue of $29.8 million and incurred a net loss of $6.4 million. Our total accumulated deficit through December 31, 2014, was $21.3 million.\nAs a result of our brief operating history, revenue is difficult to predict with certainty. Current and projected expense levels are based largely on estimates of future revenue. We expect expenses to increase in the future as we expand our activities. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Accordingly, the extent of our future losses and the time required to achieve profitability, if ever, is uncertain. Failure to achieve profitability could materially and adversely affect the value of our Company and our ability to effect additional financings. The success of the business depends on our ability to increase revenues to offset expenses. If our revenues fall short of projections, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe recent acquisitions of ABC, Just Fresh, the Hooters NW Pacific restaurants, Hooters Nottingham, Hooters locations in Australia, BGR: The Burger Joint (\u201cBGR\u201d) in March 2015, as well as future acquisitions, may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nConsistent with our growth strategy, we have recently acquired a 100% ownership interest in ABC, 100% of Hooters Nottingham, 100% of Hooters NW, and a 56% ownership interest in entities owning Just Fresh. We also recently acquired the Hooters Australia restaurants in which we have a 60% ownership interest. In March 2015, we acquired the assets of BGR. We may seek to selectively acquire additional restaurants and bar concepts as part of our strategy. To do so, we would need to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any such acquisition that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u25cf material adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition as the acquired restaurants and bar concepts are integrated into our operations;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering into markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf problems retaining key personnel;\n\u25cf potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisition;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf difficulties of integration and failure to realize anticipated synergies; and\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of restaurants and bar concepts or other acquisitions, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of our equity securities or a combination of both, could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nThere are risks inherent in expansion of operations, including our ability to acquire additional territories, generate profits from new restaurants, find suitable sites and develop and construct locations in a timely and cost-effective way.\nWe cannot project with certainty the number of territories we will be able to acquire or the number of new restaurants we and our partners will open in accordance with our present plans and within the timeline or the budgets that we currently project. In addition, our franchise agreements with Hooters of America, Inc. (\u201cHOA\u201d) provide that we must exercise our option to open additional restaurants within each of our territories by a certain date set forth in the development schedule and that each such restaurant must be open by such date. If we fail to timely exercise any option or if we fail to open any additional restaurant by the required restaurant opening date, all of our rights to develop the rest of the option territory will expire automatically and without further notice.\nOur failure to effectively develop locations in new territories would adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan by, among other things, reducing our revenues and profits and preventing us from realizing our strategy. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our new restaurants will generate revenues or profit margins consistent with those currently operated by us.\nThe number of openings and the performance of new locations will depend on various factors, including:\n\u25cf the availability of suitable sites for new locations and our ability to secure HOA\u2019s approval of a proposed site;\n\u25cf our ability to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, obtain adequate financing, on favorable terms, required to construct, build-out and operate new locations and meet construction schedules, and hire and train and retain qualified restaurant managers and personnel;\n\u25cf managing construction and development costs of new restaurants at affordable levels;\n\u25cf the establishment of brand awareness in new markets; and\n\u25cf the ability of our Company to manage this anticipated expansion.\nWhile the impact varies with the location and the qualifications of our partners, tight credit markets are generally making financing for construction and operation of restaurants more difficult to obtain on favorable terms. Additionally, competition for suitable restaurant sites in target markets is intense. Not all of these factors are within our control or the control of our partners, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to accelerate our growth or that we will be able to manage the anticipated expansion of our operations effectively.\nWe have debt financing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, and may impair our ability to react quickly to changes in our business.\nOur exposure to debt financing could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate future cash flows to the repayment of debt, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could materially increase the impact of these risks on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our results of operations as well as our future business.\nWe are subject to litigation and other customer complaints concerning our food safety, service, and/or other operational factors. Guests may file formal litigation complaints that we are required to defend, whether or not we believe them to be true. Substantial, complex or extended litigation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we incur substantial defense costs and our management is distracted. Employees may also, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, discrimination, wage and hour, and other employment issues. Additionally, potential disputes could subject us to litigation alleging non-compliance with franchise, development, support service, or other agreements. Additionally, we are subject to the risk of litigation by our stockholders as a result of factors including, but not limited to, performance of our stock price.\nIn certain states we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some dram shop litigation against restaurant companies has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, but we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate in the event we are found liable in a dram shop case.\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate in its impact. A variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our Company, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or outdated information. The inappropriate use of social media platforms by our guests, employees, or other individuals could increase our costs, lead to litigation, or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is intensive competition in our industry, and we will be competing with national, regional chains and independent restaurant operators.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. Moreover, the retail food industry in general is highly competitive and includes highly sophisticated national and regional chains. Our sector is highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambiance and condition of each restaurant. While we strive to differentiate ourselves through the items we offer on our menu and the environment in which they are offered, we will, nonetheless, be required to compete with national and regional chains and with independent operators for market share, access to desirable locations and recruitment of personnel. No assurances can be given that we will have the financial resources, distribution ability, depth of key personnel or marketing expertise to compete successfully in these markets. We recently decided to exit the business of our Dallas restaurant Spoon Bar & Kitchen, and we may be forced to exit the business of other restaurants as well.\nIn addition, although our franchise agreements grant us certain rights to develop restaurants within the specified territories, HOA has reserved the right to develop, open and operate and to authorize others to develop, open and operate Hooters restaurants outside of our \u201cprotected territory.\u201d Our \u201cprotected territory\u201d is limited to a radius of 8 kilometers from any restaurant location we open. Therefore, HOA or one of its franchisees could effectively compete against us even in the territories in which we develop our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur rights to operate and franchise Hooters-branded restaurants are dependent on the Hooters\u2019 franchise agreements.\nOur rights to operate and franchise Hooters-branded restaurants, and our ability to conduct our business, derive principally from the rights granted or to be granted to us by Hooters in our franchise agreements. As a result, our ability to continue operating in our current capacity is dependent on the continuation and renewal of our contractual relationship with Hooters.\nIn the event Hooters does not grant us franchises to acquire additional locations or terminates our existing franchise agreements, we would be unable to operate and/or expand our Hooters-branded restaurants, identify our business with Hooters nor use any of Hooters\u2019 intellectual property. As the Hooters brand and our relationship with Hooters are among our competitive strengths, the failure to grant or the expiration or termination of the franchise agreements would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur business depends on our relationship with Hooters and changes in this relationship may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPursuant to the franchise agreements, Hooters has the ability to exercise substantial influence over the conduct of our business. We must comply with Hooters\u2019 high quality standards. We cannot transfer the equity interests of our subsidiaries without Hooters\u2019 consent, and Hooters has the right to control many of the locations\u2019 daily operations.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Hooters has no obligation to fund our operations. In addition, Hooters does not guarantee any of our financial obligations, including trade payables or outstanding indebtedness, and has no obligation to do so. If the terms of the franchise agreements excessively restrict our ability to operate our business or if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the franchise agreements, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not have full operational control over the businesses where we control less than 100% ownership.\nWe are and will be dependent on our partners to maintain quality, service and cleanliness standards, and their failure to do so could materially affect our brands and harm our future growth. We do not presently have formal written agreements in place with any of our partners regarding these types of matters. Although we intend to exercise significant control over partners through written agreements in the future, our partners will continue to have some flexibility in the operations, including the ability to set prices for our products in their restaurants, hire employees and select certain service providers. In addition, it is possible that some partners may not operate their restaurants in accordance with our quality, service and cleanliness, health or product standards. Although we intend to take corrective measures if partners fail to maintain high quality, service and cleanliness standards, we may not be able to identify and rectify problems with sufficient speed and, as a result, our image and operating results may be negatively affected.\nA failure by Hooters to protect its intellectual property rights, including its brand image, could harm our results of operations.\nThe profitability of our business depends in part on consumers\u2019 perception of the strength of the Hooters brand. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, we are required to assist Hooters with protecting its intellectual property rights in our jurisdictions. Nevertheless, any failure by Hooters to protect its proprietary rights in the world could harm its brand image, which could affect our competitive position and our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by declines in discretionary spending and may be affected by changes in consumer preferences.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or cuisine could harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. A continuing decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nIncreases in costs, including food, labor and energy prices, will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in our operating costs, including food, labor, occupancy (including utilities and energy), insurance and supplies costs. Various factors beyond our control, including climatic changes and government regulations, may affect food costs. Specifically, our dependence on frequent, timely deliveries of fresh meat and produce subject us to the risks of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions which could adversely affect the availability and cost of any such items. In the past, we have been able to recover some of our higher operating costs through increased menu prices. There have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases, and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety. The recent volatility in certain commodity markets, such as those for energy, grains and dairy products, which have experienced significant increases in prices, may have an adverse effect on us and may cause franchisees in our industry to delay construction of new restaurants and/or cause potential new franchisees to reconsider entering into franchise agreements. The extent of the impact may depend on our ability to increase our menu prices and the timing thereof.\nOur business and the growth of our Company are dependent on the skills and expertise of management and key personnel.\nDuring the upcoming stages of our Company\u2019s anticipated growth, we will be entirely dependent upon the management skills and expertise of our management and key personnel, including Michael Pruitt, our current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pruitt also sits on HOA\u2019s board of directors. The loss of services of Mr. Pruitt or other executive officers would dramatically affect our business prospects. Certain of our employees are particularly valuable to us because:\n\u25cf they have specialized knowledge about our company and operations;\n\u25cf they have specialized skills that are important to our operations; or\n\u25cf they would be particularly difficult to replace.\nIn the event that the services of Mr. Pruitt or any key management personnel ceased to be available to us, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nOur food service business, gaming revenues and the restaurant industry are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive and varied country, federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health, gambling and safety and zoning codes. We operate each of our locations in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses, it would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular location or group of restaurants.\nWe may be subject to significant foreign currency exchange controls in certain countries in which we operate.\nCertain foreign economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and their respective governments have adopted restrictions on the ability to transfer funds out of the country and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. This may increase our costs and limit our ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of certain countries. Any shortages or restrictions may impede our ability to convert these currencies into U.S. dollars and to transfer funds, including for the payment of dividends or interest or principal on our outstanding debt. In the event that any of our subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to us due to currency restrictions, we are responsible for any resulting shortfall.\nOur foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nWe expect most of our Hooters restaurants will be operated in foreign countries and territories outside of the U.S., and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, include political instability, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, changes in economic conditions (including wage and commodity inflation, consumer spending and unemployment levels), the regulatory environment, tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated. For example, it was discovered that our South African CFO had falsified audit documents and misappropriated funds. Although we have implemented various controls to prevent such misconduct from occurring in the future, this remains an inherent risk in doing business in a foreign country.\nIn addition, our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. More specifically, an increase in the value of the United States Dollar relative to other currencies, such as the Australian Dollar, the Brazilian Real, the British Pound, the Euro, and the South African Rand could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales.\nOur growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count. The successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees/partners to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis. We cannot guarantee that we, or our franchisees/partners, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably. Further, there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our, or our franchisees\u2019/partners\u2019, ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations, obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner and hire and train qualified personnel.\nOur franchisees/partners also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants. If it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees/partners to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, our planned growth could slow and our future revenue and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby. It is not our intention to open new restaurants that materially cannibalize the sales of our existing restaurants. However, as with most growing retail and restaurant operations, there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets over time.\nCurrent conditions in the global financial markets and the distressed economy may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to raise capital.\nOur business and results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally. The demand for our products could be adversely affected in an economic downturn and our revenues may decline under such circumstances. In addition, we may find it difficult, or we may not be able, to access the credit or equity markets, or we may experience higher funding costs in the event of adverse market conditions. Future instability in these markets could limit our ability to access the capital we require to fund and grow our business.\nChanges in financial accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.\nChanges in financial accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the new rules are required to be implemented. Many existing accounting standards require management to make subjective assumptions, such as those required for stock compensation, tax matters, franchise acquisitions, litigation, and asset impairment calculations. Changes in accounting standards or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nWe could be adversely impacted if our information technology and computer systems do not perform properly or if we fail to protect our customers\u2019 credit card information or our employees\u2019 personal data.\nWe rely heavily on information technology to conduct our business, and any material failure, interruption of service, or compromised data security could adversely affect our operations. While we expend significant resources to ensure that our information technology operates securely and effectively, any security breaches could result in disruptions to operations or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Additionally, if our customers\u2019 credit card or other personal information or our employees\u2019 personal data are compromised our operations could be adversely affected, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subjected to litigation or the imposition of penalties.\nAdverse weather conditions could affect our sales.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as regional winter storms, floods, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes, could affect our sales at restaurants in locations that experience these weather conditions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHealth concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of neurological diseases or other diseases or viruses, such as norovirus, influenza, H1N1, and the recent appearance of EBOLA. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has experienced price fluctuations and may continue to do so, resulting in a substantial loss in your investment.\nThe current market for our common stock has been characterized by volatile prices with minimal volume. Although we have our common stock listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or if it develops, it may not be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell our common stock and could depress the market price of the common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market can be highly volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock can be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly unpredictable and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our operating results and achievement of key business metrics;\n\u25cf changes in the global economy and in the local economies in which we operate;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing, if necessary;\n\u25cf the departure of any of our key executive officers and directors;\n\u25cf changes in the federal, state, and local laws and regulations to which we are subject;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, if any;\n\u25cf any differences between reported results and securities analysts\u2019 published or unpublished expectations;\n\u25cf market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf future sales of our securities;\n\u25cf announcements or press releases relating to the casual dining restaurant sector or to our own business or prospects;\n\u25cf regulatory, legislative, or other developments affecting us or the restaurant industry generally; and\n\u25cf market conditions specific to casual dining restaurant, the restaurant industry and the stock market generally.\nWe may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, which may limit the ability of stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. However, we might not continue to meet the criteria for continued listing of our common stock in the future. On September 9, 2012, NASDAQ placed a trading halt on our company, due to the misconduct of our previous South African CFO and subsequent discovery of his misallocation of funds and production of fraudulent audit documents. After completing a thorough audit and providing all documentation required by NASDAQ, we resumed trading on January 16, 2013. Although we have implemented controls designed to prevent misconduct, we cannot guarantee continued listing of our common stock in the future. A company having securities listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market must make all required filings on a timely basis with the SEC and also meet the qualitative and quantitative continued listing criteria of the NASDAQ Capital Market. In the event we are unable to meet this criteria and become delisted, quotations for trading of our common stock would likely be conducted in the over-the-counter markets. In such case, an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate market quotations for our common stock, either of which could result in a substantial loss of your investment.\nOur common stock could be further diluted as the result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options.\nIn the past, we have issued common stock, convertible securities (such as convertible notes) and warrants in order to raise capital. We have also issued common stock as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors. We have shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of additional common stock, convertible securities, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, could reduce the market price of our common stock or could result in adjustments to exercise prices of outstanding warrants (resulting in these securities becoming exercisable for, as the case may be, a greater number of shares of our common stock), or could obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our stockholders.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who have been non-affiliates for the preceding three months may sell shares of our common stock freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell shares of our common stock after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale, current public information and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWhile our public warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital.\nWe have warrants which are publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cHOTRW.\u201d During the term that the public warrants are outstanding, the holders of the public warrants will be given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional capital while these public warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these public warrants are likely to be exercised, we may be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms from other sources.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore investors should not anticipate cash dividends on their investment.\nOur board of directors does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but instead intends to retain any and all earnings to finance the growth of the business. To date, we have not paid any cash dividends and there can be no assurance that cash dividends will ever be paid on our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, which could depress the market price of our common stock and dilute your ownership.\nMarket sales of large amounts of our common stock, or the potential for those sales even if they do not actually occur, may have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, if our future financing needs require us to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, the amount of common stock available for resale could be increased which could stimulate trading activity and cause the market price of our common stock to drop, even if our business is doing well. Furthermore, the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nDirector and officer liability is limited.\nAs permitted by Delaware law, our bylaws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our bylaw provisions and Delaware law, stockholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.", "PERMNO": 13455, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BURG"}
