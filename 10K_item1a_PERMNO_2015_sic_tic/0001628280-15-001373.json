{"cik": "1128361", "company": "BBCN BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn the course of conducting its business operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to its own business. The following discussion addresses the most significant risks that could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline.\nEconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our loan portfolio and reduce the demand for our services. We focus our business primarily in Korean-American communities in California, the greater New York City, Chicago and Seattle metropolitan areas, New Jersey and Virginia. Adverse economic conditions in our market areas have had a material adverse impact on the quality of our business. A renewed economic slowdown in the markets in which we operate may have any or all of the following consequences, any of which may reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nthe level and duration of deposits may decline;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans may decline in value below the principal amount owed by the borrower.\nWe have a high level of loans secured by real estate collateral. A further downturn in the real estate market may seriously impair our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 80% of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by various types of real estate. There was a general slowdown in the economy and declines in value in the commercial real estate market in Southern California, along with high levels of unemployment. Renewed deterioration in the real estate market generally and in commercial real estate values in particular, along with high levels of unemployment, may result in additional loan charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, which may have a material and adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. If our actual loan losses exceed the amount we have allocated for estimated probable incurred losses, our business will be adversely affected. We attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans, but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business operations. We create allowances for estimated loan losses through provisions that are recorded as reductions in income in our accounting records. We base these allowances on estimates of the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical experience with our loans;\n\u2022\nevaluation of current economic conditions and other factors;\n\u2022\nreviews of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nreviews of delinquencies; and\n\u2022\nthe quality of the collateral underlying our loans.\nIf our allowance estimates are inadequate, we may incur losses, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and we may be required to raise additional capital to enhance our capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the adequacy of our allowance. These agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability. The interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. In general, the wider the spread, the more net interest income we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can greatly affect our income. In addition, interest rate fluctuations can affect how much money we may be able to lend. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.\nIf we lose key employees, our business may suffer. There is intense competition for experienced and highly qualified personnel in the Korean-American banking industry. Our future success depends on the continued employment of existing senior management personnel. If we lose key employees temporarily or permanently, it may hurt our business. We may be particularly hurt if our key employees, including any of our executive officers, became employed by our competitors in the Korean-American banking industry.\nEnvironmental laws may force us to pay for environmental problems. The cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems may increase our operating expenses. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, we often purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We also lease premises where our branches and other facilities are located, all where environmental problems may exist. Although we have lending, foreclosure and facilities guidelines that are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances may exist on some of the properties that we own, lease, manage or occupy. We may face the risk that environmental laws may force us to clean up the properties at our expense. The cost of cleaning up a property may exceed the value of the property. We may also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if we take a role in managing those operations after a default. We may find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties.\nWe are exposed to the risks of natural disasters. A significant portion of our operations is concentrated in Southern California, which is an earthquake-prone region. A major earthquake may result in material loss to us. A significant percentage of our loans are and will be secured by real estate. Many of our borrowers may suffer uninsured property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs after an earthquake. Those borrowers might not be able to repay their loans, and the collateral for such loans may decline significantly in value. Unlike a bank with operations that are more geographically diversified, we are vulnerable to greater losses if an earthquake, fire, flood, mudslide or other natural catastrophe occurs in Southern California.\nAn increase in nonperforming assets would reduce our income and increase our expenses. If the level of nonperforming assets increases in the future, it may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Nonperforming assets are mainly loans on which the borrowers are not making their required payments. Nonperforming assets also include loans that have been restructured to permit the borrower to make payments and real estate that has been acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of unpaid loans. To the extent that assets are nonperforming, we have less earning assets generating interest income and an increase in credit related expenses, including provisions for loan losses.\nWe may experience adverse effects from acquisitions. We have acquired other banking companies and bank offices in the past and consider additional acquisitions as opportunities arise. If we do not adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with acquisitions of other companies, we may incur material unexpected costs and disruption of our business. Future acquisitions may increase the degree of such risks.\nRisks involved in acquisitions of other companies include:\n\u2022\nthe risk of failure to adequately evaluate the asset quality of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other important business activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining good relations with the loan and deposit customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\namortization of expenses related to acquired intangible assets that have finite lives.\nLiquidity risks may impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities may be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that may detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow may also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry or the general financial services industry as a whole.\nIncreases in the level of our problem assets, occurrence of operating losses or a failure to comply with requirements of the agencies which regulate us may result in regulatory actions against us which may materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. The DBO, the FDIC and the FRB each have authority to take actions to require that we comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements, cease engaging in what they perceive to be unsafe or\nunsound practices or make other changes in our business. Among others, the corrective measures that such regulatory authorities may take include requiring us to enter into informal or formal agreements regarding our operations, the issuance of cease and desist orders to refrain from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, removal of officers and directors and the assessment of civil monetary penalties. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation\u201d for a further description of such regulatory powers.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes and their impacts on us can be hard to predict and may result in unexpected and materially adverse impacts on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of us, our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to operational risks relating to our technology and information systems. The continued efficacy of our technology and information systems, related operational infrastructure and relationships with third party vendors in our ongoing operations is integral to our performance. Failure of any of these resources, including but not limited to operational or systems failures, interruptions of client service operations and ineffectiveness of or interruption in third party data processing or other vendor support, may cause material disruptions in our business, impairment of customer relations and exposure to liability for our customers, as well as action by bank regulatory authorities.\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is very important for our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, and in the communities we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, our conduct of our business or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs we expand outside our California markets, we may encounter additional risks that may adversely affect us. Currently, the majority of our offices are located in California, but we also have offices in the New York City, Chicago and Seattle metropolitan areas, New Jersey and Virgina. Over time, we may seek to establish offices to serve Korean-American communities in other parts of the United States as well. In the course of these expansion activities, we may encounter significant risks, including unfamiliarity with the characteristics and business dynamics of new markets, increased marketing and administrative expenses and operational difficulties arising from our efforts to attract business in new markets, manage operations in noncontiguous geographic markets, comply with local laws and regulations and effectively and consistently manage our non-California personnel and business. If we are unable to manage these risks, our operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions in South Korea or globally may adversely affect our business. A substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to South Korea and, as a result, we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions there. If economic conditions in South Korea deteriorate, we may, among other things, be exposed to economic and transfer risk, and may experience an outflow of deposits by our customers with connections to South Korea. Transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity. This may materially and adversely impact the recoverability of investments in or loans made to such entities. Adverse economic conditions in South Korea may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region. In addition, a general overall decline in global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our profitability and overall results of operations\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make loans secured by real property does not ensure that the value of the real property collateral will be sufficient to repay our loans. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made and requires the exercise of a considerable degree of judgment. If the appraisal does not accurately reflect the amount that may be obtained upon sale or foreclosure of the property, whether due to a decline in property value after the date of the original appraisal or defective preparation of the appraisal, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property and as a result, we may suffer losses.\nChanges in governmental regulation may impair our operations or restrict our growth. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations. These areas include:\n\u2022\nthe capital that we must maintain;\n\u2022\nthe dividends that we may pay;\n\u2022\nthe kinds of activities that we may engage in;\n\u2022\nthe compensation that we may pay;\n\u2022\nthe kinds and amounts of investments that we can make;\n\u2022\nthe locations of our offices;\n\u2022\nhow much interest we can pay on demand deposits;\n\u2022\ninsurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance; and\n\u2022\nhow much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits.\nThe governmental supervision and regulations to which we are subject, which are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than our stockholders, may be changed at any time, and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change. Within the last several years, Congress and the federal bank regulatory authorities have made significant changes to these statutes and regulations. There can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business. The Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the DBO and the FDIC and BBCN Bancorp is subject to the rules and regulations of the FRB. In addition to governmental supervision and regulation, BBCN Bank and BBCN Bancorp are subject to changes in other federal and state laws, including changes in tax laws, which may materially affect the banking industry. If we fail to comply with federal and state bank regulations, the regulators may limit our activities or growth, fine us or force the bank into receivership.\nImplementation of the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other things: (i) the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; (ii) the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products that would affect banks and non-bank finance companies; (iii) the establishment of new capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies, including the elimination, with exceptions for banking organizations having assets of less than $10 billion, of the ability to treat trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital; (iv) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivatives, securitization and mortgage origination markets; (v) the elimination of proprietary trading and private equity investment activities by banks; (vi) the elimination of barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks; (vii) permanent establishment of the previously implemented temporary increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000 per insured account; (viii) the authorization of interest bearing transaction accounts and (ix) changes in the calculation of FDIC deposit insurance assessments and an increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the DIF.\nCertain provisions of the legislation are not immediately effective or are subject to required studies and implementing regulations. Further, community banks with less than $10 billion in assets (less than $15 billion with respect to trust preferred securities) are exempt from certain provisions of the legislation. We cannot predict how this significant new legislation may be interpreted and enforced nor how implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect us. There can be no assurance that these or future reforms will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may result in substantial losses for our stockholders. The market price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nissuing new equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our common stock outstanding and the trading volume of our stock;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial performance estimates of us or by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ncompetitive developments, including announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions that affect the Bank\u2019s performance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulations that affect the Bank.\nWe may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We periodically evaluate opportunities to access capital markets, taking into account our financial condition, regulatory capital ratios, business strategies, anticipated asset growth and other relevant considerations. It is possible that future acquisitions, organic growth or changes in regulatory capital requirements could require us to increase the amount or change the composition of our current capital, including our common equity. For all of these reasons and others, and always subject to market conditions, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other capital securities in public or private transactions.\nThe issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or other rights that would entitle them to purchase their pro\nrata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends in the future, as well as the ability of the Bank to make dividend payments to us, will be subject to regulatory, statutory and other restrictions. Our board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue payment of regular cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends at that time will be subject to statutory and other limitations applicable to us or to the Bank.\nOur results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of future impairment of our intangible assets. Future acquisitions could result in increases in the amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, at least annually in order to determine whether such assets are impaired. We make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to stockholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected and our reputation and operating results would be harmed. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures or difficulties encountered in their implementation may also result in regulatory enforcement action against us, adversely affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.", "PERMNO": 85741, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HOPE"}
