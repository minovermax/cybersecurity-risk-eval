{"cik": "99780", "company": "TRINITY INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those mentioned in forward-looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements, and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our Company. All known material risks and uncertainties are described below. The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nMany of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. We operate in cyclical industries. Downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products. Decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes, lower prices, and/or a loss of profits. The railcar, barge, and wind energy industries have previously experienced sharp cyclical downturns and at such times operated with a minimal backlog. The business cycles of our different operations may not typically coincide but an economic downturn could impact disparate cycles contemporaneously. In such cases, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business.\nVolatility in the global markets may adversely affect our business and operating results. Instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, fluctuations in commodity\nprices that our customers produce and transport, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers could lead to customers' requests for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders. Additionally such events could result in our customers' attempts to cancel orders in whole or in part or unilaterally terminate firm contracts resulting in un-remedied contract breaches or purchase order breaches, and increased commercial litigation costs. Such occurrences could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIf volatile conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit, product order volumes may decrease or customers may default on payments owed to us. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges obtaining credit, selling their products to customers that require purchasing credit, or otherwise operating their businesses, the supply of materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products may be interrupted. Any of these conditions or events could result in reductions in our revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLitigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition. We are currently, and may from time to time be, involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of our operations. Adverse judgments and outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in significant losses and costs that could weaken our financial condition. Although we maintain reserves for our reasonably estimable liability, our reserves may be inadequate to cover our portion of claims or judgments after taking into consideration rights in indemnity and recourse to third parties. Any such claims or judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or overall financial condition.\nIncreases in the price and demand for steel could lower our margins and profitability. The principal material used in our manufacturing segments is steel. Market steel prices may exhibit short periods of volatility. Steel prices may experience further volatility as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and other market factors. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of this volatility on our operating profits for the year. To the extent that we do not have such arrangements in place, an increase in steel prices could materially lower our profitability. In addition, meeting production demands is dependent on our ability to obtain a sufficient amount of steel. An unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules.\nWe have potential exposure to environmental liabilities, which may increase costs and lower profitability. We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to: (i) the release or discharge of materials into the environment at our facilities or with respect to our products while in operation; (ii) the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials; and (iii) other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts, but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations involving hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law.\nEnvironmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. Although we regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations, the risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies operating under environmental permits.\nHowever, future events, such as changes in, or modified interpretations of, existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with the manufacture of our products and related business activities and properties, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nIn addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by railcar, barge, or storage container raises potential risks in the event of an accident that results in the release of an environmentally sensitive substance. Generally, liability under existing laws for a derailment or other accident depends upon causation analysis and the acts, errors, or omissions, if any, of a party involved in the transportation activity, including, but not limited to, the railroad, the shipper, the buyer and seller of the substances being transported, or the manufacturer of the railcar, barge, or storage container, or its components. Additionally, the severity of injury or property damage arising from an incident may influence the causation responsibility analysis, exposing the Company to potentially greater liability. Under certain circumstances, strict liability concepts may apply and if we are found liable in any such incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries. We may not be able to sustain our market leadership positions, which may impact our financial results. We face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate. In addition to price, we face competition in product performance and technological innovation, quality, reliability of delivery, customer service, and other factors. This competition is often intense, the effects of which could reduce our revenues and operating profits, limit our ability to grow, increase pricing pressure on our products, and otherwise affect our financial results.\nThe limited number of customers in certain of our businesses, the variable purchase patterns of our customers in all our segments, and the timing of completion, delivery, and customer acceptance of orders may cause our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter, which would result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results. Some of the markets we serve are dominated by a limited number of customers. Customers in each of our business segments do not purchase a similar volume of products each year nor make purchases consistently from year-to-year. As a result, the order levels for our products have varied significantly from quarterly period to quarterly period in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future. Therefore, our results of operations in any particular quarterly period may be significantly affected. As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between quarterly periods may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nOur access to capital may be limited or unavailable due to deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets, weakening of macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in credit ratings. In general, the Company, and more specifically its leasing subsidiaries' operations, rely in large part upon banks and capital markets to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, a number of other factors could cause the Company to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. These factors include the Company's financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as determined primarily by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Fitch Ratings, Inc. If the Company is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, the Company's other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, and cash flow from operations may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt.\nWe may be unable to maintain railcar assets on lease at satisfactory rates. The profitability of our railcar leasing business depends on our ability to lease railcars at satisfactory rates, to re-lease railcars upon the expiration and non-renewal of existing leases, and to sell railcars in the secondary market as part of our ordinary course of business. Our ability to lease, re-lease or sell leased or unleased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe cost of and demand for leases or ownership of newer or specific-use railcar types;\n\u2022\nthe availability in the market generally of competing used or new railcars;\n\u2022\nthe degree of obsolescence of leased or unleased railcars, including railcars subject to regulatory obsolescence;\n\u2022\nthe prevailing market and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, interest rates, and inflation rates;\n\u2022\nthe market demand or governmental mandate for refurbishment; and\n\u2022\nthe volume and nature of railcar traffic and loadings\nA downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re-marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms or newer railcars, requiring us to re-market leased railcars more frequently. Furthermore, the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers. Our inability to re-lease or sell leased or unleased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease rates, lower lease utilization percentages, and reduced revenues.\nFluctuations in the price and supply of specialty and other component parts used in the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost-effectively manufacture and sell our products. In some instances, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components needed in our production. A significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty and other parts and components at competitive prices such as brakes, wheels, side frames, bolsters, and bearings for the railcar business, as well as flanges for the wind towers business. Our manufacturing operations partially depend on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials, parts, and components in acceptable quantities and quality from our suppliers. Certain parts and components of our products are currently available from a limited number of suppliers and, as a result, we may have limited control over pricing, availability, and delivery schedules. If we are unable to purchase a sufficient quantity of parts and components on a timely basis, we could face disruptions in our production and incur delays while we attempt\nto engage alternative suppliers. Fewer suppliers could result from unimproved or worsening economic or commercial conditions which could increase our rejections for poor quality and require us to source unknown and distant supply alternatives. Any such disruption or conditions could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nReductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs. We use various gases, including natural gas, at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment. An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the U.S. and any foreign power and, in particular, prolonged conflicts could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and/or natural gas, which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general. Hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and/or natural gas potentially resulting in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs. Speculative trading in energy futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost. Future limitations on the availability (including limitations imposed by increased regulation or restrictions on rail, road, and pipeline transportation of energy supplies) or consumption of petroleum products and/or an increase in energy costs, particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment, could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively.\nOur manufacturer's warranties expose us to product replacement and repair claims. Depending on the product, we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials (including surface coatings, primers, sealants, and interior linings), parts, and components pursuant to express limited contractual warranties. Accordingly, we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part, component or material is highly disproportionate to the original price. These types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls, significant repair or replacement costs, and damage to our reputation.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk. The nature of our business subjects us to product liability, property damage, and personal injury claims, especially in connection with products we manufacture that our customers install along US highways or that our customers use to transport hazardous, flammable, toxic, or explosive materials. Over the last several years, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries. Increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self-insured retention. If the number or severity of claims within our self-insured retention increases, we could suffer costs in excess of the reserves we maintain for the reasonably estimable liability in such claims or such number. Also the severity of such claims could expose us to uninsured damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons. While our liability insurance coverage is at or above levels based on commercial norms in our industries, an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims coupled with an unusually large damage award could exceed our liability insurance coverage. In addition, the availability of, and our ability to collect on, insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage, or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. Moreover, any accident or incident involving our industries in general or us or our products specifically, even if we are fully insured, contractually indemnified, or not held to be liable, could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future.\nMany of our products are sold to leasing companies, contractors, distributors, and installers who may misuse, abuse, improperly install or improperly or inadequately maintain or repair such products thereby potentially exposing the Company to claims that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition. The products we manufacture are designed to work optimally when properly operated, installed, repaired, and maintained. When this does not occur, the Company may be subjected to claims or litigation associated with injuries or property damage.\nRisks related to our operations outside of the U.S., particularly Mexico, could decrease our profitability. Our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to the risks associated with cross-border business transactions and activities. Political, legal, trade, economic change or instability, unrestrained criminal activities, or social unrest could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations, including the ability to hire and retain employees. Violence in Mexico associated with drug trafficking has not abated. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any of these risks, but we cannot predict the likelihood of future effects from such risks or any resulting adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Many items manufactured by us in Mexico are sold primarily in the U.S. and the transportation and import of such products may be disrupted. Some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety, railcar and railcar component part design, performance, and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems. If we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts and components within the various foreign countries where we operate, we may be unable to market and sell our railcars, parts, and components in those countries. In addition, unexpected changes in laws, rules, and regulatory requirements; tariffs and other trade barriers, including regulatory initiatives for buying goods produced in America;\nmore stringent or restrictive laws, rules, and regulations relating to labor or the environment; adverse tax consequences; and price exchange controls could limit operations affecting production throughput and making the manufacture and distribution of our products less timely or more difficult. Furthermore, any material change in the quotas, regulations, or duties on imports imposed by the U.S. government and agencies, or on exports by the government of Mexico or its agencies, could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in Mexico. Because we have operations outside the U.S., we could be adversely affected by final judgments of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or import/export rules and regulations and similar anti-corruption or import/export laws of other countries.\nEquipment failures or extensive damage to our facilities, including as might occur as a result of natural disasters, could lead to production, delivery, or service curtailments or shutdowns, loss of revenue or higher expenses. We operate a substantial amount of equipment at our production facilities, several of which are situated in tornado and hurricane zones and on navigable waterways in the U.S. An interruption in production capabilities or maintenance and repair capabilities at our facilities, as a result of equipment failure or acts of nature, including non-navigation orders resulting from low-water conditions issued from time to time by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on one or more U.S. rivers which serve our facilities, could reduce or prevent our production, delivery, service, or repair of our products and increase our costs and expenses. A halt of production at any of our manufacturing facilities could severely affect delivery times to our customers. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters. In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters, which may adversely affect our financial condition. Any significant delay in deliveries not otherwise contractually mitigated by favorable force majeure provisions could result in cancellation of all or a portion of our orders, cause us to lose future sales, and negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.\nBecause we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees, we may not be able to retain their services in the future. Our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees, none of whom currently have an employment agreement with us. Although we have historically been largely successful in retaining the services of our key management, we may not be able to do so in the future. The loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues.\nRepercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business. Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflict involving the U.S. or its interests abroad may adversely affect the U.S. and global economies, potentially preventing us from meeting our financial and other obligations. In particular, the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate. This could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials, parts, or components. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues, and costs.\nViolations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs. Our railcar manufacturing and leasing businesses are regulated by multiple governmental regulatory agencies such as the USEPA; the USDOT and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the FRA, PHMSA, and the Research and Special Programs Administration; and industry authorities such as the AAR. All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting railcar design, configuration, and mechanics; maintenance, and rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment, tracks, and operations, including the packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials. Future regulatory changes in the rail industry, including rules, regulations, and specifications mandating modified railcar designs, configurations, materials, and equipment could affect compliance costs and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nRecent derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various U.S. and Canadian regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as community governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. In July and August of 2014, PHMSA and TC, published notices of proposed rulemakings seeking interested party comments on potential regulatory initiatives pertaining to the transportation of flammable materials by rail. Regulatory certainty from PHMSA and TC is expected in 2015. While the regulatory process itself and the scope of any potential regulatory change is uncertain, any final rule or rules may or may not materially impact the rail industry as a whole; railroad operations; older and newer tank railcars that meet or exceed currently mandated PHMSA and TC standards; future tank railcar specifications; market decisions relative to capital investment in rail products; and the capability of the nation\u2019s railcar manufacturing, repair and maintenance infrastructure to implement mandated modification configurations or new construction. The Company cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from PHMSA\u2019s and TC's rulemaking processes will not be material to the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nOur Inland Barge operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard; the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board; the U.S. Customs Service; the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation; and private industry organizations\nsuch as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards.\nOur Construction Products Group is subject to regulation by the USDOT; the FHWA; and state highway departments and administrative agencies. These organizations establish certain standards, specifications, and product testing criteria related to the manufacture of our highway products. If our products were found to be not in compliance with these standards, specifications, or product testing criteria, or if additional testing criteria not previously contemplated by the applicable rules or regulations are required, we could be required to re-qualify our products for installation on state and national highways, recall products already in use or installed, or replace products in use or installed with other products manufactured by us or manufactured by our competitors.\nOur operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration. Although we believe we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities, claims that may be asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury, and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations.\nSome of our customers place orders for our products in reliance on their ability to utilize tax benefits or tax credits such as accelerated depreciation or the production tax credit for renewable energy, or to recover the cost of products acquired to comply with federal requirements or standards. There is no assurance that the U.S. government will reauthorize, modify, or otherwise not allow the expiration of such tax benefits, tax credits, or reimbursement policies, and in cases where such subsidies and policies are materially modified to reduce the available benefit, credit, or reimbursement or are otherwise allowed to expire, the demand for our products could decrease, thereby creating the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to reduce the value of our long-lived assets and/or goodwill, which would weaken our financial results. We periodically evaluate for potential impairment the carrying values of our long-lived assets to be held and used. The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. Impairment losses related to reductions in the value of our long-lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Under varying circumstances, we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities, although these measures, if and when implemented, may not be effective. Any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us.\nRailcars as a significant mode of transporting freight could decline, become more efficient over time, experience a shift in types of modal transportation, and/or certain railcar types could become obsolete. As the freight transportation markets we serve continue to evolve and become more efficient, the use of railcars may decline in favor of other more economic transportation modalities or the number of railcars needed to transport current or an increasing volume of goods may decline. Features and functionality specific to certain railcar types could result in those railcars becoming obsolete as customer requirements for freight delivery change or as regulatory mandates are promulgated that affect railcar design, configuration, and manufacture.\nBusiness, regulatory, and legal developments regarding climate change may affect the demand for our products or the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. We have followed the current debate over climate change in general, and the related science, policy discussion, and prospective legislation. Additionally, the potential challenges and opportunities for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed. However, any such challenges or opportunities are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industries. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the Company's operations or opportunities. Potential opportunities could include greater demand for wind towers and certain types of railcars, while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of railcars and higher energy costs. Further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape.\nChanges in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and our independent registered public accounting firm) may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. For a further discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShortages of skilled labor could adversely impact our operations. We depend on skilled labor in the manufacture, maintenance, and repair of our products. Some of our facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled laborers may exceed supply. Shortages of some types of skilled laborers, such as welders, could restrict our ability to maintain or increase production rates and could increase our labor costs.\nSome of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our operations in the U.S. and all of our operations in Mexico. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. We cannot be assured that our relations with our workforce will remain positive or that union organizers will not be successful in future attempts to organize at some of our facilities. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, we could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with lay-offs, shutdowns or reductions in the size and scope of our operations or difficulties of restarting our operations that have been temporarily shuttered.\nFrom time to time we may take tax positions that the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions may contest. We have in the past and may in the future take tax positions that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other taxing jurisdictions may challenge. We are required to disclose to the IRS as part of our tax returns particular tax positions in which we have a reasonable basis for the position but not a \"more likely than not\" chance of prevailing. If the IRS successfully contests a tax position that we take, we may be required to pay additional taxes or fines which may not have been previously accrued that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur inability to produce and disseminate relevant and/or reliable data and information pertaining to our business in an efficient, cost-effective, secure, and well-controlled fashion may have significant negative impacts on confidentiality requirements and obligations and proprietary needs and expectations and, therefore, our future operations, profitability, and competitive position. Management relies on information technology infrastructure and architecture, including hardware, network, software, people, and processes to provide useful and confidential information to conduct our business in the ordinary course, including correspondence and commercial data and information interchange with customers, suppliers, legal counsel, governmental agencies, and financial institution consultants, and to support assessments and conclusions about future plans and initiatives pertaining to market demands, operating performance, and competitive positioning. In addition, any material failure, interruption of service, compromised data security, or cybersecurity threat could adversely affect our relations with suppliers and customers, place us in violation of confidentiality and data protection laws, rules, and regulations, and result in negative impacts to our market share, operations, and profitability. Security breaches in our information technology could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential data or intellectual property which could adversely impact our future results.\nDiscord, conflict, and lack of compromise within and amongst the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government relative to federal government budgeting, taxation policies, government expenditures, and U.S. borrowing/debt ceiling limits could adversely affect our business and operating results. The legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government have encountered one or more impasses or deadlocks relative to federal government budgeting, tax revenue requirements, deficit spending, and management of short and long term U.S. government borrowing, debt ratings, and debt ceiling adjustments. Continuing impasse or deadlock could negatively impact U.S. domestic and global financial markets thereby reducing demand by our customers for our products and services and potentially result in reductions in our revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company could potentially fail to successfully integrate new businesses or products into its current business. The Company routinely engages in the search for growth opportunities, including assessment of merger and acquisition prospects in new markets and/or products. Any merger or acquisition in which the Company becomes involved and ultimately concludes is subject to integration into the Company's businesses and culture. If such integration is unsuccessful to any material degree, such lack of success could result in unexpected claims or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or overall financial condition.\nAdditional Information.
