{"cik": "1094831", "company": "BGC Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in shares of our Class A common stock, our 8.125% Senior Notes, our 5.375% Senior Notes, our 8.375% Senior Notes or our 5.125% Senior Notes or our other securities involves risks and uncertainties. The following are important risks and uncertainties that could affect our businesses, but we do not ascribe any particular likelihood or probability to them unless specifically indicated. Any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, should they occur, could significantly and negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and/or the trading price of our Class A common stock, our 8.125% Senior Notes, our 5.375% Senior Notes, our 8.375% Senior Notes, our 5.125% Senior Notes or our other securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY\nGlobal Economic and Market Conditions\nOur businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects have been and may continue to be affected both positively and negatively by conditions in the global economy and financial and commercial real estate markets generally.\nOur businesses and results of operations have been and may continue to be affected both positively and negatively by conditions in the global economy and financial and commercial real estate markets generally. Difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our businesses. Such conditions and uncertainties include fluctuating levels of economic output, interest and inflation rates, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, and fiscal and monetary policy. Economic policies of the new administration and Congress, potential increases in interest rates and proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans may change the regulatory and economic landscape. These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global markets that may have a positive or negative effect on our operating results, including the levels of trading, investing, and origination activity in the securities and derivatives markets, the valuations of financial instruments, unexpected changes in interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in volume and commissions on securities and derivatives transactions, the absolute and relative level of currency rates, commercial real estate values in absolute terms and relative to other investing options, the volume of real estate transactions, and the actual and the perceived quality of issuers, borrowers and investors. For example, the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nOn a consolidated basis, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 58% of our total revenues were generated by our Financial Services segment and 41% of our total revenues were generated by our Real Estate Services segment, with 1% generated within the corporate category. As a result, our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of low trading volume in the financial markets in which we offer our products and services and may be similarly impacted by downturns in the commercial real estate markets.\nThe global financial services and the commercial real estate markets are, by their nature, risky and volatile and are directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and global financial services and commercial real estate markets, resulting in reduced transactional volume and profitability for our businesses. These factors include:\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical conditions and uncertainties in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in the world, including government deficits, debt and possible defaults, austerity measures, changes in interest rates, and changes in central bank and/or fiscal policies, including the level and timing of government debt issuances, purchases and outstanding amounts;\n\u2022\npossible political turmoil with respect to the U.S. government, the European Union and/or its member states, China, or other major economies around the world,;\n\u2022\nthe effect of Federal Reserve Board and other central banks\u2019 monetary policies, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nterrorism, war and other armed hostilities;\n\u2022\ninflation, deflation and wavering institutional and consumer confidence levels;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital for borrowings and investments by our clients and their customers;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and trading in certain equity, debt and commodity markets;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of the difference between the yields on corporate securities being traded and those on related benchmark securities, which we refer to as \u201ccredit spreads\u201d;\n\u2022 the difference between government benchmark yields and/or investment-grade corporate debt versus the rate of return on commercial real estate investments based on the net income that the investments are expected to generate (known as the \u201ccapitalization rate\u201d or \u201ccap rate\u201d;\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate values and transaction volumes; and\n\u2022\nmargin requirements, capital requirements, credit availability, and other liquidity concerns with respect to our Financial Services segment, its clients, and the customers or its clients.\nLow transaction volumes for any of our brokerage asset classes generally result in reduced revenues. Under these conditions, our profitability is adversely affected since many of our costs are fixed. In addition, although less common, some of our financial services or commercial real estate transaction revenues are determined on the basis of the value of transactions or on spreads. For these reasons, substantial decreases in trading volume, declining prices, and/or reduced spreads could have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse effects on financial and commercial real estate markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world. This in turn could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Because of the unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent. Additionally, the negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from further sovereign debt matters with respect to the EU and/or its member states, Japan, or other major economies could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Concerns about the sovereign debt of certain major economies have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally, and continued uncertainties loom over the outcome the various governments\u2019 financial support programs and the possibility that EU member states or other major economies may experience similar financial troubles. Any downgrades of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. or additional sovereign debt crises in major economies could cause disruption and volatility of financial markets globally and have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOver the past year, concerns over slowing growth in China, the longer term declines in world-wide commodities prices relative to their 2008 and 2011 highs, especially for oil, and unusual changes in volatility in various securities and derivatives markets have led to uncertainties about the stability of financial markets and the likely responses of governments and central banks. Any one of these factors, or others, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA UK exit from the European Union could materially adversely impact our customers, and counterparties, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn June 23, 2016, UK citizens voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. The consequences of such a vote, and the possible exit of the UK, together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of any exit could significantly impact the business environment in which we and our customers and counterparties operate, introduce significant new uncertainties in financial markets, and create significant uncertainties with respect to legal and regulatory requirements and environments to which we and our customers and counterparties are subject. The UK vote to leave the E.U. has already generated some market volatility, along with a significant drop in the value of the British pound. Although market volatility generally benefits our Financial Services businesses, additional market and/or currency volatility or a reduction in trading in certain products may adversely impact customer and investor confidence. The UK vote to leave the E.U. may result in similar referendums or votes in other E.U. countries in which we do business. Further, the lack of precedent means that it is unclear how UK businesses\u2019 access to the E.U. Single Market and how the wider trading, legal and regulatory environments would be impacted, and hence how this could affect our businesses or those of our customers and counterparties over the medium to long term. Although we continue to have regulated entities and offices in place in many of the major European markets, during a transitional period - when the terms of the UK exit will be negotiated, and beyond - these and other risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our customers, and counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEvolving Business Environments\nWe operate in rapidly evolving business environments. If we are unable to adapt our businesses effectively to keep pace with these changes, our ability to succeed will be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe pace of change in the industries in which we operate is extremely rapid. Operating in such rapidly changing business environments involves a high degree of risk. Our ability to succeed will depend on our ability to adapt effectively to these changing conditions. If we are unable to keep up with rapid changes, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our proprietary software, network distribution systems and technologies. Our business environments are characterized by rapid technological changes, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing proprietary technology and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022\ndevelop, license and defend intellectual property useful in our businesses;\n\u2022\nenhance our existing products and services;\n\u2022\ndevelop new products and services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective customers;\n\u2022\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis;\n\u2022\nrespond to the demand for new products, services and technologies on a cost-effective and timely basis; and\n\u2022\nadapt to technological advancements and changing standards to address the increasingly sophisticated requirements and varied needs of our customers and prospective customers.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing conditions or customer requirements. In our Financial Services businesses, the development of proprietary electronic trading technology entails significant technical, financial and business risks. Further, the adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify, adapt and defend our technology. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards, or that we will be able to successfully defend any challenges to any technology we develop. Any failure on our part to anticipate or respond adequately to technological advancements, customer requirements or changing industry standards, or any significant delays in the development, introduction or availability of new products, services or technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nGeographic Concentration\nOur businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by any adverse change in the regions in which we operate.\nHistorically, our business operations have been substantially located in the U.S. and the U.K. While we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas, we are still highly concentrated in these areas. Because we derived approximately 59% and approximately 24%, respectively, of our total revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2016 from our operations in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively, our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these countries. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Real Estate Services Separation, IPO and Distribution\nOverview\nOur proposed plan to separate our Real Estate Services business into a separate public company is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and will involve significant time and expense and management attention, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn February 9, 2017, we announced that we had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the SEC relating to the proposed initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) of the Class A common stock of a newly formed subsidiary (\u201cNewco\u201d) that will hold our Real Estate Services business. The IPO is part of our plan to separate our Real Estate Services business into a separate public company (the \u201cSeparation\u201d). We further announced that, following some period after the IPO, we may, subject to market and other conditions, distribute the shares that we will hold of Newco pro rata to our stockholders in a manner intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the \u201cDistribution\u201d).\nAs described in more detail below, each of the Separation, IPO and Distribution is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any of them will be completed in accordance with the expected plans or timeline, or whether any of them will achieve their anticipated benefits. Furthermore, each of the Separation, IPO and Distribution will involve significant time, expense and management attention. Any of these factors or others could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Separation and IPO\nWe may experience difficulty in separating the assets and resources of our Real Estate Services business.\nWe may face difficulty in separating the assets and resources of our Real Estate Services business from the rest of our assets and resources. Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed if we incur unexpected costs or delays in connection with the Separation and IPO. In addition, as the majority stockholder of Newco, we could be adversely affected if the assets and resources of Newco are insufficient on a standalone basis, or if Newco encounters difficulties in acquiring or integrating additional assets or resources to conduct its business.\nThe Separation and IPO may adversely affect our businesses, and we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation and IPO.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits to us and our Real Estate Services business that are anticipated to result from the Separation and IPO, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These anticipated benefits include the following:\n\u2022\nimproving strategic planning, increasing management focus and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility for each of us and our Real Estate Services business to separately implement our respective strategic plans and to respond more effectively to different customer needs and changing economic environments;\n\u2022\nallowing each of our Financial Services business and Real Estate Services business to adopt a capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to its respective financial profile and business needs, as well as resolving the current competition for capital among our various businesses; and\n\u2022\nfacilitating acquisitions by our newly public subsidiary through the use of its Class A common stock as acquisition currency.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons. There also can be no assurance that the Separation and IPO will not adversely affect our businesses or the business of Newco, which will remain our subsidiary immediately following the IPO.\nThe Separation and IPO may have the following additional risks and uncertainties:\n\u2022\nthe price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to developments relating to the Separation and IPO, or other actions or market speculation regarding the Separation and IPO;\n\u2022\nour financial results and the financial results of Newco may be harmed, and each of our and Newco\u2019s ability to execute effectively upon its respective business plans may be affected adversely, by the competing demands on management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\neach of us and Newco may be adversely affected by competition from larger companies and a loss of purchasing power as a result of the reduction in our size relative to our businesses prior to the Separation and IPO;\n\u2022\neach of us and Newco may encounter difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel during this process, or as a result of uncertainties generated by the process or any developments or actions relating to it;\n\u2022\neach of us and Newco may encounter difficulties obtaining sufficient debt financing to restructure its debt or to operate or expand its businesses, and each may incur a higher cost of capital as a result of the reduction of its asset base following the Separation and IPO;\n\u2022\na sufficiently active trading market for the shares of Newco may not develop or be sustained following the Separation and IPO, which may limit the liquidity and reduce the value of our investment in Newco and thereby adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\neach of us and Newco may incur substantial increases in general and administrative expense associated with the need to retain and compensate third-party consultants and advisors (including legal counsel); and\n\u2022\neach of us and Newco may encounter difficulties in maintaining relationships or arrangements with customers, key suppliers, and other parties as a result of the Separation.\nFurthermore, following the completion of the Separation and IPO and prior to the Distribution, our securities and other compliance obligations, including associated costs, will increase significantly as our Real Estate Services business will have independent reporting obligations and compliance and other related costs. Any of these factors or others could have a negative impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Distribution\nThe Distribution is subject to various additional risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or timeline, or at all, may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and will involve significant time and expense and management attention, any of which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAfter the completion of the Separation and IPO, we may, subject to market and other conditions, distribute the shares that we will hold of Newco pro rata to our stockholders in the Distribution, which is intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Distribution may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or timeline, or at all, may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and will involve significant time and expense and management attention, any of which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, in connection with the Distribution:\n\u2022\nthe price of our Class A common stock, as well as the Class A common stock of Newco, could fluctuate significantly in response to developments relating to the Distribution or other action or market speculation regarding the Distribution or other transactions; and\n\u2022\nwe and Newco may experience delays or may fail to obtain our desired tax treatment, opinions or other approvals or clearances with respect to the Distribution.\nAny of these factors or others could have a negative impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf, following the completion of the Distribution, there is a determination that the Distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion with respect to the Distribution are incorrect, or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nIt is a condition to the Distribution that we receive an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Newco regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for any other reasons. In addition, certain events occurring after the Distribution may not be in our control, including certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or Newco after the Distribution. If the Distribution or a related transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Any such liabilities could be substantial, and could have a negative impact on our financial results and operations.\nNew Opportunities/Possible Transactions and Hires\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new product and service and market opportunities, including through hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nAs more participants enter the markets in which we operate, the resulting competition often leads to lower commissions and fees. This may result in a decrease in revenues in a particular market even if the volumes, prices, or spreads of transactions we handle in that market increases. As a result, our strategy is to broker more transactions, manage more properties and increase market share in existing markets and to seek out new customers and markets. We may face enhanced risks as these efforts to expand our businesses result in our transacting with a broader array of customers and counterparties and expose us to new products and services and markets. Pursuing this strategy may also require significant management attention and hiring expense and potential costs and liability in any litigation or\narbitration that may result. We may not be able to attract new customers or brokers, salespeople, managers, or other professionals or successfully enter new markets. In addition, we may be prevented or limited from hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers or other professionals for some period by contract or by regulatory restrictions or limitations. If we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new products and services and market opportunities, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to hiring brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals, we may pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or other opportunities, which could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute our stockholders. We may also face competition in our acquisition strategy, as well as potential regulatory restrictions or limitations, which may limit our number of strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities. Such transactions may materially adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have explored a wide range of strategic alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures with other financial and real estate services firms, including maintaining or developing relationships with independently owned offices in our Real Estate Services businesses, and with other companies that have interests in businesses in which there are brokerage, management, or other strategic opportunities. We also may make acquisitions outside of our existing industries, such as we did when we first entered the commercial real estate business beginning in 2011 with our acquisitions of Newmark and Grubb & Ellis and a recent agreement to acquire an insurance broker.\nWe continue to evaluate and potentially pursue possible strategic alliances, acquisitions, and joint ventures in both of our business segments and to explore opportunities in other industries. Such transactions may be necessary in order for us to enter into or develop new products or services or markets, as well as to strengthen our current ones.\nStrategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and new hires involve a number of operational, regulatory, and financial risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing businesses and product and service and market development and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining and integrating personnel and integrating administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control, compliance, and other systems;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of hiring additional management and other critical personnel and integrating them into current operations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\npotential dependence upon, and exposure to liability, loss or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control;\n\u2022\naddition of business lines in which we have not previously engaged;\n\u2022\npotential unfavorable reaction to our strategic alliance, acquisition or joint venture strategy by our customers;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we pursue opportunities outside the U.S., exposure to political, economic, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country, including risks of possible nationalization and/or foreign ownership restrictions, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory and tax requirements, economic and/or political instability, geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world, exchange controls and other restrictive government actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities;\n\u2022\nthe upfront costs associated with pursuing transactions and recruiting personnel, which efforts may be unsuccessful;\n\u2022\nthe inability to complete proposed or announced transactions on the expected timetable, or at all, or the inability to meet anticipated objectives;\n\u2022\nconflicts or disagreements between any strategic alliance or joint venture partner and us;\n\u2022\nexposure to additional liabilities of any acquired business, strategic alliance or joint venture; and\n\u2022\ndilution resulting from any issuances of shares of our Class A common stock or limited partnership units in connection with strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or new hires.\nWe expect to face competition for acquisition targets, which may limit our number of acquisitions and growth opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices or other less favorable terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational, regulatory or financial difficulties.\nIn addition, the acquisition of regulated firms generally requires the consent of the home jurisdiction regulator in which the target is domiciled and those jurisdictions in which the target has regulated subsidiaries. In certain circumstances one or more of these regulators may withhold their consent, impose restrictions or make their consent subject to conditions which may result in increased costs or delays.\nIn both of our business segments, any future growth will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable transactional candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these transactions. Future transactions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include payment of break-up fees, assumption of liabilities, including compensation, severance and lease termination costs, and transaction and deferred financing costs, among others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such transactions will be accretive or generate favorable operating margins. The success of these transactions will also be determined in part by the ongoing performance of the acquired companies and the acceptance of acquired employees of our partnership compensation structure and other variables which may be different from the existing industry standards or practices at the acquired companies.\nManagement will need to successfully manage the integration of recent acquisitions and future growth effectively. The integration and additional growth may place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Additionally, managing future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations, markets and business lines, including the anticipated entry into the insurance brokerage business pursuant to a recent acquisition agreement. As a result of these risks and challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or new hires. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLiquidity, Funding and Indebtedness\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses, and insufficient liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. Failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our trading businesses, and perceived liquidity issues may affect the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us in both of our operating segments. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties, other third parties or us, or a decrease in the market value of marketable securities held on our balance sheet.\nWe are a parent holding company with no direct operations. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating subsidiaries. We do not have any material assets other than our direct and indirect ownership in the equity of our subsidiaries, BGC U.S. and BGC Global, and their respective operating subsidiaries. As a result, our operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. In addition, we are dependent on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to any of our subsidiaries, we, as an equity owner of such subsidiary, and therefore holders of our securities, including our notes, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors, and any preferred equity holders. Any dividends declared by us, any payment by us of our indebtedness or other expenses, and all applicable taxes payable in respect of our net taxable income, if any, are paid from cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations, and self-regulatory organization rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to a parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to meet our obligations. Certain debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral. To the extent that we need funds to pay dividends, repay indebtedness and meet other expenses, or to pay taxes on our share of BGC U.S.\u2019s and BGC Global\u2019s net taxable income, and either BGC U.S. or BGC Global or their respective subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law, regulations, or agreements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including our ability to raise additional funding, including through access to the debt and equity capital markets.\nOur ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity capital markets, or to access secured lending markets, has in the past been and could in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international economy and markets, with the cost and availability of funding adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. To the extent we are not able to access the debt capital markets on acceptable terms in the future, we may seek to raise funding and capital through equity issuances or other means.\nFuture turbulence in the U.S. and international economy and markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain customers and counterparties to do business with each other or with us. Acquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access capital markets on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowing in the interim, which in turn may adversely affect the interest rates on our debt and our credit ratings and associated outlooks.\nOur funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity, notes payable and collateralized borrowings), shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth of specific assets and/or our Financial Services business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We generally have had limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our Financial Services segment. We may, however, need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, financing acquisitions, conducting operations, hiring or retaining brokers, providing liquidity and funding fails, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. A significant portion of our cash is held in our largest regulated entities, and we believe that cash in and available to these entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations such as margin or funding fails.\nIn our Real Estate Services segment, we generally have had limited need for short-term unsecured funding. We may, however, have need to access short-term capital sources in order to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, financing acquisitions, conducting operations or hiring or retaining real estate brokers, salespeople, managers, and other professionals. Our inability to secure such short-term capital may have an adverse impact on our Real Estate Services business.\nWe have debt, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and activities, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industries, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness, which at January 31, 2017 included $112.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes, $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes assumed in the acquisition of GFI, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes and $16.2 million in collateralized debt, has important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or sell equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service, strategic initiatives or other obligations or purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy, the markets, regulatory requirements, our operations or businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in the economy or our businesses; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt on terms acceptable to us.\nIn our Financial Services businesses, we are dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and sufficient regulatory capital and clearing margin. Clearing margin is the amount of cash, guarantees or similar collateral that we must provide or deposit with our third-party clearing organizations in support of our obligations under contractual clearing arrangements with these organizations. Historically, these needs have been satisfied from internally generated funds and proceeds from debt and equity financings. We have also relied on Cantor\u2019s support to clear our transactions in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency products under the clearing agreement we entered into with Cantor in November 2008. Although we have historically been able to raise debt on acceptable terms, if for any reason we need to raise additional funds, including in order to meet regulatory capital requirements and/or clearing margin requirements arising from growth in our brokerage businesses, to complete acquisitions or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain additional financing when needed. If we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our businesses, take advantage of future growth opportunities or respond to competitive pressure or unanticipated requirements.\nOur acquisitions may require significant cash resources and may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness.\nOur acquisitions, such as that of GFI or other potential future acquisitions, may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness. On January 12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100 percent of GFI\u2019s outstanding shares. In December 2014, we issued our 5.375% Senior Notes in anticipation of the tender offer which initiated such acquisition. As part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of GFI 8.375% Senior Notes due July 2018, and $60.0 million in short-term borrowings related to a GFI credit facility, which has since been repaid. In addition, on March 13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which we pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% and matures on April 1, 2019. On May 27, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $300 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021. Partially offsetting these increases to our indebtedness, on April 13, 2015, our $150.0 million of 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes, due April 15, 2015, were fully converted into approximately 24.0 million shares of our Class A common stock, which were issued to Cantor. Additionally, on July 13, 2016, certain holders of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the \u201c4.5% Convertible Notes\u201d) converted $68.0 thousand in principal amount of notes in exchange for 6,909 shares of our Class A common stock and on July 15, 2016, we repaid the remaining approximately $159.9 million principal amount of the 4.5% Convertible Notes. Further, in December 2015 we completed the sale of our Trayport business in exchange for 2,527,658 shares of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (\u201cICE\u201d) common stock, of which 2,459,737 shares have been sold as of February 24, 2017. We may also enter into other short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with similar acquisitions which may occur from time to time. In addition, in connection with the GFI acquisition, we incurred substantial non-recurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption of liabilities and expenses, and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses in connection with other acquisitions. The increased level of our consolidated indebtedness in connection with the GFI acquisition or other potential acquisitions may restrict our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, and such leverage, and any resulting liquidity or credit issues, could have a material adverse effect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. This risk may be further impacted by the planned separation of BGC\u2019s real estate service business into a separate public company announced on February 9, 2017.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed herein.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing our 8.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes, 5.125% Senior Notes and 8.375% Senior Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt (with certain exceptions, including to the extent already secured), recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our debt instruments that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our debt when due.\nWe may not have the funds necessary to repurchase the 8.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 5.125% Senior Notes or the 8.375% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event as required by the indentures governing these notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d (as defined in the indentures governing the 8.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes and the 8.375% Senior Notes), unless we have exercised our right to redeem such notes, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their notes at a price in cash equal to 100% of the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient, available financial resources, or would be able to arrange financing, to repurchase the 8.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 5.125% Senior Notes or the 8.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event.\u201d A failure by us to repurchase the notes when required would result in an event of default with respect to the notes. In addition, such failure may also constitute an event of default and result in the effective acceleration of the maturity of our other then-existing indebtedness.\nThe requirement to offer to repurchase the 8.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 5.125% Senior Notes and the 8.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe requirement to offer to repurchase the 8.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 5.125% Senior Notes and the 8.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and/or the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors in our Class A common stock.\nIntellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our businesses.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our intellectual property, including our proprietary technology. We generally rely primarily on trade secret, contract, patent, copyright, and trademark law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to proprietary technologies, products, services or methods, and our brand. For example, we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development, and we are currently pursuing patent applications around the world. We also control access to our proprietary technology, and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.\nIt is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights despite our precautions. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. We cannot ensure that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to protect our competitive\nadvantages or that any particular patent, copyright, or trademark is valid and enforceable, and all patents ultimately expire. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the U.S., or at all. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our businesses or our ability to compete. For example, reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our revenues.\nMany companies, including those in the computer and financial services industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and sometimes file lawsuits based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, there has been a proliferation of patents applicable to these industries and a substantial increase in the number of such patent applications filed. Under current law, U.S. patent applications typically remain secret for 18 months or, in some cases, until a patent is issued. Because of technological changes in these industries, patent coverage, and the issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of our products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves, there can be no assurance that we will be aware of all patents, copyrights or trademarks that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. Generally, it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future rights of others.\nAccordingly, we may face claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights that could interfere with our ability to use intellectual property or technology that is material to our businesses. In addition, restrictions on the distribution of some of the market data generated by our brokerage desks could limit the comprehensiveness and quality of the data we are able to distribute or sell. The number of such third-party claims may grow. Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims or rights against their use.\nWe may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such claims or litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, and the attention of management, any of which could materially negatively affect our businesses. Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement, stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages on our own behalf or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and may cause our operating margins to decline.\nIf our licenses from third parties are terminated or adversely changed or amended or contain material defects or errors, or if any of these third parties were to cease doing business or if products or services offered by third parties were to contain material defects or errors, our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected.\nWe license technology, databases and software from third parties, much of which is integral to our systems and our businesses. The licenses are terminable if we breach our obligations under the license agreements. If any material licenses were terminated or adversely changed or amended, if any of these third parties were to cease doing business or if any licensed technology, databases or software licensed by these third parties were to contain material defects or errors, we may be forced to spend significant time and money to replace the licensed technology, software and databases, and our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected. Further, any errors or defects in third-party services or products (including hardware, software, databases, cloud computing and other platforms and systems) or in services or products that we develop ourselves, could result in errors in, or a failure of our services or products, which could harm our business. Although we take steps to locate replacements, there can be no assurance that the necessary replacements will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will have an ongoing license to use all intellectual property which our systems require, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDefects or disruptions in our technology or services could diminish demand for our products and service and subject us to liability.\nBecause our technology, products and services are complex and use or incorporate a variety of computer hardware, software and databases, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our technology, products and services may have errors or defects. Errors and defects could result in unanticipated downtime or failure, and could cause financial loss and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time found defects and errors in our technology, products and service and defects and errors in our technology, products or services may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our technology, products and services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption for other customers. Furthermore, as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies, products and services, and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our technology, products and services. Since our customers use our technology, products and services for important aspects of their business and for financial transactions, any errors, defects, or disruptions in such technology, products and services or other performance problems with our technology, products and services could subject our customers to financial loss and hurt our reputation.\nIT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks\nIf we experience computer systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our business operations could be materially harmed.\nIf we experience computer systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our business operations could be harmed. We support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks internally. Our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary, to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business operations.\nAlthough all of our business critical systems have been designed and implemented with fault tolerant and/or redundant clustered hardware and diversely routed network connectivity, our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate. Although we operate four geographically disparate main data centers, they could be subject to failure due to environmental factors, power outage and other factors. We may be subject to system failures and outages which might impact our revenues and relationships with customers. In addition, we will be subject to risk in the event that systems of our customers, business partners, counterparties, vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations, are subject to failures and outages.\nWe rely on various third parties for computer and communications systems, such as telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors. Our systems, or those of our third-party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following, which may not in all cases be covered by insurance:\n\u2022\nunanticipated disruptions in service to our customers;\n\u2022\nslower response times;\n\u2022\ndelays in our customers\u2019 trade executions;\n\u2022\nfailed settlement of trades;\n\u2022\nincomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades;\n\u2022\nfinancial losses;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other customer claims; and\n\u2022\nregulatory actions.\nWe may experience additional systems or network failures in the future from power or telecommunications failures, acts of God or war, weather-related events, terrorist attacks, human error, natural disasters, fire, power loss, sabotage, cyber-attacks, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Any system or network failure that causes an interruption in products or services or decreases the responsiveness of our service, including failures caused by customer error or misuse of our systems, could damage our reputation, business and brand name.\nMalicious cyber-attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties.\nOur businesses require us to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. Developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating and compliance systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including malicious cyber-attack or other adverse events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services or products.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our customers\u2019 information, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties including outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within us. Given the high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber-attack on or breach of our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks in recent years in various industries, including ours, and cyber security risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators. If one or more cyber-attacks occur, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019, operations, which could\nresult in reputational damage, financial losses, customer dissatisfaction and/or regulatory penalties, which may not in all cases by covered by insurance. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur financial services regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats, including the assessment of firms\u2019 vulnerability to cyber-attacks. In particular, regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies, practices and procedures; protecting firm networks and information; identifying and addressing risk associated with remote access to client information and fund transfer requests; identifying and addressing risks associated with customers business partners, counterparties, vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations; preventing and detecting unauthorized activities; adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches; and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents. While any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident, it would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls, including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions.\nNatural Disasters, Weather-Related Events, Terrorist Attacks, and Other Disruptions to Infrastructure\nOur ability to conduct our businesses may be materially adversely impacted by catastrophic events, including natural disasters, weather-related events, terrorist attacks, and other disruptions.\nWe may encounter disruptions involving power, communications, transportation or other utilities or essential services depended on by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business. This could include disruptions as the result of natural disasters, pandemics, or weather-related or similar events, such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, political instability, labor strikes or turmoil or terrorist attacks. For example, during 2012, our own operations and properties we manage for clients in the northeastern United States, and in particular New York City, were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, in some cases significantly.\nThese disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a result of events with a broader impact on the communities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or travel.\nSuch events can result in significant injuries and loss of life, which could result in material financial liabilities, loss of business and reputational harm. They can also impact the availability and/or loss of commercial insurance policies, both for our own businesses and for those customers whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the insurance buying programs we make available to them.\nThere can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant loss. Given that our employees are increasingly mobile and less reliant on physical presence in our offices, our disaster recovery plans increasingly rely on the availability of the Internet (including \u201ccloud\u201d technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Although we maintain insurance for liability, property damage and business interruption, subject to deductibles and various exceptions, no assurance can be given that our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will not be materially negatively affected by such events in the future.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Regulations; Climate Risks\nOur operations are affected by federal, state and/or local environmental laws in the jurisdictions in which we maintain office space for our own operations and where we manage properties for clients in our Real Estate businesses, and we may face liability with respect to environmental issues occurring at properties that we occupy or manage.\nVarious laws, rules and regulations restrict the levels of certain substances that may be discharged into the environment by properties and such laws, rules and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real estate owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. We may face costs or liabilities under these laws as a result of our role as an on-site property manager. While we believe that we have taken adequate measures to prevent any such losses, no assurances can be given that these events will not occur. Within our own operations, we face additional costs from rising costs of environmental compliance, which make it more expensive to operate our corporate offices.\nOur operations are generally conducted within leased office building space, and, accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that regulations restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases, or taxes that may be imposed on their release, would result in material costs or capital expenditures. However, we cannot be certain about the extent to which such regulations will develop as there are higher levels of understanding and commitments by different governments in the United States and around the world regarding risks related to the climate and how they should be mitigated. Regulations relating to climate change may affect the scope of services we provide to clients in their managed properties, but we expect that clients would typically bear any additional costs of doing so under applicable management agreements.\nWe anticipate that the potential effects of climate change may impact the decisions and analysis the employees in our Real Estate businesses make with respect to the properties they evaluate or manage on behalf of clients since climate change considerations may impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring the properties. Future legislation that requires specific performance levels for building operations could make non-compliant buildings more expensive, which could materially adversely affect investments in properties we have made on behalf of clients.\nKey Personnel and Employees\nOur ability to retain our key employees and the ability of certain key employees to devote adequate time to us are critical to the success of our businesses, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur people are our most important resource. We must retain the services of our key employees and strategically recruit and hire new talented employees to attract customer transactions that generate most of our revenues.\nHoward W. Lutnick, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, is also the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cantor and President of CFGM, the managing partner of Cantor. Stephen M. Merkel, who serves as our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, is employed as Executive Managing Director, General Counsel and Secretary of Cantor. In addition, Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel also hold offices at various other affiliates of Cantor. These two key employees are not subject to employment agreements with us or any of our subsidiaries.\nCurrently, Mr. Lutnick and Mr. Merkel each spends approximately 50% of his time on our matters, although these percentages may vary depending on business developments at us or Cantor or any of our or Cantor\u2019s affiliates. As a result, these key employees (and others in key executive or management roles whom we may hire from time to time) dedicate only a portion of their professional efforts to our businesses and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for them to spend a specific amount of their time with us and/or Cantor. These two key employees may not be able to dedicate adequate time to our businesses and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by their other professional obligations. In addition, these key employees\u2019 other responsibilities could cause conflicts of interest with us.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, which includes non-competition and other arrangements applicable to our key employees who are limited partners of BGC Holdings, may not prevent our key employees, including Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel, whose employment by Cantor is not subject to these provisions in the BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, from resigning or competing against us. In addition, our success in the Financial Services segment has largely been dependent on the efforts of Mr. Lutnick and our President, Shaun Lynn, and other executive officers. In the Real Estate Services segment, our success has similarly been dependent on efforts by Mr. Lutnick in connection with acquisitions and on an ongoing basis by officers such as Barry Gosin and other key employees, including some who have been hired in connection with these acquisitions. Should Mr. Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, control of us would likely pass to Cantor, and indirectly pass to the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is Mr. Lutnick), Cantor\u2019s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain with Mr. Lutnick. If any of our key employees in our Financial Services or Real Estate Services segments were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to Cantor that compete with our services or otherwise leave us, some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInternal Controls\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, our operations, reputation and stock price could suffer, we may need to restate our financial statements, and we may be delayed or prevented from accessing the capital markets.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable SEC rules and regulations that require an annual management report on our internal controls over financial reporting and an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls. The management report includes, among other matters, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nInternal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal controls. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to identify and remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls could affect our ability to prepare financial reports in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations, and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory, and financial risks, and integrate our acquired businesses. Similarly, we need to effectively manage any growth that we achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable internal control, financial reporting, and legal and regulatory requirements. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting requirements could result in restatement, delay or prevent us from accessing the capital markets, and harm our reputation and the market price for our Class A common stock.\nOngoing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as compliance with current and future regulatory control requirements, including those imposed or expected to be imposed by the FCA, may require significant expenses and divert management resources from our operations and could require a restructuring of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any such expenses, time reallocations, or restructuring could be disruptive and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSeasonality\nThe financial services and commercial real estate services markets in which we operate are generally affected by seasonality, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period.\nTraditionally, the financial markets around the world experience lower volume during the summer and at the end of the year due to a general slowdown in the business environment around holiday seasons, and, therefore, our transaction volume levels may decrease during those periods. The timing of local holidays also affects transaction volumes.\nWith respect to the commercial real estate industry, due to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, our commercial real estate business exhibits certain seasonality, with our revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. While the seasonality in our two segments may be offsetting, these factors could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe seasonality of our businesses makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations. To the extent that we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations or we are confronted with negative conditions that inordinately impact seasonal norms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Tax Regulations\nPossible Impact of Final Income Tax Regulations\nOn October 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final regulations regarding the treatment of certain related party corporate debt as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These regulations include provisions that may adversely affect the tax consequences of common transactions, including intercompany obligations and/or financing. These changes are expected to impact many companies in the financial services sector, including several of our customers and competitors. These regulations could have an adverse impact on our income tax position or could possibly cause us to change the manner in which we conduct certain financial activities in ways that impose other costs on us. Due to the short time these regulations have been in effect, we are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which these regulations would adversely affect our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nGeneral Financial Services Market Conditions\nConsolidation and concentration of market share in the banking, brokerage, exchange and financial services industries could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because we may not be able to compete successfully.\nIn recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and concentration of market share among companies in the banking, financial brokerage, exchange, and financial services industries, resulting in increasingly large existing and potential competitors, and increased concentration in markets dominated by some of our largest customers. In addition, some of our large broker-dealer customers, such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Credit Suisse have announced plans to further reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixed income, currency, and commodities. This is in addition to the drastic reductions in these businesses already completed by customers, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, and The Royal Bank of Scotland.\nThe combination of this consolidation and concentration of market share and the reduction by large customers of certain businesses may lead to increased concentration among our broker-dealer customers, which may reduce our ability to negotiate pricing and other matters with our customers and lower volumes. Additionally, the sales and trading global revenue market share has become increasingly concentrated over the past five years among five of the top investment banks across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities asset classes.\nWe also face existing and potential competition from large exchanges, which seek or may seek to migrate trading from the inter-dealer market to their own. Consolidation and concentration of market share are occurring in this area as well. For example, in recent years, BATS Global Markets acquired the foreign-exchange trading venue, Hotspot from KCG Holdings, while BATS itself announced plans to be acquired by CBOE. In addition, Deutsche Bourse and LSE Group announced their intention to merge; the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited acquired the London Metal Exchange; and ICE completed the acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Consolidation among exchanges may increase their financial resources and ability to compete with us.\nContinued consolidation and concentration of market share in the financial services industry and especially among our customers could lead to the exertion of additional pricing pressure by our customers, impacting the commissions and spreads we generate from our brokerage services. Further, the consolidation and concentration among exchanges, and expansion by these exchanges into derivative and other non-equity trading markets, will increase competition for customer trades and place additional pricing pressure on commissions and spreads. These developments have increased competition from firms with potentially greater access to capital resources than we have. Finally, consolidation among our competitors other than exchange firms could result in increased resources and product or service offerings for our competitors. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nActions taken by central banks in major global economies may have a material negative impact on our businesses.\nIn recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England, have involved quantitative easing or the buying and selling of currencies in the foreign exchange market. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve.\nFor example, as of January 1, 2017, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC interest rate products in the U.S. Although the Federal Reserve has ceased purchases, it continues to hold substantially all of the securities purchased. In addition, despite the recent increase in interest rates, the Federal Reserve may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term interest rates low by historical standards.\nRecently, central banks in other jurisdictions, including the EU, Japan and China, have undertaken quantitative easing and other steps aimed at reducing interest rates and stimulating their economies through monetary policy. In these jurisdictions also, interest rates are expected to remain low by historical standards for some time to come.\nSimilarly, global FX volumes were muted over various periods during the past several years, largely because certain major central banks, such as those in Japan and China, intervened to keep global currencies from appreciating, and because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade strategies less appealing for FX market participants. In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, which holdings will be less likely to be traded or hedged, thus reducing further transaction volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new requirements may also reduce their trading and hedging activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. Moreover, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny of their rates and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. These central banking policies may materially adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX operations.\nThe migration of OTC swaps to SEF markets may adversely impact volumes, liquidity and demand for our services in certain markets.\nBGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for \u201cmade available to trade\u201d products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM.\nAlthough we believe that BGC Derivative Markets, GFI Swaps Exchange and ELX are in compliance with applicable rules, no assurance can be given that this will always be the case, that the market for these products will not be less robust, that there may accordingly be less volume and liquidity in these markets, that there may be less demand for our services or the market in general or that the industry will not experience disruptions as customers or market participants transition to the rules associated with the Dodd-Frank Act. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, including any potential relaxation of rules and regulations, our businesses in these products could be significantly reduced and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by applicable regulations.\nEven after the award of permanent registration status to our SEFs, we will incur significant additional costs, our revenues may be lower than in the past and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by future events.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandated that certain cleared swaps (subject to an exemption from the clearing requirement) trade on either a DCM or SEF. SEF and DCM core principles relate to trading and product requirements, compliance and audit-trail obligations, governance and disciplinary requirements, operational capabilities, surveillance obligations and financial information and resource requirements. While these principles may or may not be permanently enforced, we do know that we will be subject to a more complex regulatory framework going forward, and that there will be significant costs to prepare for and to comply with these ongoing regulatory requirements and potential amendments. We will incur increased legal fees, personnel expenses and other costs, as we work to analyze and implement the necessary legal structure for full compliance with all applicable regulations. There will also be significant costs related to the development, operation and enhancement of our technology relating to trade execution, trade reporting, surveillance, compliance and back-up and disaster recovery plans designed to meet the requirements of the regulators.\nIn addition, it is not clear at this point what the impact of these rules and regulations will be on the markets in which we currently provide our SEF services. During the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules, the markets for cleared and non-cleared swaps may continue to be less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets and there may be less demand for our services.\nCertain banks and other institutions may continue to be limited in their conduct of proprietary trading and may be further limited from trading in certain derivatives. The new rules, including the proprietary trading restrictions for certain banks and other institutions, could materially impact transaction volumes and liquidity in these markets and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely impacted as a result.\nIf we fail to continue to qualify as a SEF under any of these conditions, we may be unable to maintain our position as a provider of execution and brokerage services in the markets for many of the OTC products for which we have traditionally acted as an intermediary. This would have a broad impact on us and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results operations and prospects.\nOur commodities derivatives activities, including those related to electricity, natural gas and environmental interests, subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and other risks that may result in our incurring significant costs and liabilities.\nWe engage in the brokerage of commodities derivatives, including those involving electric power and natural gas, and related products and indices. These activities subject us and our customers to extensive regulatory oversight, involving federal, state and local and foreign commodities, energy, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations and may result in our incurring significant costs and liabilities.\nWe or our clients may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities, including trading of electricity, natural gas, and environmental interests. New regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will impose significant new costs and new requirements on the commodities derivatives activities of us and our customers. Therefore, the overall reputation of us or our clients may be adversely affected by the current or future regulatory environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and fines for market participants.\nThe commodities-related activities of us and our clients are also subject to the risk of unforeseen catastrophic events, many of which are outside of our control, which could result in significant liabilities for us or our customers. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks, and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The occurrence of any of such\nevents may prevent us from performing under our agreements with customers, may impair our operations, and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm, which could have a material negative effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRegulatory/Legal\nThe financial services industry in which we operate is subject to significant regulation. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements on our regulated businesses, and a significant operating loss or any extraordinary charge against capital could materially adversely affect our ability to expand or, depending upon the magnitude of the loss or charge, even to maintain the current level of our businesses.\nMany aspects of our businesses, like those of other financial intermediary firms, are subject to significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and various other regulatory bodies have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of these entities\u2019 activities. Five of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC, Sunrise Brokers LLC and Mint are registered with the SEC and subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As Futures Commissions Merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d), BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and ATS. These entities are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months\u2019 operating costs.\nOur international operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers L.P., BGC European Holdings, L.P., GFI Brokers Limited, GFI Securities Limited and Sunrise Brokers LLP, which are based in the UK, are currently subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant change in recent years, and our UK businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory levels of capital than they have in the past.\nIn addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business, such as Australia, France and Hong Kong. These regulations often include minimum capital requirements, which are subject to change. Further, we may become subject to capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may enter.\nWe expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory minimums. Should we fail to maintain the required capital, we may be required to reduce or suspend our broker-dealer operations during the period that we are not in compliance with capital requirements, and may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing organizations of which we are a member, our ability to clear through those clearing organizations may be impaired, which may materially adversely affect our ability to process trades.\nIf the capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against capital, our operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. Our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to restrictions, which, in turn, could limit our ability to pay our indebtedness and other expenses, dividends on our Class A common stock, and distributions on our BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, and to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, and pursue strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities. It is possible that capital requirements may also be relaxed as a result of future changes in U.S. regulation, although no assurance can be given that such changes will occur. We cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing. No assurance can be given that required capital levels will remain stable or that we will not incur substantial expenses in connection with maintaining current or increased capital levels or engaging in business restructurings or other activities in response to these requirements.\nIn addition, financial intermediary firms such as ours are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts, including for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, and we will regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, these policies, controls and procedures may result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies, controls and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or customer claims.\nOur businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by new laws, rules or regulations or by changes in existing law, rules or regulations or the application thereof.\nThe financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for additional legislation further regulating the financial services industry are periodically introduced in the U.S., the EU and other geographic areas. Moreover, the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their rules and regulations, particularly as these agencies have increased the focus and intensity of their regulation of the financial services industry.\nChanges in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA, the U.S. Treasury, the FCA, the European Commission, the ESMA and other domestic and international regulators and self-regulatory organizations, as well as changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers and could result in restrictions in the way we conduct our businesses. For example, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SEC and the CFTC are continuing to review the nature and scope of their regulation and oversight of the government securities markets and U.S. markets. The final draft of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Level 2 Regulatory Technical Standards (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (\u201cESMA\u201d) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility, and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their respective domestic marketplaces. MiFID II may require us to carry out internal reorginzations and possibly apply for additional licenses. Therefore, uncertainties resulting from the possibility of additional legislation and/or regulation could materially adversely impact our businesses. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on business activity, suspension or expulsion from the industry, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us.\nSimilarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, once effective, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the application of the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business.\nOther regulatory initiatives include Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord), a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world\u2019s major economies by 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. As a result, their businesses, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected, which might cause them to do less business. Such potential impact could materially adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our Financial Services segment.\nFurther, the authorities of certain EU countries may from time to time institute changes to tax law that, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the U.S. has proposed a series of changes to U.S. tax law, some of which could apply to us. It is not possible to predict if any of these new provisions will be enacted or, if they are, what form they may take. It is possible that one or more of such provisions could negatively impact our costs and our effective tax rate, which would affect our after-tax earnings. If any of such changes to tax law were implemented and/or deemed to apply to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including on our ability to attract, compensate and retain executives and brokers.\nRepublican Party control of both the U.S. Presidency and Congress could result in changes in legislation, regulations and priorities, including a freeze and review of pending regulations and possible revisions or relaxation of other regulations or initiatives. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, it is possible that the existing regulatory framework may be amended, which amendments could have a positive or negative impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws and regulations might take may negatively impact trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. We believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals which may directly impact our businesses as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. Additionally, unintended consequences of the laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws, rules or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses restricts and limits our operations and activities and results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties, including fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses.\nThe financial services industry, including our businesses, is subject to extensive regulation, which is very costly. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect the holders of our stock, notes or other securities. These regulations will often serve to restrict or limit our operations and activities, including through capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, restrictions or limitations, and censure, suspension, or expulsion. Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations.\nFirms in the financial services industry, including us, have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA in the UK and other international regulators, have increased accordingly. This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty. From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our UK group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures, systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of UK regulated firms. Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or undertakings as to the status of the firm\u2019s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice, which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA\u2019s website. These activities have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant costs and remediation expenses, and possible disciplinary actions by the SEC, the CFTC, the FCA, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators and have impacted, and may impact in the future, our acquisitions of regulated businesses or entry into new business lines.\nThe brokerage and financial services industries in general face substantial regulatory and litigation risks that may result in damages as well as costs, and we may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our products and services are not regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMany aspects of our current businesses involve substantial risks of liability. The expansion of our businesses, including into new areas, imposes additional risks of liability.\nIn the normal course of business, we have been a party to investigations, administrative proceedings, lawsuits, arbitrations and other actions involving primarily claims for damages. Examinations, inspections, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas or other requests for information or testimony may cause us to incur significant expenses, including fees for legal representation and other professional advisors and costs associated with document production and remediation efforts. Such regulatory or other actions may also be directed at certain executives or employees who may be critical to our businesses or to particular brokerage desks. The risks associated with such matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nA settlement of, or judgment related to, any such matters could result in civil or criminal liability, penalties, fines, restrictions or limitations on our operations and activities and other sanctions and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any such action could also cause us significant reputational harm, which, in turn, could seriously harm us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of such matters, we may incur significant legal and other costs, including substantial management time, dealing with such matters, even if we are not a party to the litigation or a target of the inquiry.\nIn our Financial Services segment, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain customers. As a result, if our customers are not satisfied with our products or services, such dissatisfaction may be more damaging to our Financial Services businesses than to other types of businesses. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or cause significant reputational damage to us, which could seriously harm us.\nFinancial Services Competition\nBecause competition for the services of brokers is intense, it could affect our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled brokers or other professional services personnel, in turn adversely impacting our revenues, resulting in a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to provide high-quality brokerage and other professional services and maintain long-term relationships with our customers depends, in large part, upon our brokers and other professionals in both of our segments. As a result, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nIn recent years, we have significantly grown the number of brokers in our businesses through new hires and acquisitions of existing businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Competition for the services of brokers is intense, especially for brokers with experience in the specialized businesses in which we participate or we may seek to enter. If we are unable to hire or retain highly qualified brokers, including retaining those employed by businesses we acquire in the future, we may not be able to enter new brokerage markets or develop new products or services. If we lose one or more of our brokers in a particular market in which we participate, our revenues may decrease and we may lose market share.\nIn addition, recruitment and retention of qualified brokers could result in substantial additional costs. We have been and are currently a party to, or otherwise involved in, several lawsuits and arbitrations involving competitor claims in connection with employee hires and/or departures. We may also pursue our rights through litigation when competitors hire our employees who are under contract with us. We believe such proceedings are common in the financial services industry due to its highly competitive nature. An adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Regardless of the outcome of these claims, we generally incur significant costs and substantial management time in dealing with them.\nIf we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, or if we incur increased costs or restrictions associated with attracting and retaining personnel (such as lawsuits, arbitrations, sign-on or guaranteed bonuses or forgivable loans), our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition from brokerages, broker-dealers, financial services firms, and exchanges, many of which have greater market presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have, which could lead to pricing pressures that could adversely impact our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThe financial services industry is intensely competitive, and is expected to remain so. In our Financial Services segment, we primarily compete with three major, diversified inter-dealer brokers and financial intermediaries. These include NEX Group plc (\u201cNEX\u201d) (formerly known as ICAP plc),TP ICAP plc (\u201cTP ICAP\u201d) (formerly known as Tullett Prebon plc) and Compagnie Financiere Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel & Cie) (\u201cTradition\u201d), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. On January 12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100% of GFI\u2019s outstanding shares (see Item 1 \u201cAcquisition of GFI Group Inc.\u201d). Other inter-dealer broker and financial intermediary competitors include a number of smaller, privately-held firms that tend to specialize in specific products and services or geographic areas.\nWe also compete with companies that provide alternative products and services, such as contracts traded on futures exchanges, and trading processes, such as the direct dealer-to-dealer market for government securities and stock exchange markets for corporate equities, debt and other securities. We increasingly compete, directly or indirectly, with exchanges for the execution of trades in certain products, mainly in derivatives such as futures, swaps, options and options on futures. Certain exchanges have made and will likely continue to make attempts to move certain OTC-traded products to exchange-based execution, or to create listed derivatives products that mimic the qualities of similar OTC-traded products. We also compete with consortia, such as those operated by Tradeweb, which are created or funded from time to time by banks, broker-dealers and other companies involved in financial services, such as Thomson Reuters Corporation to compete in various markets with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. We may compete in OTC-traded products with platforms such as those owned by MarketAxess Holdings Inc., in fixed income products or various OTC FX platforms owned by exchanges such as BATS and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. In addition, financial data and information firms such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg L.P. operate trading platforms for both OTC and listed products, and may attempt to compete with us for trade execution in the future.\nSome of our competitors have greater market presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have and, as a result, our competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and expand their network infrastructures and product and service offerings more efficiently or more quickly than we can;\n\u2022\nadapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;\n\u2022\nidentify and consummate acquisitions and other opportunities more effectively than we can;\n\u2022\nhire our brokers and other key employees;\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services;\n\u2022\nmore effectively leverage existing relationships with customers and strategic partners or exploit more recognized brand names to market and sell their products and services;\n\u2022\nprovide a lower cost structure and lower commissions and fees;\n\u2022\nprovide access to trading in products or a range of products that at any particular time we do not offer; and\n\u2022\ndevelop services that are preferred by our customers.\nIn addition, new competitors may emerge, and our product and service lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of our existing product and service lines. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition for financial brokerage transactions also has resulted in substantial commission discounting by brokers that compete with us for business. Further discounting could adversely impact our revenues and margins and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations also include the sale of pricing and transactional data and information produced by our brokerage operations to securities information processors and/or vendors. There is a high degree of competition in pricing and transaction reporting products and services, and such businesses may become more competitive in the future. Competitors and customers of our financial brokerage businesses have together and individually offered market data and information products and services in competition with those offered and expected to be offered by us.\nInternational Operations Risks\nWe are generally subject to various risks inherent in doing business in the international financial markets, in addition to those unique to the regulated brokerage industry, and any failure to identify and manage those risks could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently provide products and services to customers in many foreign countries, and we may seek to further expand our operations into additional jurisdictions. On a consolidated basis, revenues from foreign countries were over $1.0 billion, or more than two-thirds of total revenues in our Financial Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2016. In many countries, the laws and rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local regulations in every jurisdiction. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and rules and regulations in a particular foreign jurisdiction could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nThere are also certain additional political, economic, legal, operational and other risks inherent in doing business in international financial markets, particularly in the regulated brokerage industry. These risks include:\n\u2022\nless developed automation in exchanges, depositories and national clearing systems;\n\u2022\nadditional or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, capital requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the laws, rules and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which we conduct business, including initiatives such as Brexit;\n\u2022\npossible nationalization, expropriation and regulatory, political and price controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ncapital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions;\n\u2022\nany failure to develop effective compliance and reporting systems, which could result in regulatory penalties in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nreduced protections for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nadverse labor and employment laws, including those related to compensation, tax, health insurance and benefits, and social security;\n\u2022\noutbreak of hostilities; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences arising from compliance with foreign laws, rules and regulations to which our international businesses are subject and the repatriation of overseas earnings.\nCredit Risk\nCredit rating downgrades or defaults by us, Cantor or another large financial institution could adversely affect us or financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. For example, we rely on Cantor as our clearing agent under the Clearing Agreement for certain securities transactions, primarily U.S. government securities, while we self-clear certain other products. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may need to provide our own liquidity.\nAs a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks related to U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also materially adversely affect us.\nThe credit ratings and associated outlooks of firms in our financial services industries, including us, may be critical to their reputation and operational and financial success. A firm\u2019s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the firm\u2019s competitive position in the industry and its relationship with other firms. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that firm or related firms warrant such a change. Any reduction in credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade.\nOur financial services activities are subject to credit and performance risks, which could result in us incurring significant losses that could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur activities are subject to credit and performance risks. For example, our customers may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value, there is a risk that we may have to expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that financing transactions are adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet commitments, we were to incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage credit risk, in both agency and principal transactions, through reporting and control procedures and by monitoring credit standards applicable to our customers and counterparties. These policies and procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading and similar incidents. Some of these risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, counterparties or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for these risks.\nTransactions executed on a matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty\u2019s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer\u2019s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the effect of magnifying the credit loss.\nWe are subject to financing risk because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or settlement losses of this nature could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeclines in the financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud and, therefore, may not have the financial resources to meet their obligations to us.\nIn agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. We are exposed to credit risk for commissions, as we bill customers for our agency brokerage services. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to disputes, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Any losses arising from such defaults could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn certain financial products, we act as a \u201cname passing\u201d broker, where the parties to the trade will settle directly against each other when their names are given up. In these markets, we may from time to time provide quotes. These quotes are intended to provide market values where we believe a customer can execute a transaction in a particular financial product. These quotes reflect our good faith view as to a reasonable bid/offer for that particular product. Prices may be received directly from a customer, or we may provide prices where we are confident the customers will be able to execute a trade, but do not have a customer currently supporting the price. In these cases the price will be based on our professional judgment. We may post or provide bids and offers in an effort (i) to present suitable markets where none would otherwise exist, or (ii) to exhibit spreads that are more reflective of contemporaneous market opinion or activity. In such cases, our efforts are intended to facilitate liquidity for our customers and to draw market participants to participate in a transaction. Although we will exercise strenuous efforts to execute at any given price, we cannot guarantee an execution at a certain price level.\nIn emerging market countries, we primarily conduct our financial services businesses on an agency and matched principal basis, where the risk of counterparty default, inconvertibility events and sovereign default is greater than in more developed countries.\nWe enter into transactions in cash and derivative instruments primarily on an agency and matched principal basis with counterparties domiciled in countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Transactions with these counterparties are generally in instruments or contracts of sovereign or corporate issuers located in the same country as the counterparty. This exposes us to a higher degree of sovereign or convertibility risk than in more developed countries.\nIn addition, these risks may entail correlated risks. A correlated risk arises when the counterparty\u2019s inability to meet its obligations also corresponds to a decline in the value of the instrument traded. In the case of a sovereign convertibility event or outright default, the counterparty to the trade may be unable to pay or transfer payment of an instrument purchased out of the country when the value of the instrument has declined due to the default or convertibility event.\nThe global financial crisis of recent years has heightened the risk of sovereign or convertibility events in emerging markets similar to the events that occurred in previous financial downturns. Our risk management function monitors the creditworthiness of emerging countries and counterparties on an ongoing basis and, when the risk of inconvertibility or sovereign default is deemed to be too great, correlated transactions or all transactions may be restricted or suspended. However, there can be no assurance that these procedures will be effective in controlling these risks.\nConcentration and Market Risk\nOur Financial Services segment has its rates business as its largest product category, and we could be significantly affected by any downturn in the rates product market.\nWe offer our financial services in five broad product categories: rates, credit, foreign exchange, energy and commodities and equity and other asset classes. Our financial services brokerage revenues are strongest in our rates products, which accounted for approximately 32.1% of our total financial services brokerage revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2016. While we focus on expanding and have successfully diversified our product offerings, we may currently be exposed to any adverse change or condition affecting the rates product market. Accordingly, the concentration of our businesses on rates products subjects our results to a greater market risk than if we had more diversified product offerings.\nDue to our current customer concentration, a loss of one or more of our significant customers could materially harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, our top ten Financial Services customers collectively, accounted for approximately 15.7% of our total revenues. We have limited long-term contracts with certain of these customers. If we were to lose one or more of these significant customers for any reason, including as a result of further consolidation and concentration in the financial services industry, and not be compensated for such loss by doing additional business with other customers or by adding new customers, our revenues would decline significantly and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would materially suffer.\nOur financial services revenues and profitability could be reduced or otherwise materially adversely affected by pricing plans relating to commissions and fees on our trading platform.\nWe negotiate from time to time with certain customers (including many of our largest customers) to enter into customized volume discount pricing plans. While the pricing plans are designed to encourage customers to be more active on our electronic trading platform, they reduce the amount of commissions and fees payable to us by certain of our most active customers for certain products, which could reduce our revenues and constrain our profitability. From time to time, these pricing plans come up for renewal. Failure of a number of our larger customers to enter into renewed agreements, or agreements on terms as favorable as existing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on volumes on our electronic trading platform, the commissions payable to us, our revenues and our profitability.\nReduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and/or specialists could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nComputer-generated buy/sell programs and other technological advances and regulatory changes in the marketplace may continue to tighten securities spreads. In addition, new and enhanced alternative trading systems, such as electronic communications networks, have emerged as alternatives for individual and institutional investors, as well as broker-dealers. As such systems do not direct trades through market makers, their use could result in reduced revenues for us or for our customers. In addition, reduced trading levels could lead to lower revenues which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have market risk exposure from unmatched principal transactions entered into by some of our desks, as well as holdings of marketable equity securities, which could result in losses and have a material effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects for any particular reporting period. In addition, financial fraud or unauthorized trading activity could also materially impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOn a limited basis, our desks enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business to facilitate transactions, add liquidity, improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue opportunities and attract additional order flow or in certain instances as the result of an error and, in a limited number of instances and subject to risk management limits, for the purpose of proprietary trading. As a result, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched principal transactions.\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients\u2019 execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of the overall position, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered and the amount of time the position is held before we dispose of the position. Although we have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market.\nCertain categories of trades settle for clearing purposes with CF&Co, one of our affiliates. CF&Co is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. We, CF&Co and other affiliates act in a matched principal or principal capacity in markets by posting and/or acting upon quotes for our account. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us, CF&Co and our affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those established as a result of combination trades and errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and attracting order flow. Similarly, when framing a market in a \u201cname passing \u201d marketplace, BGC and its affiliates may post quotations that we believe reflect contemporaneous and/or anticipated potential market interest in an effort to facilitate liquidity for market participants on our respective platforms. The firms use commercially reasonable efforts to find a counterparty for any resulting transactions, at the customary minimum size level for that market.\nFrom a risk management perspective, we monitor risk on an end-of-day basis, and desk managers generally monitor such exposure on a continuous basis. Any unmatched positions are intended to be disposed of in the short term. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the markets on which we trade, we may not be able to match the position or effectively hedge its exposure and often may be forced to hold a position overnight that has not been hedged. To the extent these\nunmatched positions are not disposed of intra-day, we mark these positions to market. Adverse movements in the securities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a loss. In the event of any unauthorized trading activity or financial fraud that is not detected by management, it is possible that these unmatched positions could be outstanding for a long period. At the time of any sales and settlements of these positions, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair values. In addition, our estimates or determinations of the values of our various positions, assets or businesses are subject to the accuracy of our assumptions and the valuation models or multiples used. Any principal losses and gains resulting from these positions could on occasion have disproportionate effects, negative or positive, on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for any particular reporting period.\nIn addition, in recent years we have had considerable holdings of marketable securities received by us as consideration for the sale of certain businesses. These holdings include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ, Inc. that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury platform, and the shares of common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. We may seek to manage the market risk exposure inherent in such holdings by minimizing the effect of price changes on a portion of such holdings through the use of derivative contracts. There can, however, be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with these holdings, or that the costs of such hedging activities will not be significant. Further, any such hedging activities and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including unpredicted price movements, counterparty defaults or other risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have equity investments or profit sharing interests in entities whose primary business is proprietary trading. These investments could expose us to losses that could adversely affect our net income and the value of our assets.\nWe have equity investments or profit sharing interests in entities whose primary business is proprietary trading. The accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage ownership or profit share and whether we have any influence or control over the relevant entity. Under certain accounting standards, any losses experienced by these entities on their investment activities could adversely impact our net income and the value of our assets. In addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we could lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits from trading.\nWe may not be able to realize the full value of the NASDAQ Transaction or other stock transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOn June 28, 2013, we sold our on-the-run, electronic benchmark U.S. Treasury platform to NASDAQ. The total consideration consisted of $750 million in cash, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock to be paid ratably over 15 years, provided that NASDAQ, as a whole, produces at least $25 million in gross revenues each year. Of the 14,883,705 shares, as of February 24, 2017, 3,968,988 shares have been received and up to 10,914,717 shares remain to be received. This earn-out presents market risk as the value of consideration related to the NASDAQ shares is subject to fluctuations based on the NASDAQ common stock share price. Therefore, if NASDAQ were to experience financial difficulties or a significant downturn, we may be unable to realize the full value of the NASDAQ Transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, and could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOn December 11, 2015, we sold our Trayport business for 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock (the \u201cICE Shares\u201d). All of such ICE shares were received at closing and have been registered for resale on our behalf. As of February 24, 2017, over 95% of such shares have been sold.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will be successful in employing any consideration that we have and will receive, including the earn-out from the NASDAQ Transaction or the proceeds from the sale of NASDAQ and ICE shares, in such a way as to provide a net benefit to us compared to the revenues, profit margins, and cash flows represented by the assets that we sold in the NASDAQ and Trayport transactions. While we intend to use that consideration in ways that will be beneficial to us and our businesses, including in continuing to seek to grow the portion of the electronic platform that we retained and to make acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, or that our failure to do so will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may also face credit, market and other risks in connection with the temporary or longer-term investment of our available cash, including that received from the NASDAQ Transaction or from our sale of NASDAQ and ICE shares, pending our use of the proceeds in our businesses or to make acquisitions, such as the risk of defaults or impairments of our investments.\nAs a result of our acquisition of GFI, we became subject to various operational, financial, control and compliance risks of GFI and any expected revenue opportunities, cost savings, and other benefits and synergies expected to occur as a result of the acquisition may not occur in the currently contemplated timeframe, or at all.\nAs a result of our acquisition of GFI, we became exposed to various operational, financial, control and compliance risks of GFI that are not publicly disclosed. As a result, we are exposed to unknown risks and liabilities in connection with GFI and its acquisition. In addition, future earnings of our combined businesses could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of competition from other marketplace participants; economic conditions, including changes in trading volumes, inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, or the availability of capital; our ability to comply with all covenants in our credit facilities; and the risks and uncertainties with respect to our businesses as described in our reports and documents filed with the SEC. Further, the anticipated revenue opportunities, cost savings, and other benefits and synergies from the acquisition of GFI may not be fully realized, if at all, or may take longer to realize than currently contemplated. Any such factors or others could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similar factors could have an impact on our businesses in connection with other acquisitions from time to time, including to the extent that we complete acquisitions in new business lines or verticals.\nOther General Financial Services Segment Risks\nOur Financial Services operations are global and exchange rate fluctuations and international market events could materially adversely impact our financial results.\nBecause our Financial Services operations are global, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues and expenses, in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor our net exposure in foreign currencies and markets on a daily basis and hedge our exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. However, potential movements in the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we earn revenues could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nFurthermore, our revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from social or political instability, changes in government policies or policies of central banks, downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments in such non-U.S. jurisdictions. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations on our results could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.\nEmployee misconduct, fraud, miscommunication or error could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain customers and subjecting us to significant financial losses, legal liability, regulatory sanctions and penalties and reputational harm; moreover, misconduct is difficult to detect and deter, and error is difficult to prevent.\nEmployee misconduct, fraud or error could subject us to financial losses, legal liability, and regulatory sanctions and penalties and could seriously harm our reputation and negatively affect us. Misconduct or fraud by employees could include engaging in improper or unauthorized transactions or activities, failing to properly supervise other employees or improperly using confidential information.\nEmployee errors and miscommunication, including mistakes in executing, recording or processing transactions for customers, could cause us to enter into transactions that customers may disavow and refuse to settle, which could expose us to the risk of material losses even if the errors and miscommunication are detected and the transactions are unwound or reversed. If our customers are not able to settle their transactions on a timely basis, the time in which employee errors and miscommunication are detected may be increased and our risk of material loss could be increased. The risk of employee error and miscommunication may be greater for products or services that are new or have non-standardized terms.\nIt is not always possible to deter and detect employee misconduct or fraud or prevent errors and miscommunications. While we have various supervisory systems and compliance processes and procedures in place, and seek to mitigate applicable risks, the precautions we take to deter and detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nAlthough portions of our compensation structure are variable, significant parts of our cost structure are fixed, and if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs in the amount that our revenues decline, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough portions of our compensation structure are variable, significant parts of our cost structure are fixed. We base our overall cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for these products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. If we are unable to reduce our costs in the amount that our revenues decline, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE SERVICES BUSINESS\nGeneral and Real Estate Services Market Conditions\nNegative general economic conditions and commercial real estate market conditions can have a material adverse effect on our NGKF commercial real estate services businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCommercial real estate markets are cyclical. They relate to the condition of the economy or, at least, to the perceptions of investors and users as to the relevant economic outlook. For example, companies may be hesitant to expand their office space or enter into long-term real estate commitments if they are concerned about the general economic environment. Companies that are under financial pressure for any reason, or are attempting to more aggressively manage their expenses, may reduce the size of their workforces, limit capital expenditures, including with respect to their office space, permit more of their staff to work from home and/or seek corresponding reductions in office space and related management or other services.\nNegative general economic conditions and declines in the demand for commercial real estate brokerage and related management services in several markets or in significant markets could also have a material adverse effect on our commercial real estate services businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nA general decline in acquisition and disposition activity can lead to a reduction in the commissions and fees we receive for arranging such transactions, as well as in commissions and fees we earn for arranging the financing for acquirers.\n\u2022\nA general decline in the value and performance of commercial real estate and in rental rates can lead to a reduction in management and leasing commissions and fees. Additionally, such declines can lead to a reduction in commissions and fees that are based on the value of, or revenue produced by, the properties for which we provide services. This may include commissions and fees for appraisal and valuation, sales and leasing, and property and facilities management.\n\u2022\nCyclicality in the commercial real estate markets may lead to volatility in our earnings, and the commercial real estate business can be highly sensitive to market perception of the economy generally and our industry specifically. Real estate markets are also thought to \u201clag\u201d the broader economy. This means that, even when underlying economic fundamentals improve in a given market, it may take additional time for these improvements to translate into strength in the real estate markets.\n\u2022\nPeriods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, political uncertainty, changes in government administrations or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our NGKF business lines.\nWhile the U.S. commercial property market continues to display strength despite slowing growth of commercial property prices, according to CoStar Realty Information, Inc. (\u201cCoStar\u201d), there can be no assurances that such strength will continue. Although Deutsche Bank Markets Research estimates that the spreads between commercial property capitalization rates for all property types and both 10-year U.S. Treasuries and BBB-rated U.S. corporate bonds remain around their 20-year average postelection, following the U.S. elections in 2016, interest rates rose across the U.S. benchmark yield curve, due in part to expectations of increased economic growth due to potential fiscal stimulus. We would expect this to fuel continued demand for commercial real estate for as long as the U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace although no assurance can be given as to this.\nBusiness Concentration Risks\nThe concentration of our real estate business with corporate clients can increase business risk, and our business can be adversely affected due to the loss of certain of these clients.\nWe value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients because of the increased efficiency and economics that can result from developing repeat business from the same client and from performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client. Although our client portfolio is currently highly diversified-for the year ended December 31, 2016, our top ten Real Estate servicesclients, collectively, accounted for less than 3% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis-as we grow our business, relationships with certain corporate clients may increase, and our client portfolio may become increasingly concentrated. For example, part of our strategy is to increase our GCS revenues which may lead to greater concentration of revenues with corporate clients. Part of our strategy is to increase our global corporate services revenue which may lead to greater concentration of revenue with corporate clients in the future. Having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can lead to greater or more concentrated risks of loss if, among other possibilities, any such client (1) experiences its own financial problems; (2) becomes bankrupt or insolvent, which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have previously provided or funds we have previously advanced; (3) decides to reduce its operations or its real estate facilities; (4) makes a change in its real estate strategy, such as no longer outsourcing its real estate operations; (5) decides to change its providers of real estate services; or (6) merges with another corporation or otherwise undergoes a change of control, which may result in new management taking over with a different real estate philosophy or in different relationships with other real estate providers.\nAdditionally, competitive conditions, particularly in connection with increasingly large clients, may require us to compromise on certain contract terms with respect to the extent of risk transfer, acting as principal rather than agent in connection with supplier relationships, liability limitations and other contractual terms. Where competitive pressures result in higher levels of potential liability under our contracts, the cost of operational errors and other activities for which we have indemnified our clients will be greater and may not be fully insured.\nWhere we provide real estate services to firms in the financial services industry, including banks and investment banks, our real estate segment is experiencing indirectly the increasing extent of the regulatory environment to which they are subject in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This increases the cost of doing business with them, which we are not always able to pass on, as the result of the additional resources and processes we are required to provide as a critical supplier.\nRegulatory/Legal\nWe may have liabilities in connection with our commercial real estate businesses, including appraisal and valuation, sales and leasing and property and facilities management activities.\nAs a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial real estate services, we and our licensed sales professionals and independent contractors that work for us are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed.\nWe could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations. We could also become subject to claims made by clients for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our appraisals and/or valuations. We also could be subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities if they determine that we are violating licensing laws by failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nIn our property and facilities management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our clients may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the client relationship. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nBecause we employ large numbers of building staff in facilities that we manage, we face risk in potential claims relating to employment injuries, termination and other employment matters. While these risks are generally passed back to the building owner, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nIn connection with a limited number of our facilities management agreements, we have guaranteed that the client will achieve certain savings objectives. In the event that these objectives are not met, we are obligated to pay the shortfall amount to the client. In most instances, the obligation to pay such amount is limited to the amount of fees (or the amount of a subset of the fees) earned by us under the contract, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to mitigate against these payments or that the payments, particularly if aggregated with those required under other agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our ongoing arrangements with particular clients or our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The percentage of our Real Estate Services revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 subject to such obligations under our current facilities management agreements is less than 1%. While these liabilities have been immaterial to date, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nAdverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our commercial real estate services business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage maintained by us. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by any commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company\u2019s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. In addition, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, we may not be covered by insurance. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our commercial real estate business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nIf we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to commercial real estate brokerage, valuation and appraisal and mortgage transactions and other real estate business lines, then we may incur significant financial penalties.\nDue to the broad geographic scope of our operations and the commercial real estate services we perform, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations specific to our services. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and other related activities require us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we conduct activities for which a real estate license is required. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license or violate any of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our licenses, then we may be subject to audits, required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or be prevented from collecting commissions owed, be compelled to return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.\nIn addition, because the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing and regulatory regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. Furthermore, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business lines also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance. The failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations could result in significant financial penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our commercial real estate businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEnvironmental regulations may adversely impact our commercial real estate businesses and/or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations which impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to some properties. A decrease or delay in such transactions may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns in connection with a real estate transaction may subject us to liability to a buyer/seller or lessee/lessor of property. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability in connection with these types of environmental issues, there is no assurance that this will not occur.\nIn addition, in our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard to the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these laws may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. Insurance for such matters may not be available or sufficient. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability under these laws, this may not always be the case.\nCertain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of legal compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims. More stringent enforcement of existing regulations could cause us to incur significant costs in the future, and/or materially adversely impact our commercial real estate brokerage and management services businesses.\nReal Estate Services Competition\nWe operate in a highly competitive commercial real estate services industry with numerous competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.\nWe compete to provide a variety of services within the commercial real estate industry. Each of these business disciplines is highly competitive on a local, regional, national and global level. We face competition not only from other national real estate service companies, but also from global real estate services companies, boutique real estate advisory firms, and consulting and appraisal firms. Depending on the product or service, we also face competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting firms, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms that are substantially smaller than we are, some of our competitors are substantially larger than us on a local, regional, national or international basis and have similar service competencies to ours. Such competitors include CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers International. In addition, specialized firms like HFF, Inc., Marcus & Millichap Inc. and Eastdil Secured, LLC compete with us in certain of our service lines. Our industry has continued to consolidate, and there is an inherent risk that competitive firms may be more successful than we are at growing through merger and acquisition activity. In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with respect to any of our commercial real estate business lines or on an overall basis, to maintain current commission and fee levels or margins, or to maintain or increase our market share.\nOther General Real Estate Services Risks\nIf we experience difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or experience defaults by multiple clients, it could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face challenges in our ability to efficiently and/or effectively collect accounts receivable.\nAny of our clients or other parties obligated to make payments to us may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition. As a result, a client or other party obligated to make payments to us may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. A bankruptcy of a client or other party obligated to make payments to us would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us. In addition, certain corporate services and property and facilities management agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client or other party obligated to make payments to us were to file for bankruptcy, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur. Any such failure to make payments when due or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a large number of our clients (e.g. during an economic downturn) could result in disruption to our Real Estate Services businesses and material losses to us. Part of our strategy is to increase our global corporate services revenue, which may lead to greater concentration of revenues with corporate clients in the future. While historically we have not incurred material losses as a result of the difficulties described above, this may not always be the case.\nWe may not be able to replace partner offices when affiliation agreements are terminated, which may decrease our scope of services and geographic reach.\nWe have agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain independently owned offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of Newmark in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of a Company-owned office to replace an independent office requires us to invest capital, which in some cases could be material. There can be no assurance that, if we lose additional independently owned offices, we will be able to identify suitable replacement affiliates or fund the establishment or acquisition of an owned office. In addition, although we do not control the activities of these independently owned offices, we may face reputational risk if any of these independently owned offices are involved in or accused of illegal, unethical or similar behavior. Failure to maintain coverage in important geographic markets may negatively impact our operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain key employees and expand domestically and internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE\nCorporate Structure\nBecause our voting control is concentrated among the holders of our Class B common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock may be materially adversely affected by its disparate voting rights.\nAs of February 24, 2017, Cantor (including CFGM) beneficially owned all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 58.5% of our total voting power. In addition, Cantor has the right to exchange exchangeable partnership interests in BGC Holdings into additional shares of Class B common stock, and pursuant to an exchange agreement with us, Cantor has the right to exchange shares of our Class A common stock for additional shares of Class B common stock, in the aggregate up to the then-remaining number of our authorized but unissued Class B shares.\nAs long as Cantor beneficially owns a majority of our total voting power, it will have the ability, without the consent of the public holders of our Class A common stock, to elect all of the members of our board of directors and to control our management and affairs. In addition, it will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us. In certain circumstances, such as when transferred to an entity controlled by Cantor or Mr. Lutnick, the shares of Class B common stock issued to Cantor may be transferred without conversion to Class A common stock.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders in general. The Class B common stock is controlled by Cantor and is not subject to conversion or termination by our board of directors or any committee thereof, or any other stockholder or third party. This differential in the voting rights of Class B common stock could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a different effect on holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nStockholders may not be able to challenge decisions that have an adverse effect upon holders of our Class A common stock compared to holders of our Class B common stock if our board of directors acts in a disinterested, informed manner with respect to these decisions, in good faith and in the belief that it is acting in the best interests of our stockholders. Delaware law generally provides that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders, regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties to different groups of stockholders, subject to applicable provisions set forth in a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and general principles of corporate law and fiduciary duties.\nDelaware law, our corporate organizational documents and other requirements may impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our Class A stockholders. Some provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws could make the following more difficult:\n\u2022\nacquisition of us by means of a tender offer;\n\u2022\nacquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nremoval of our incumbent officers and directors.\nThese provisions, summarized below, may discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions may also encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to negotiate with the initiator of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of them could result in an improvement of their terms.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our board of directors, or in the event the Chairman of our board of directors is unavailable, by the Chief Executive Officer or by the holders of a majority of the voting power of our Class B common stock, which is held by Cantor and CFGM. In addition, our certificate of incorporation permits us to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws require advance written notice prior to a meeting of our stockholders of a proposal or director nomination which a stockholder desires to present at such a meeting, which generally must be received by our Secretary not later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement for the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting. In the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of such proxy statement or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. Our bylaws provide that all amendments to our bylaws must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote or by a majority of our board of directors.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or the transaction in which the person became an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, or was the owner of 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock at any time within the prior three years, other than \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d prior to the time our Class A common stock was traded on NASDAQ. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of Class A common stock.\nIn addition, our brokerage businesses are heavily regulated and some of our regulators require that they approve transactions which could result in a change of control, as defined by the then-applicable rules of our regulators. The requirement that this approval be obtained may prevent or delay transactions that would result in a change of control.\nFurther, our Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan contains provisions pursuant to which grants that are unexercisable or unvested may automatically become exercisable or vested as of the date immediately prior to certain change of control events. Additionally, change in control and employment agreements between us and our named executive officers also provide for certain grants, payments, and grants of exchangeability in the event of certain change of control events.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by Cantor, including shares of our Class B common stock, and rights to acquire additional such shares, and the provisions of the indentures for our outstanding notes discussed above, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of the Class A common stock.\nWe are a parent holding company, and accordingly we are dependent upon distributions from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to pay dividends, taxes and indebtedness and other expenses and to make repurchases.\nWe are a parent holding company with no direct operations and will be able to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses, and to make repurchases of shares our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions or loans from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. As discussed above, regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In addition, any unanticipated accounting, tax or other charges against net income could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and to make repurchases.\nBGC U.S. and BGC Global intend to distribute to their limited partners, including us, on a pro rata and quarterly basis, cash that is not required to meet BGC U.S.\u2019s and BGC Global\u2019s anticipated business and regulatory needs. As a result, BGC U.S.\u2019s and BGC Global\u2019s ability, and in turn our ability, to make such distributions will depend upon the continuing profitability and strategic and operating needs of our businesses, including various capital adequacy and clearing capital requirements promulgated by federal, self-regulatory, and other authorities to which our subsidiaries are subject. We expect to pay not less than 75% of our post-tax distributable earnings per fully diluted share as cash dividends to our common stockholders, with the balance of such distributable earnings to be available to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others.\nOur board of directors and our Audit Committee have authorized repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries as part of this policy, including those held by Cantor and/or its partners, our executive officers, other employees and partners. In February 2017, this authorization was increased back to $300 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had approximately $298.8 million remaining under this $300 million authorization and may continue to actively make such repurchases or purchases, or cease to make such repurchases or purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive in BGC U.S.\u2019s and BGC Global\u2019s respective businesses, although we neither have current plans to do so nor do we expect to do so as long as we maintain our current dividend policy. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid or that dividend amounts will be maintained at current or future levels.\nIf our dividend policy is materially different than the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, upon the exchange of any BGC Holdings limited partnership interests such BGC Holdings limited partners could receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us.\nTo the extent BGC Holdings distributes to its limited partners a greater share of income received from BGC U.S. and BGC Global than we distribute to our stockholders, then as founding/working partners, limited partnership unit holders and/or Cantor exercise any exchange right to acquire our Class A common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable, exchanging partners may receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. The reason is that the exchanging partner could receive both (1) the benefit of the distribution that has not been distributed by us from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to BGC Holdings (in the form of a distribution by BGC Holdings to its limited partners) and (2) the benefit of the distribution from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to us (in the form of a subsequent cash dividend paid by us, a greater percentage indirect interest in BGC U.S. and BGC Global following a repurchase of Class A common stock by us or a greater value of assets following a purchase of assets by us with the cash that otherwise would be distributed to our stockholders). Consequently, if our dividend policy does not match the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, other holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of the date of an exchange could experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. Our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are different from the distributions made by BGC Holdings to its unit holders.\nIf Cantor, we or any of our subsidiaries were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf Cantor ceases to hold a majority of our voting power, Cantor\u2019s interest in us could be deemed an investment security under the Investment Company Act. If we were to cease participation in the management of BGC Holdings (or if BGC Holdings, in turn, were to cease participation in the management of BGC U.S. and BGC Global) or be deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of BGC Holdings (or if BGC Holdings, in turn, were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of BGC U.S. and BGC Global), our interests in BGC Holdings or BGC U.S. and BGC Global could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act. If BGC Holdings ceased to participate in the management of BGC U.S. and BGC Global or were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of BGC U.S. or BGC Global, its interest in BGC U.S. or BGC Global could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act.\nGenerally, an entity is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items), absent an applicable exemption. A determination that we hold more than 40% of our assets in investment securities could result in us being an investment company under the Investment Company Act and becoming subject to registration and other requirements of the Investment Company Act. We expect to take all legally permissible action to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, but no assurance can be given that this event will not occur.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed prescriptions for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, limit the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options and impose certain governance requirements. If anything were to happen that would cause Cantor, us, or BGC Holdings to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Company Act would limit our or its capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including Cantor, BGC Holdings, or BGC U.S. and BGC Global, as the case may be) and ability to compensate key employees. Therefore, if Cantor, we, or BGC Holdings became subject to the Investment Company Act, it could make it impractical to continue our businesses, impair agreements and arrangements, and impair the transactions contemplated by those agreements and arrangements, between and among Cantor, us, BGC Holdings, and BGC U.S., and BGC Global, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPartnership Structure\nOur BGC Holdings partnership structure may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain, compensate and motivate some employee partners.\nWhile we believe that our BGC Holdings partnership structure promotes recruitment and retention and motivation of our employee partners, some employee partners may be more attracted to the benefits of working at a privately controlled partnership, or at a public company with a different compensation structure than our own, which may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain, compensate and motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests, as described below), any such founding/working or other limited partners are, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and us, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine, only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner\u2019s capital account or post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units have no right to a post-termination payment, receive a preferred but fixed distribution amount, and/or cannot be made exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock. Moreover, unless and until units are made exchangeable, limited partners have no unilateral right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of Class A common stock.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership interests are also subject to redemption, and subject founding/working and other limited partners to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as well as other obligations. In addition, the exercise of Cantor\u2019s right to purchase from BGC Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests generally when founding partner units are redeemed or granted exchangeability will result in the share of distributions of income from the operations of our businesses on other outstanding BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or granted exchangeability without such Cantor right to purchase. In addition, any purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units by Cantor from BGC Holdings following Cantor\u2019s decision to grant exchangeability on founding partner units will result in additional dilution to the other partners of BGC Holdings.\nThe terms of the BGC Holdings limited partnership interests held by founding/working and limited partners also provide for the following:\n\u2022\nsuch units are not entitled to reinvest the distributions on their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests in additional BGC Holdings limited partnership interests at preferential or historical prices or at all; and\n\u2022\nCantor is entitled to receive any amounts from selected extraordinary transactions that are withheld from distributions to certain partners and forfeited by partners leaving BGC Holdings prior to their interests in such withheld distributions fully vesting, rather than any such forfeited amounts accruing to the benefit of all BGC Holdings limited partners on a pro rata basis.\nIn addition, the ability to acquire shares of our Class A common stock underlying BGC Holdings exchangeable units is not dependent upon the partner\u2019s continued employment with us or compliance with partner obligations, and such partners are therefore not restricted from leaving us by the potential loss of such shares.\nWe may be required to pay Cantor for a significant portion of the tax benefit relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we claim as a result of any step up in the tax basis of the assets of BGC U.S. and BGC Global resulting from Cantor\u2019s exchange of interests in BGC Holdings for our common stock.\nCantor\u2019s partnership interests in BGC Holdings may be exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock, on a one for one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The exchanges may result in increases to our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of each of BGC U.S. and BGC Global that otherwise would not have been available, although the Internal Revenue Service may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge by the Internal Revenue Service. These increases in tax basis, if sustained, may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nWe are a party to rights and obligations under a tax receivable agreement with Cantor that provides for the payment by us to Cantor of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. It is expected that we will benefit from the remaining 15% cash savings, if any, in income tax that we realize. Cantor has not exercised this right to date, but there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Cantor and Its Affiliates\nWe are controlled by Cantor, which has potential conflicts of interest with us and may exercise its control in a way that favors its interests to our detriment.\nCantor effectively is able to exercise control over our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and determinations with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, as well as material expansions or contractions of our businesses, entry into new lines of businesses and borrowings and issuances of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock or other securities. This control is subject to the approval of our Audit Committee on those matters requiring such approval. Cantor\u2019s voting power may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and Cantor in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\npotential acquisitions and dispositions of businesses;\n\u2022\nthe issuance or disposition of securities by us;\n\u2022\nthe election of new or additional directors to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends by us (if any), distribution of profits by BGC U.S., BGC Global and/or BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock or purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others;\n\u2022\nbusiness operations or business opportunities of ours and Cantor\u2019s that would compete with the other party\u2019s business opportunities, including Cantor\u2019s and our brokerage and financial services;\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving us;\n\u2022\nconflicts between our agency trading for primary and secondary bond sales and Cantor\u2019s investment banking bond origination business;\n\u2022\ncompetition between our and Cantor\u2019s other equity derivatives and cash equity inter-dealer brokerage businesses;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of administrative services to be provided to or by Cantor and/or Tower Bridge; and\n\u2022\nprovision of clearing capital pursuant to the Clearing Agreement and potential and existing loan arrangements.\nWe also expect Cantor to manage its ownership of us so that it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, including by maintaining its voting power in us above a majority absent an applicable exemption from the Investment Company Act. This may result in conflicts with us, including those relating to acquisitions or offerings by us involving issuances of shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock, that would dilute Cantor\u2019s voting power in us.\nIn addition, Cantor has from time to time in the past and may in the future consider possible strategic realignments of its own businesses and/or of the relationships that exist between and among Cantor and its other affiliates and us. Any future related-party transaction or arrangement between Cantor and its other affiliates and us is subject to the prior approval by our Audit Committee, but\ngenerally does not otherwise require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval is required, Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of the other stockholders. Further, our regulators, including the FCA, may require the consolidation, for regulatory purposes, of Cantor and its other affiliates and us with respect to our U.K.-regulated entities or other entities or require other restructuring of the group. There is no assurance that such consolidation or restructuring would not result in a material expense or disruption to our businesses.\nMoreover, the service of officers or partners of Cantor as our executive officers and directors, and those persons\u2019 ownership interests in and payments from Cantor and its affiliates, could create conflicts of interest when we and those directors or executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Cantor. Our ability to retain our key employees and the ability of certain key employees to devote adequate time to us are critical to the success of our businesses, and failure to do so may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur agreements and other arrangements with Cantor may be amended upon agreement of the parties to those agreements upon approval of our Audit Committee. During the time that we are controlled by Cantor, Cantor may be able to require us to agree to amendments to these agreements. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nIn order to address potential conflicts of interest between Cantor and its representatives and us, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs as they may involve Cantor and its representatives, and our powers, rights, duties and liabilities and those of our representatives in connection with our relationship with Cantor and its affiliates, officers, directors, general partners or employees. Our certificate of incorporation provides that no Cantor Company, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, or any of the representatives, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, of a Cantor Company will owe any fiduciary duty to, nor will any Cantor Company or any of their respective representatives be liable for breach of fiduciary duty to, us or any of our stockholders, including with respect to corporate opportunities. In addition, Cantor and its respective representatives have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers. The corporate opportunity policy that is included in our certificate of incorporation is designed to resolve potential conflicts of interest between us and Cantor and its representatives.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement contains similar provisions with respect to us and/or Cantor and each of our respective representatives, and the BGC U.S. and BGC Global limited partnership agreements contain similar provisions with respect to us and/or BGC Holdings and each of our respective representatives.\nIf Cantor competes with us, it could materially harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAgreements between us and Cantor are between related parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could have negotiated with third parties and may subject us to litigation.\nOur relationship with Cantor results in agreements with Cantor that are between related parties. As a result, the prices charged to us or by us for services provided under agreements with Cantor may be higher or lower than prices that may be charged by third parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could have negotiated with third parties. For example, pursuant to the separation agreement relating to our acquisition of certain of our BGC businesses from Cantor in 2008, Cantor has a right, subject to certain conditions, to be our customer and to pay the lowest commissions paid by any other customer, whether by volume, dollar or other applicable measure. In addition, Cantor has an unlimited right to internally use market data from us without any cost. Any future related-party transactions or arrangements between us and Cantor are subject to the prior approval by our Audit Committee, but generally do not otherwise require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval were required, Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of the other stockholders.\nThese related-party relationships may from time to time subject us to litigation. For example, a purported derivative action, since dismissed, was filed alleging that certain related-party transactions were unfair to us.\nWe are controlled by Cantor, which in turn controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which is acting as our sales agent in our controlled equity offerings and provides us with additional investment banking services. In addition, other affiliates of Cantor may provide us with advice and services from time to time.\nWe are controlled by Cantor, which in turn controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which acts as our sales agent pursuant to a controlled equity offering sales agreement, which was entered into on November 20, 2014 (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of 20 million shares of our Class A common stock. Under the Sales Agreement, we agree to pay CF&Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn selling shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement, we may determine to instruct CF&Co not to sell our shares at less than a minimum price per share designated by us. Alternatively, we may instruct CF&Co to sell our shares so as to seek to realize a designated minimum price per share for all shares sold over a designated time period, or so as to seek to raise a designated minimum dollar amount of gross proceeds from sales of all such shares over a designated time period.\nCF&Co has retained independent legal advisors in connection with its role as sales agent under the Sales Agreement, but for the reasons described below it may not be in a position to provide us with independent financial input in connection with the offering of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We are not required to, and have not engaged, an independent investment banking firm to act as a qualified independent underwriter or to otherwise provide us with independent input in our controlled equity offerings.\nWhile our board of directors and Audit Committee will be involved with any future decision by us to enter into or terminate new sales agreements with CF&Co, our management has been delegated the authority to determine, and to so instruct CF&Co with respect to, matters involving the manner, timing, number of shares, and minimum prices per share or proceeds for sales of our shares, or the suspension thereof, in our controlled equity offering pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Our management may be expected to consult with appropriate personnel from CF&Co in making such determinations, but given the overlap between our senior management and that of Cantor and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CF&Co, it may be expected that any joint determinations by our senior management and that of CF&Co with respect to our controlled equity offering will involve the same individuals. In making such joint determinations, our Audit Committee has instructed our senior management to act in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Nevertheless, in making such determinations, such individuals will not have the benefit of input from an independent investment banking firm that is able to make its own determinations with respect to our controlled equity offering, including, but not limited to, whether to suspend sales under the Sales Agreement or to terminate the Sales Agreement.\nIn addition, Cantor, CF&Co and their affiliates have provided investment banking services to us and our affiliates in the past, and may be expected to do so in the future, including acting as our financial advisor in connection with business combinations, dispositions, or other transactions, including the acquisition of GFI, and placing or recommending to us various investments, stock loans or cash management vehicles. They receive customary fees and commissions for these services. They may also receive brokerage and market data and analytics products and services from us and our respective affiliates. From time to time, CF&Co may make a market in our notes. We also provide to and receive from Cantor and its affiliates various administrative services.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nPurchasers, as well as existing stockholders, may experience significant dilution as a result of offerings of shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe Sales Agreement with CF&Co currently remains in effect to assist us with partner and employee sales of shares of Class A common stock. It provides for the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 20 million shares of our Class A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. As of February 24, 2017, we have issued and sold an aggregate of approximately 16.2 million shares of Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement, with approximately 3.8 million shares of Class A common stock remaining to be sold under the Agreement. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to the issuance of up to an aggregate of 20 million additional shares of our Class A common stock for which we have not yet entered into a sales agreement. Further, we have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the offer and sale of up to an aggregate of 20 million shares of Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of February 24, 2017, we have issued an aggregate of 9.7 million shares of Class A common stock under the Form S-4, all in connection with acquisitions. In addition, in connection with the conversion of our 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes due April 15, 2015, on April 13, 2015 we issued to Cantor in a private placement 24,042,599 shares of our Class A common stock, and in connection with the JPI Back-End Merger to complete our acquisition of GFI, on January 12, 2016 we issued to the JPI stockholders in a private placement 23,481,192 shares of Class A common stock; in both cases, we filed effective shelf registration statements on Form S-3, registering such shares of Class A common stock for resale. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to an aggregate of 10 million shares of our Class A common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. As of February 24, 2017, we have issued approximately 283,000 shares of our Class A common stock under such Plan. We have filed a number of registration statements on Form S-8 pursuant to which we have registered the shares underlying our Long Term Incentive Plan. As of January 31, 2017, there were 208.9 million shares remaining for sale under such registration statements.\nBecause the sales of shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreements have been made, and any other future sales of our Class A common stock may be made, in privately negotiated transactions or directly into the market at prevailing market prices or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, the prices at which these shares have been sold and may be sold in the future will vary, and these variations may be significant. Purchasers of these shares may suffer significant dilution if the price they pay is higher than the price paid by other purchasers of shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement and any future offerings of our shares of Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the sale by us of any shares of our Class A common stock may have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing Class A common stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nour existing Class A common stockholders may suffer significant dilution;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available per share for dividends payable on shares of our Class A common stock may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of our Class A common stock may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nBecause we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement, and may use the net proceeds from future offerings, for general corporate purposes, which, among other things, are expected to include repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings units or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and/or to replenish cash used to effect such repurchases and purchases, investors should be aware that such net proceeds will not be available for other corporate purposes, and that, depending upon the timing and prices of such repurchases of shares and purchases of units and of the sales of our shares under the Sales Agreement and the liquidity and depth of our market, we may sell a greater aggregate number of shares, at a lower average price per share, under the Sales Agreement than the number of shares or units repurchased or purchased, thereby increasing the aggregate number of shares and units outstanding and decreasing our earnings per share.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds of the sale of shares of Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement, and may use the net proceeds from future offerings, for general corporate purposes, which among other things, are expected to include repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings units or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and/or to replenish cash used to effect such repurchases and purchases. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of 10.8 million shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $96.0 million with an average repurchase price of $8.88 per share. During that period, we redeemed for cash an aggregate of 7.2 million limited partnership units at an average price of $9.10 per unit and an aggregate of 319.2 thousand founding/working partner units at an average price of $8.64 per unit. In the future, we expect to continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock and redeem or purchase BGC Holdings units from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and these repurchases and purchases may be significant.\nTo the extent that we continue to use the net proceeds of the sale of shares of our Class A common stock to fund repurchases of shares and purchases of units, or to replenish cash used to effect repurchases and purchases, net proceeds will not be available for other corporate purposes. In addition, to the extent that we seek to sell shares of our Class A common stock to raise net proceeds for repurchases of shares and purchases of units, depending upon the timing and prices of the repurchases of shares and purchases of units and of the sales of our shares and the liquidity and depth of our market, we may in fact sell a greater aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock, at a lower average price per share, in our offerings than the aggregate number of shares repurchased and units purchased by us and the average price per share or unit that we are paying in such repurchases and purchases. Thus, our strategy may result in an increase in the number of our shares and units outstanding and a decrease in our earnings per share on both a basic and a fully diluted basis.\nNevertheless, our management believes that selling shares of our Class A common stock, and using the net proceeds of such sales to repurchase shares and purchase units, is in our best interest and that of our stockholders. While we believe that we can successfully manage our strategy, and that our share price may in fact increase as we increase the amount of cash available for dividends and share repurchases and unit purchases by paying a portion of the compensation of our employees in the form of partnership units and restricted stock, gradually lowering our compensation expenses for purposes of distributable earnings, and lowering our long-term effective tax rate for distributable earnings, there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful or that we can achieve any or all of such objectives.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. In addition, future sales of shares of Class A common stock by us or selling stockholders could materially adversely affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly, and the market price of our Class A common stock may continue to do so depending upon many factors, including our actual results of operations and perceived prospects, the prospects of our competition and of the financial and commercial real estate markets in general, differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, seasonality, changes in general valuations for companies in our business segments, changes in general economic or market conditions and broad market fluctuations. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations, which may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. Declines in the price of our Class A common stock may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees, including brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals.\nFuture sales of shares of our Class A common stock also could materially adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in connection with public offerings, future acquisitions, strategic alliances, third-party investments and private placements or otherwise, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline significantly.\nIn addition to our sales of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our controlled equity offerings, our acquisition shelf, and our dividend reinvestment plan discussed above, events which could have such an effect include the following:\n\u2022\nIn connection with the issuance of 24,042,599 shares of Class A common stock to Cantor upon the conversion by Cantor of the 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes, we filed an effective resale registration statement for such shares on Form S-3 on June 16, 2015;\n\u2022\nIn connection with the issuance of 23,481,192 shares of Class A common stock upon the closing of the JPI Back-End Merger, we filed an effective resale registration statement for such shares on Form S-3 on January 12, 2016;\n\u2022\nWe may issue shares of Class A common stock upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable debt securities that may be issued by us in the future;\n\u2022\nStockholders may resell shares of Class A common stock issuable by us in connection with (i) the conversion by Cantor of shares of its Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, (ii) the exchange of Cantor\u2019s exchangeable limited partnership interests, (iii) the exchange, redemption, or purchase of partnership units for shares of Class A common stock, including in partnership restructurings, (iv) incentive compensation, including grants of restricted stock, RSUs, and options, and (v) donations of shares by us to The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund; and\n\u2022\nStockholders may resell outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, including sales by Cantor partners who receive distribution rights shares from Cantor, The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund which may receive donated shares from Cantor or others, and our employees and partners who hold our shares, including those received in compensatory arrangements from us or in connection with acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 87487, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BGCP"}
