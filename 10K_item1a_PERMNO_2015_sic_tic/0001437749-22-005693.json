{"cik": "1602658", "company": "Investar Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risk. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the notes thereto, investors should consider the following risks when evaluating whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, whether alone or in combination, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created a worldwide public health crisis. The pandemic, and government and voluntary actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus, have significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, authorities implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus. Government-mandated travel restrictions, closures of schools and businesses, occupancy restrictions, and stay-at-home orders, including in our market areas, significantly disrupted economic activities. These disruptions also caused steep increases in unemployment and decreases in consumer and business spending. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the oil and gas industry, the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Although jurisdictions in which we operate have mostly lifted restrictions, worker shortages, supply chain disruptions, inflation, emergences of viral variants and uneven vaccination rates have impacted the ability of businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity and employment.\nThe pandemic and related economic consequences have adversely impacted and may further adversely impact our workforce, operations, and financial results. The operations of our borrowers, other customers, and suppliers have also been affected. We may experience future financial losses due to a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe risk that financial stress on our borrowers will lead to loan defaults at a rate that is higher than we anticipate;\n\u2022\na further decline in business activity causing decreased demand for our loans and other banking services, which may reduce related income and fees;\n\u2022\nfurther increases in our allowance for loan losses to reflect greater risks of losses;\n\u2022\ndecreases in income resulting from deferrals of loan payments, increases in loan modifications, and waivers or reductions in ATM, overdraft, interchange and other fees;\n\u2022\nreductions in collateral values from their values when the loans were made;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the SBA will not guarantee the PPP loans we originated if it determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which any PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us;\n\u2022\nincreased instability in our deposit base;\n\u2022\nthe risk that economic conditions may disrupt our ability to complete acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincreased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity;\n\u2022\nthird party disruptions, including outages at network providers and other suppliers; and\n\u2022\nlack of availability of employees due to illness.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future is difficult to predict, particularly due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, and depends upon, among other things, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines, the impact of variants of the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nRisks Related to our Business\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected by prevailing economic conditions and geopolitical matters.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or fear of pandemics, or a combination of these or other factors. Additionally, declines in real estate value and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest, disruptions in international trade patterns, and slow growth in sectors of the global economy, as well as acts of terrorism, war and other violence could result, and in the case of the war in Ukraine, has resulted, in disruptions or volatility in the financial markets, which could reduce the value of our assets or reduce liquidity. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity position, and may affect our ability to access capital.\nOur business strategy includes the continuation of our multi-state growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have grown our business primarily through de novo branching and through the acquisition of other financial institutions. Since our bank was founded in June 2006, through December 31, 2021, we have opened 14 de novo branches, completed seven whole bank acquisitions, and acquired two branch locations. We have also expanded our operations outside our historical south Louisiana base and into Texas and Alabama, progressing towards our goal to build a premier regional community bank. We intend to continue pursuing a multi-state growth strategy for our business primarily through attractive acquisition opportunities as well as continue to pursue organic growth throughout our franchise. Our growth prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies when expanding their franchise, including the following:\n\u2022\nDe Novo Branching; Branch Acquisitions. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, our de novo branches can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our de novo branches. We may be unable to accomplish future de novo branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, or other factors. We may also be unable to identify and acquire suitable operating branches. Finally, we have no assurance our de novo branches or branches that we may acquire will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. During the last three fiscal years, we have opened four de novo branches. We do not expect to open de novo branches in 2022.\n\u2022\nExpansion into New Markets. Prior to our acquisition of Mainland in the first quarter of 2019, we operated exclusively in Louisiana. With our acquisition of Mainland, we entered Texas, and we subsequently entered Alabama with our acquisition of Bank of York in November 2019. The financial services industry in these areas is highly competitive, and the challenges of operating in new markets and multiple states may be greater than we anticipate.\n\u2022\nAcquisition and Integration Risks. An acquisition strategy involves substantial risks and uncertainties including:\n\u25e6\nthe time and costs of evaluating potential acquisition candidates and new markets, negotiating transactions, and related diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u25e6\nour ability to continue to finance acquisitions and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u25e6\npotential for acquisition agreements, once signed, not to be completed due to inability to obtain required regulatory approvals, third-party litigation, lack of shareholder approval if required, failure of other conditions to closing, agreement of the parties, or other reasons;\n\u25e6\nunanticipated difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, including potential losses of customers and employees, higher than expected integration costs, and inability to maintain and increase market share at new locations; and\n\u25e6\npotential differences between management\u2019s expectations regarding how an acquired business will perform and actual results once acquired, which may result in lower than expected revenues, inability to achieve expected cost savings and synergies, higher than expected liabilities and costs, impairments of goodwill, and losses.\n\u2022\nOrganic Growth Risks. As we continue to pursue organic growth at our existing and new or acquired locations, we may be unable to successfully maintain loan quality, obtain deposits at attractive rates, attract and retain personnel to implement and oversee such growth, or maintain an efficient overhead cost structure. We may also introduce new products and services that do not produce projected profits and may result in losses.\nFailure to successfully address these issues relating to our growth strategy could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is concentrated in southern Louisiana, southeast Texas, and Alabama, and an economic downturn affecting these areas may magnify the adverse effects and consequences to us.\nWe currently conduct our operations primarily in southern Louisiana, and more specifically, in the Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette and Lake Charles metropolitan areas, in the greater Houston, Texas area, and in Alabama. As of December 31, 2021, our primary markets were south Louisiana (approximately 77% of our total deposits of $2.1 billion), southeast Texas (approximately 9% of our total deposits) and Alabama (approximately 14% of our total deposits). At December 31, 2021, approximately 68%, 5%, and 6% of the secured loans in our total loan portfolio were secured by properties and other collateral located in Louisiana, Texas and Alabama, respectively.\nThis geographic concentration imposes a greater risk to us than to our competitors in the area who maintain significant operations outside of our selected markets. Accordingly, any regional or local economic downturn, or natural or man-made disaster, that affects southern Louisiana, southeast Texas, Alabama, or existing or prospective property or borrowers in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our more geographically diversified competitors.\nMuch of our business development and marketing strategy is directed toward fulfilling the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Such businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If economic conditions negatively impact our selected markets and these businesses are adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nAdverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have a negative effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us.\nCertain industry-specific economic factors may also adversely affect us. For example, the energy sector, which is historically cyclical, has experienced significant volatility in oil and gas prices. While we consider our direct exposure to the energy sector not to be significant, comprising approximately 2.1% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2021, continued oil price volatility could have further negative impacts on general economic conditions, particularly in our south Louisiana and southeast Texas markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of loans secured by real estate, and a downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and negatively impact our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 82% of our total loan portfolio had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan. The real estate provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of a default by the borrower, but its value may deteriorate during the time the credit is extended. Declines in real estate values in our markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower\u2019s obligations to us. Furthermore, in a declining real estate market, we often will need to further increase our allowance for loan losses to address the deterioration in the value of the real estate securing our loans. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCommercial real estate loans may expose us to greater risks than our other real estate loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, which are secured by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial properties. As of December 31, 2021, our owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $460.2 million, or 24.6% of our total loan portfolio and our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $436.2 million, or 23.3% of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial real estate loans typically depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt. Cash flows, either in the form of rental income or the proceeds from sales of commercial real estate, may be affected significantly by general economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may impair the borrower\u2019s business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may increase. High vacancy rates could also result in rents falling. The combination of these factors could result in deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a 1-4 family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCommercial and industrial loans may expose us to greater risk than other loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans primarily consist of working capital lines of credit and equipment loans, typically secured by accounts receivable or inventory, or the relevant equipment. Repayment of these loans generally comes from the generation of cash flow as the result of the borrower\u2019s business operations. Commercial lending generally involves different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction lending. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by business assets (including real estate, if available as collateral), the repayment of these types of loans depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower (and any guarantors). Thus, the general business conditions of the local economy and the borrower\u2019s ability to sell its products and services, thereby generating sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions, are the chief considerations when assessing the risk of a commercial and industrial loan. The liquidation of collateral, if any, is considered a secondary source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may, among other things, be obsolete or of limited resale value.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, as a result, we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty changes in interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, competition for loans and deposits, domestic and international events, changes in the United States and other financial markets, and the policies of the Federal Reserve. Inflation reached a near 40-year high in late 2021, driven in large part by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the Federal Reserve is expected to interest rates one or more times in 2022, which would likely result in an increase in market interest rates. Our earnings depend significantly on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, and our earnings may be adversely affected. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nAdditionally, an increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect our current borrowers\u2019 ability to repay variable rate loans, the demand for and our ability to originate loans, negatively affect the value of our investment securities portfolio, and decrease loan prepayment rates, or could increase the cost of the Company\u2019s deposits and borrowings. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income, but we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nConversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates may lead to, among other things, prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates, lower rates on new loans, lower rates on existing variable rate loans, and lower yields on investment securities, which could result in decreased yields on earning assets. Volatility in interest rates may increase competition for deposits and raise the cost of deposits.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in the general level of market interest rates, we may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect our business. We also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels. For additional information, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Interest Rate Risk.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that the principal of and interest on a loan will not be paid timely or at all and that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover any exposure to loss on a loan. Management maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. We maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses, including collateral impairment, based on our analysis of our portfolio and market environment, using relevant information available to us. Among other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses, management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses as percentages of total loans and nonperforming loans was 1.11% and 70.59%, respectively. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is inherently subjective, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity, and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, loans acquired in connection with business combination transactions are measured at fair value, based on management\u2019s estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. Because fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk, no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date.\nInaccurate management assumptions, including with respect to the fair value of acquired loans, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Finally, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nCommercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or other loans or investments. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of a material amount of these loans may cause a significant increase in our allowance for loan losses, non-performing assets, TDRs and/or past due loans. An increase in our allowance for loan losses, non-performing assets, TDRs, and/or past due loans could result in a loss of earnings, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued a new accounting standard (ASU No. 2016-13), referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) that requires that the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization\u2019s portfolio. In addition, the new standard amends the accounting for credit losses on purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new accounting standard on our financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is likely to result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an \u201cincurred loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. While we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, we expect that the impact of adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts, as of the adoption date. ASU 2016-13 will currently be effective for us, as a smaller reporting company, on January 1, 2023.\nThe FDIC, Federal Reserve and the OCC issued a final rule to allow a banking organization to elect to phase in the regulatory capital impact over a three-year period commencing with time of adoption of the new standard. A failure to effectively measure the impact of the new CECL standard may result in significant overstatement or understatement of our allowance for loan and lease losses, and in the event of an understatement, may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which could adversely affect our net income.\nLoss of our senior executive officers or other key employees and our inability to recruit or retain suitable replacements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued service and skills of our existing executive management team. The implementation of our business and growth strategies also depends significantly on our ability to retain employees with experience and business relationships within their respective market areas, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, particularly in light of the labor shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We could have difficulty replacing key employees with personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business and growth strategies and who have ties to the communities within our market areas. The loss of any of our key personnel could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nOur floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions, and certain of the products we have offered, such as floating-rate loans, determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Regulatory authorities responsible for the administration and publication of LIBOR have announced that the most commonly used LIBOR settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021. Bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks and encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Bank discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and will negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $186.4 million of our outstanding loans, and, in addition, certain derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments, have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts, and could present additional risk. We are subject to litigation and reputational risks if we are unable to renegotiate and amend existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on LIBOR, including contracts that do not have fallback language. The timing and manner in which each customer\u2019s contract transitions to an alternative reference rate will vary on a case-by-case basis. There continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition, including with respect to the acceptance and use of other benchmark rates. Since other benchmark rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility as compared to LIBOR. The transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather conditions, as well as man-made disasters, could negatively affect our local markets or disrupt our operations, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is concentrated in southern Louisiana, in southeast Texas, and in Alabama. Our selected markets are susceptible to major hurricanes, floods, tropical storms, tornadoes and other natural disasters and adverse weather, the nature and severity of which can be difficult to predict. These natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. For example, the historic flooding of Baton Rouge and surrounding areas in August 2016 had significant impacts in several markets in which we conduct business. Hurricane Harvey caused significant damage and flooding in Texas when it made landfall in August 2017. Hurricane Ida, which made landfall as a category 4 hurricane in Louisiana in August 2021, caused significant damage in the southern part of the state and also disrupted operations for certain of our customers. We recognized a material impairment related to a lending relationship with a group of related borrowers (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), collateralized by commercial real estate, inventory, and equipment. As a result of Hurricane Ida, the Borrower\u2019s business operations were disrupted, and due to this impact on the Borrower\u2019s operations, certain of the collateral supporting the loan relationship experienced a significant reduction in value. The severity and impact of future severe weather events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico illustrated that man-made disasters can also adversely affect economic activity in the markets in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of a natural disaster, adverse weather, oil spill or other man-made disaster can reduce the demand for loans and our other products and services.\nSuch events could also affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans (resulting in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses), impair the value of collateral securing such loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nClimate related events and legislative and societal responses regarding climate change present risks to our business.\nClimate change may intensify severe weather events such as hurricanes and rainstorms that recur in our market areas, which may adversely impact our locations and business and those of our customers and suppliers. In addition, there has been an increased focus among businesses, consumers and investors regarding transitioning to renewable energy and a net zero economy. If we fail to adequately anticipate and address these changing preferences, our business could be adversely impacted. We are also subject to risks relating to potential new climate change-related legislation or regulations, which could increase our and our customers\u2019 costs. The risks associated with these matters are continuing to evolve rapidly and the ultimate impact on our business is difficult to predict with any certainty.\nOur failure to effectively implement new technologies could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our ability to compete successfully to some extent depends on whether we can implement new technologies to provide products and services to our customers more efficiently while avoiding significant operational challenges that increase our costs or delay full implementation, especially relative to our peers, many of which have greater resources to devote to technological improvements.\nWe rely on information technology and telecommunications systems, many of which are provided by third-party vendors.\nThe successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems is critical to our business. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing and deposit processing. If one of these third-party service providers terminates their relationship with us or fails to provide services to us for any reason or provides such services poorly, our business may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may be forced to replace such vendors, which could interrupt our operations and result in a higher cost to us.\nCyberattacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nThe financial services industry is particularly at risk for cybersecurity concerns because of the proliferation of new and emerging technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. Additionally, increased use of internet and mobile banking products, such as our Lumen system, and applications and plans to use or develop additional remote connectivity solutions increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure. Additionally, as part of our banking business, we and certain of our third-party vendors collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyberattacks, rapidly emerge and change and are becoming increasingly sophisticated, exposing us to additional costs to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources or by merchants using our customers\u2019 debit and credit cards, software bugs, other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our computer systems and/or our customer accounts could become vulnerable to misappropriation of confidential information, account takeover schemes, ransomware, or cyberfraud. A ransomware attack could potentially shut down our data processing system and prevent us from accessing critical information. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses and malware.\nA breach of security that results in unauthorized access to our data could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws and expose us to disruptions in our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, customer notification requirements, significant increases in compliance and insurance costs, increases in costs for measures to minimize and remediate these risks and breaches, loss of confidence in our security measures, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, and shareholder value.\nWe have attempted to address these concerns by backing up our systems as well as retaining qualified third-party vendors to test and audit our network. However, there can be no guarantees that our efforts and those of our third-party vendors will be successful in avoiding material problems with our information technology and telecommunications systems. We may not be able to anticipate all cyber security breaches or implement effective preventative measures against such breaches.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the Company\u2019s funding costs.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs could increase if the Company loses deposits and replaces them with more expensive sources of funding, if customers shift their deposits into higher cost products, or if the Company needs to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to execute our business strategy.\nIn addition to the liquidity that we require to conduct our day-to-day operations, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet regulatory requirements. Also, we may need capital to finance our growth, including through acquisitions. For example, in 2019, we sold $25.0 million of subordinated notes structured to qualify as tier 2 capital, and $30.0 million of common stock, in part to fund acquisitions.\nOur ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have, including higher total assets and capitalization, a more extensive and established branch network, greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan and deposit pricing. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. Many of these entities have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do. There has been an increasing trend of credit unions acquiring banks. Credit unions are tax-exempt entities which provides an advantage when pricing loans and deposits. The acquisition of banks by credit unions may increase competition for customers and acquisitions.\nOur industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes, as well as continued consolidation. The increased regulatory requirements imposed on financial institutions as well as the economic downturn in the United States in the 2007-2009 time frame, and generally slow recovery thereafter, have already resulted in the consolidation of a number of financial institutions, in addition to acquisitions of failed institutions. We expect additional consolidation to occur. Finally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, pricing and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nIf the goodwill that we record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets we acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nWe determine impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled $40.1 million. While we have not recorded any such impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors outside our control could result in impairment of or losses with respect to our investment securities.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to review our securities portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, our ability and intent to hold securities until a recovery of fair value, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, an increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on the value of our investment securities portfolio. Market volatility may make it difficult to value certain securities. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The primary source of the Bank\u2019s funds are customer deposits and loan repayments, while borrowings are a secondary source of liquidity. Our access to deposits and other funding sources in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms is affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe face significant operational and other risks related to our activities, which could expose us to negative publicity, litigation and/or regulatory action.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including, particularly as a financial institution, fraud risks and human error. Our fraud risks include fraud committed by external parties against the Company or our customers and fraud committed internally by our associates. Certain fraud risks, including identity theft and account takeover, may increase as a result of customers\u2019 accounts or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of retailers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 networks. There are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies, as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies. We may also suffer severe reputational damage. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause the nature of the financial services industry involves a high volume of transactions, certain systems or human errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or associate tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company is further exposed to the risk that our third-party vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations, or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or systems or human errors as we are. These risks include the cybersecurity risks discussed above.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could restrain our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state banking laws and regulations that govern almost all aspects of our operations, including, among other things, our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth. The level of regulatory scrutiny that we are subject to may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration in January 2021. These laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework that oversees the administration of these laws and regulations, are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders and counterparties. Furthermore, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on our operations and our ability to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Our efforts to comply with these additional laws, regulations and standards are likely to result in increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. The information under the heading \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Business, provides more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we and the Bank operate.\nFederal regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. The Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. Failure to comply with any applicable regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage or restrictions on business.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe ECOA, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies enforce these laws and regulations, but private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. If an institution\u2019s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations is found to be deficient, the institution could be subject to damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines, among other sanctions. For example, in 2021, the OCC announced that it had issued enforcement actions against two regional banks relating to Fair Housing Act violations. In addition, the OCC\u2019s assessment of our compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) is taken into account when evaluating any application we submit for, among other things, approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility, an office relocation, a merger or the acquisition of another financial institution. Our failure to satisfy our CRA obligations could, at a minimum, result in the denial of such applications and limit our growth.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies consider the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s anti-money laundering activities and other regulatory compliance matters when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. Accordingly, non-compliance with the applicable regulations could materially impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into or complete mergers and acquisitions.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of fintech innovation.\nFintech developments, such as bitcoin or other types of cryptocurrency and the development of alternative payment systems, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers. On July 31, 2018, the OCC announced it would grant limited-purpose national bank charters to fintech companies that offer bank products and services. The federal charter would allow fintech companies to operate nationwide under a single set of national standards, without needing to seek state-by-state licenses or joining with brick-and-mortar banks, which could have the effect of allowing fintech companies to more easily compete with us for financial products and services in the communities we serve. This decision was subsequently reversed on appeal on procedural grounds. At present, the future of the OCC fintech charter is unclear.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC deposit insurance premiums in the future.\nThe deposits of Investar Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC deposit insurance. A bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on certain financial information and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC has, in the past, increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged a special assessment to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Regulation requires us to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual, anticipated, or unanticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or business conditions, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, or in laws and regulations affecting us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of securities analysts covering us;\n\u2022\nour creditworthiness;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe average daily trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our markets or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of depressed market conditions in the first quarter of 2020, and market conditions have remained volatile since that period. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nShares eligible for future sale could adversely affect market prices of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock eligible for future sale, including those that may be issued in any private or public offering of our common stock, as consideration in acquisition transactions, or as incentives under incentive plans, could adversely affect market prices for our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10,343,494 shares outstanding and 368,481 shares subject to options granted under our incentive plan. On December 20, 2019, we sold 1,290,323 shares of our common stock in a private placement and have registered those shares for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Because our other outstanding shares of common stock either were issued in an offering registered under the Securities Act or have been held for more than one year, such shares are freely tradable, except for shares held by our affiliates (approximately 7% of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021) and 241,070 shares that represent unvested restricted shares under our incentive plan. Shares issued under our incentive plan will be available for sale into the public market, except for shares held by our affiliates. Shares held by our affiliates may be resold subject to the restrictions in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock to raise capital for growth or as consideration in acquisition transactions or for other purposes, and such shares may be registered under the Securities Act and freely tradable or may be issued in a private placement and registered for resale under the Securities Act.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We have no obligation to continue paying dividends, and we may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders. In addition, our existing and future debt agreements limit, or may limit, our ability to pay dividends. Under the terms of our 5.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029, we may not pay a dividend if either our parent company or the Bank, both immediately prior to the declaration of the dividend and after giving effect to the payment of the dividend, would not maintain regulatory capital ratios that are as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d levels for regulatory capital purposes. We are also prohibited from paying dividends upon and during the continuance of any Event of Default under such notes.\nSince the Company\u2019s primary asset is its stock of Investar Bank, we are dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations and to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Accordingly, any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will substantially depend upon the Bank\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common shareholders.\nIn addition, there are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit our and Investar Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends. For further discussion of the regulatory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, see Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Dividends.\nOur Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, and certain banking laws applicable to us, could have an anti-takeover effect that decreases our chances of being acquired, even if our acquisition is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nCertain provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and our by-laws, as amended, and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock. In particular, our board may issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill the vacancies created by the increase;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to amend our by-laws without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover.\nOur shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. The board also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our shareholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to our shareholders.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, an investor may lose some or all of his or her investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14810, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ISTR"}
