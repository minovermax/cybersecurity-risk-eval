Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below.\nWe May Not Be Able To Obtain the Financing We Need To Implement Our Asset Development Programs\nWe presently have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through April 2018, but will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs, including the Water Project, produce revenues. If we cannot raise funds if and when needed, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further financings. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders.\nOur Development Activities Have Not Generated Significant Revenues\nAt present, our development activities include water resource and agricultural development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations.\nWe May Never Generate Significant Revenues or Become Profitable Unless We Are Able to Successfully Implement Programs to Develop Our Land Assets and Related Water Resources\nWe do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs. Regardless of the form of our water development programs, the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties, including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities. Additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for water supplies, and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence.\nThe Development of Our Properties Is Heavily Regulated, Requires Governmental Approvals and Permits That Could Be Denied, and May Have Competing Governmental Interests and Objectives\nIn developing our land assets and related water resources, we are subject to local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, resource protection, environmental impacts, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, construction and similar matters. Our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Further, our development activities require governmental approvals and permits. If such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions, our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted.\nIn this regard, federal government appropriations currently direct the U.S. Department of the Interior (the \"DOI\") to confirm that the Water Project's proposed use of a portion of the railroad right-of-way leased from the ARZC for the Project's conveyance pipeline is within the scope of the original right-of-way grant. According to existing federal law and direction from the DOI in Memorandum Opinion M-23075, a railroad has the authority to grant third party uses of its right-of-way without BLM permitting if those uses will further, in part, a railroad purpose. The Project and pipeline will further numerous railroad purposes by providing fire suppression, hydropower generation creating additional rail transloading opportunities, fiber optic communications, increased traffic, access to water for business operations, and other benefits. In October 2015, the outgoing Director of the BLM's California State Office notified the Company and the ARZC that, in spite of the railroad purposes furthered by the Project pipeline, he had determined that the Project's pipeline is outside the scope of the ARZC right-of-way because the benefits derive from a pipeline that is not an original railroad purpose. The letter also stated that if the Project would like to move ahead with the construction of a pipeline within the ARZC right-of-way, then the Company would need to file a new right-of-way application with the BLM. The October 2015 guidance noted it was not a final determination and could be reconsidered with the presentation of additional information and in the public interest.\nSeveral Members of Congress have raised concerns about the 2015 guidance and have supported legislative language that would clarify federal policy governing third party use of railroad right-of-way over federal lands. We believe that if this language were to be signed into law it will enable third parties, including the Company, to carry on existing and future activities within existing railroad ROWs over federal lands without the need to secure a separate ROW grant. The language is expected to be considered as part of a federal appropriations package in April 2017. If this language is not considered in April 2017, it could be delayed until the Fall of 2017.\nIn addition, prior to construction of the Water Project, terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan, which owns and controls the CRA. Water Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company. Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD. We expect arrangements would be approved by Metropolitan staff and considered by its Board following resolution of BLM discussions related to the conveyance pipeline, discussed above. Once arrangements are reached, Metropolitan must take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.\nFinally, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals. Opposition from third parties will cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third party interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects, certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans and pursue legal action.\nOur Failure to Make Timely Payments of Principal and Interest on Our Indebtedness May Result in a Foreclosure on Our Assets\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness outstanding to our lenders of approximately $112.5 million. Approximately $43.5 million of our indebtedness is secured by our assets and is due in September 2019 (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). To the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations.\nThe Conversion of Our Outstanding Convertible Notes into Common Stock Would Dilute the Percentage of Our Common Stock Held by Current Stockholders\nIn connection with our March 2013 debt refinance (see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\"), we issued approximately $53.5 million in convertible notes, under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $8.05 per share at the election of our noteholders prior to maturity in March 2018 (the \"2018 Convertible Notes\"). In December 2015, certain of the noteholders exchanged their 2018 Convertible Notes for new convertible notes under which principal and accrued interest can be converted into common stock at $6.75 per share at the election of the noteholders prior to a maturity date in March 2020 (the \"2020 Convertible Notes\"). A total of $48.929 million in original principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Notes were exchanged for 2020 Convertible Notes, leaving $3.390 million in original principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Notes outstanding. In April 2016, we issued an additional $8.0 million in original principal amount of the 2020 Notes. As of December 31, 2016, our lenders had converted $8.746 million in original principal amount of the notes, leaving a balance of $52.724 million in original principal amount of these notes. An election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of principal and accrued interest under the 2018 and 2020 Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders up to 10.2 million shares as of December 31, 2016, and up to an additional 2.5 million shares if held to maturity.\nThe Issuance of Equity Securities Under Management Equity Incentive Plans Will Impact Earnings\nOur compensation programs for management emphasize long-term incentives, primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities. It is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares, options, or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval. In the event that any such plans are approved and implemented, the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will, under currently applicable accounting rules, result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award. The expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant.\nThe Volatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates in response to various factors which are beyond our control. Such fluctuations are particularly common in companies such as ours, which have not generated significant revenues. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u00b7\ndevelopments involving the execution of our business plan;\n\u00b7\ndisclosure of any adverse results in litigation;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our ability to develop our properties;\n\u00b7\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional debt or equity financings;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace of our company and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.", "PERMNO": 85570, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CDZI"}
