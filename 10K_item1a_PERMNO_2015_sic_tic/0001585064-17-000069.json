{"cik": "1585064", "company": "Fidelity & Guaranty Life", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-11-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition.\nRisk factors related to the proposed merger with CF Corporation are as follows:\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nAs described in \"Item 1. Business-Overview-Our Company,\" on May 24, 2017, FGL entered into a Merger Agreement by and among CF Corp., Parent and Merger Sub. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity, which will become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Corp. The Merger is subject to closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of regulatory approval from the Iowa Insurance Division.\nA number of the closing conditions are outside of our control and we cannot predict with certainty whether all of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or if other uncertainties may arise. In addition, regulators could impose additional requirements or obligations as conditions for their approvals, which may be burdensome. Despite our best efforts, we may not be able to satisfy the various closing conditions or obtain the necessary waivers or approvals in a timely fashion or at all, in which case the Merger would be prevented or delayed.\nFailure to timely complete the Merger could adversely impact our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to complete the Merger on a timely basis or at all could result in negative publicity and cause the price of our common stock to decline, in particular because our current stock price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will occur. In addition, as a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, trading in our stock has increased substantially. If the Merger is not consummated, the investment goals of our stockholders may be materially different than those of our stockholders on a pre-Merger announcement basis. In addition, we will remain liable for significant transaction costs that will be payable even if the Merger is not completed and could also be required to pay a termination fee to CF Corp in specific circumstances.\nThe pending Merger and operating restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement could adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe proposed Merger and certain interim operating covenants that govern the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business and business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For example, the attention of the Company\u2019s management may be directed to Merger-related considerations, the Company\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company, which may adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel, and parties with which the Company has business relationships, including customers, potential customers and distributors, may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and seek alternative relationships or seek to alter their present business relationships with us in a manner that negatively impacts the Company.\nShareholder litigation against the Company, our directors and/or CF Corp could delay or prevent the Merger and cause us to incur significant costs and expenses.\nTransactions such as the Merger are often subject to lawsuits by shareholders. Conditions to the closing of the Merger include that no law or order shall have been enacted, issued or enforced and in effect, that would prevent or prohibit consummation of the Merger. We cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any potential lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending the claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of lawsuits.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is highly regulated and subject to numerous legal restrictions and regulations.\nState Regulation\nOur business is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which we conduct business and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other customers rather than shareholders. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and discretionary, authority with respect to many aspects of our business, which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers and capital adequacy. At any given time, we and our insurance subsidiaries may be the subject of a number of ongoing financial or market conduct, audits or inquiries. From time to time, regulators raise issues during such examinations or audits that could have a material impact on our business.\nWe have received inquiries from a number of state regulatory authorities regarding our use of the U.S. Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File (\u201cDeath Master File\u201d) and compliance with state claims practices regulations and unclaimed property or escheatment laws. The NYDFS issued a letter and subsequent regulation requiring life insurers doing business in New York to use the Death Master File or similar databases to determine if benefits were payable under life insurance policies, annuities and retained asset accounts. Other states have enacted laws which will impose requirements on insurers to periodically compare their in-force life insurance policies and annuities against the Death Master File or similar databases, investigate any identified potential matches to confirm the death of the insured and determine whether benefits are due and attempt to locate the beneficiaries of any benefits that are due or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the benefit to the state as unclaimed property. We have received notice of escheatment audits from several states. We have filed suit in federal and state court to challenge the audit policies of the California controller and the applicability of California\u2019s unclaimed property laws to FGL generally. It is possible that these requirements will result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws or administrative penalties and expenses. While we believe that we have established sufficient reserves with respect to these matters, it is possible that third parties could dispute these amounts and additional payments or additional unreported claims or liabilities could be required or identified given the ongoing regulatory developments, the effects of which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any one period.\nState insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy and rate filings, market conduct and business practices of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. The regulator in FGL Insurance\u2019s previous state of domicile, the MIA, completed a routine financial examination of FGL Insurance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. The NYDFS completed a routine financial examination of FGL NY Insurance for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2009 and is completing its exam for the period ending December 31, 2012. The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation completed a routine financial examination of Raven Re for the period from April 7, 2011 (commencement of business) through December 31, 2012. FGL Insurance is currently the subject of four ongoing market conduct examinations or inquiries in various states. While FGL Insurance does not believe that any of the current market conduct examinations it is subject to will result in any fines or remediation orders that will be material to its business, market conduct examinations can result in monetary fines or remediation and generally require FGL Insurance to devote significant resources to the management of such examinations. As a result of its re-domestication to Iowa, FGL Insurance became subject to financial and market conduct examinations by the IID, the primary regulatory authority for Iowa domestic life insurance companies.\nNAIC\nAlthough our business is subject to regulation in each state in which we conduct business, in many instances the state regulatory models emanate from the NAIC. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer and at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. We are also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight.\nUnder insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any such future assessments. There is an additional risk that any particular regulator\u2019s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes to the overall legal or market environment, even absent any change of interpretation by a particular regulator, may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve profitability.\nSome of the NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in the various states without affirmative action by the states. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. Also, regulatory actions with prospective impact can potentially have a significant impact on our current product offerings. The NAIC continues to work to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to life insurance reserves. On June 10, 2016, the NAIC formally approved principle-based reserving for life insurance products with secondary guarantees, with an effective date January 1, 2017. A three year transition period is available which delays application of the new guidance until January 1, 2020. Additionally, various statutory accounting guidance is being evaluated, including investment value of insurance subsidiaries.\nFederal Regulation\nIn April 2016, the DOL issued the \u201cfiduciary\u201d rule which could have a material impact on the Company, its products, distribution, and business model. The rule provides that persons who render investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to an employer plan or IRA are fiduciaries of that plan or IRA. The rule expands the definition of fiduciary under ERISA to apply to insurance agents who advise and sell products to IRA owners. As a result, commissioned insurance agents selling the Company\u2019s IRA products must qualify for a prohibited transaction exemption, either the newly introduced BICE or amended PTE 84-24. When fully implemented, BICE would apply to fixed indexed annuities and amended PTE 84-24 would apply to fixed rate annuities. The rule and exemptions have been the subject of much controversy and various actions have been taken by DOL to delay and reconsider aspects of the rule and exemptions. The rule took effect June 2016 and was scheduled to become applicable in April 2017 but the \u201capplicability date\" was delayed by DOL for 60 days from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017. DOL also acted to delay many aspects of the prohibited transaction exemption requirements during a transition period from June 9, 2017 to January 1, 2018 provided the agent (and if applicable, financial institution) comply with \u201cimpartial conduct standards.\u201d The impartial conduct standards essentially require the sale to be in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the client, misleading statements not be made, and compensation be reasonable. More recently, DOL has proposed extending the transition period to July 1, 2019 which at the present time is still under consideration. Industry continues its efforts to overturn the rule in court actions and Congress continues to consider related legislation but the success or failure of these efforts cannot be predicted. Assuming the rule is not overturned and the requirements of the exemptions were to be implemented fully, the impact on the financial services industry generally and on the Company and its business in particular is difficult to assess. We believe however it could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to IRA owners particularly in the independent agent distribution channel. A significant portion of our annuity sales are to IRAs. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemptions when fully phased in would likely require additional supervision of agents, cause changes to compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. FGL Insurance will continue to monitor developments closely and believes it is prepared to execute implementation plans as necessary to meet the rule and exemption requirements on the requisite applicability dates.\nOther Regulation\nOther types of regulation that could affect us include insurance company investment laws and regulations, state adopted statutory accounting principles, antitrust laws, minimum solvency requirements, federal privacy laws, insurable interest laws and federal anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in laws and regulations may materially increase the cost of compliance and other expenses of doing business. There are a number of risks that may arise where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development or where regulations may conflict with one another, where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings, which could result in our failure to meet applicable standards. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which\ncould result, among other things, in suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, appropriately any of these matters, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to additional legal risk, which could increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our business.\nWe cannot predict what form any future changes in these or other areas of regulation affecting the insurance industry might take or what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us if enacted into law. In addition, because our activities are relatively concentrated in a small number of lines of business, any change in law or regulation affecting one of those lines of business could have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to other more diversified insurance companies.\nAccounting rules, changes to accounting rules, or the grant of permitted accounting practices to competitors could negatively impact us.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. GAAP. A number of organizations are instrumental in the development and interpretation of U.S. GAAP, such as the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. U.S. GAAP is subject to constant review by these organizations and others in an effort to address emerging accounting issues and to interpret existing accounting guidance. We cannot assure you that future changes to U.S. GAAP will not have a negative impact on us. U.S. GAAP includes the requirement to carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. These fair values are sensitive to various factors including, but not limited to, interest rate movements, credit spreads, and various other factors. Because of this, changes in these fair values may cause increased levels of volatility in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d). SAP and in particular actuarial reserving methodology are subject to constant review by the NAIC and its task forces and committees as well as state insurance departments in an effort to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial reporting. Various proposals are currently, or have previously been, pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC, some of which, if enacted, would negatively affect our insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC is also currently working to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to life insurance reserves and the accounting for such reserves. We cannot predict whether or in what form reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect us. In addition, the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual provides that state insurance departments may permit insurance companies domiciled therein to depart from SAP by granting them permitted accounting practices. We cannot predict whether or when the insurance departments of the states of domicile of our competitors may permit them to utilize advantageous accounting practices that depart from SAP, the use of which is not permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile of us and our insurance subsidiaries. With respect to regulations and guidelines, states sometimes defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of the state of domicile. Neither the action of the domiciliary state nor action of the NAIC is binding on a state. Accordingly, a state could choose to follow a different interpretation. We can give no assurance that future changes to SAP or components of SAP or the grant of permitted accounting practices to its competitors will not have a negative impact on us.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe indenture governing the 6.375% senior notes due 2021 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) issued by FGLH and the three-year $150 unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d); each contains various restrictive covenants which limit, among other things, FGLH\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or certain other distributions on its capital stock other than as allowed under the indenture and the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nchange our accounting policies;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens.\nIn addition, if FGL or FGLH undergoes a \u201cchange of control\u201d as defined in the indenture, each holder of Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest.\nAs a result of these restrictions and their effect on us, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur could include more restrictive covenants.\nFor detailed information about restrictions governing our debt, see Part II, Item 7. \"Debt\" in this report.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend on the accuracy of a broad range of assumptions and estimates made by our management.\nWe make certain assumptions and estimates regarding mortality, persistency, expenses, interest rates, tax liability, business mix, frequency of claims, contingent liabilities, investment performance, derivative costs and other factors related to our business and anticipated results. We rely on these assumptions and estimates to determine the amounts of deferred acquisition cost (\u201cDAC\u201d) and value of business acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d), policy liabilities and accruals, future earnings and various components of our consolidated balance sheets and income statements. These assumptions are also used in making decisions crucial to the operation of our business, including the pricing of products and expense structures related to products. The calculations we use to estimate various components of our balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations are necessarily complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data. The assumptions and estimates required for these calculations involve judgment and by their nature are imprecise and subject to changes and revisions over time. These assumptions and estimates incorporate many factors, none of which can be predicted with certainty. To the extent our actual experience and changes in estimates differ from original estimates and assumptions, our business, Consolidated Statement of Operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, our results may be adversely affected by changes resulting from implementing more sophisticated administrative systems and procedures that facilitate the calculation of more precise estimates.\nWe have minimal experience to date on policyholder behavior for our GMWB products which we began issuing in 2008; as a result, future experience could lead to significant changes in our assumptions. If emerging experience deviates from our assumptions on GMWB utilization, it could have a significant effect on our reserve levels and related results of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if our assumptions regarding the fair value and future performance of our investments differ from actual experience.\nWe make assumptions regarding the fair value and expected future performance of our investments. It is possible that actual values will differ from our assumptions. Such events could result in a material change in the value of our investments, business, operations and financial condition.\nFor example, expectations that our investments in RMBS and CMBS will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on assumptions a market participant would use in determining the current fair value and considering the performance of the underlying assets. We have non-agency RMBS holdings of $1 billion as of September 30, 2017. It is possible that the collateral underlying these investments will not meet performance expectations and the lower performance levels may lead to adverse changes in the cash flows on our holdings of these types of securities. This could lead to potential future other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") within our portfolio of these securities. In addition, expectations that our investments in corporate securities or debt obligations will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on evidence gathered through our normal credit surveillance process. It is possible that issuers of corporate securities in which we have invested will perform worse than current expectations. Such events may lead us to recognize potential future OTTI within our portfolio of corporate securities. We recorded OTTI charges of approximately $22 and $44 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is also possible that unanticipated events would lead us to dispose of certain of those holdings and recognize the effects of any market movements in our financial statements.\nA financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency, could make our product offerings less attractive and increase our cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious nationally recognized rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer\u2019s ability to meet policyholder and contractholder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to market our products and our competitive position. Any downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could have a materially adverse effect on us in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nadversely affecting relationships with distributors, IMOs and sales agents, which could result in reduction of sales;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number or amount of policy lapses or surrenders and withdrawals of funds;\n\u2022\nrequiring a reduction in prices for our insurance products and services in order to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at a reasonable price, on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to collateralize reserves, balances or obligations under reinsurance and derivatives agreements.\nRating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of these factors relate to the rated company, some factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company\u2019s control. In addition, rating agencies use various proprietary models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have altered their models and may do so in the future in ways that negatively impact the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and make it more difficult to maintain or obtain comparable ratings going forward. As rating agencies continue to evaluate the financial services industry, it is possible that rating agencies will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to financial institutions, increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, request additional information from the companies that they rate and potentially adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. It is possible that the outcome of any such review of us would have additional adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We may need to take actions in response to changing standards or capital requirements set by any of the rating agencies which could cause our business and operations to suffer. If the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are downgraded, we anticipate that our sales of new policies will be adversely impacted and that we could experience substantial surrenders of existing policies. In order to improve or maintain their financial strength ratings, our insurance subsidiaries may limit the amount of dividends that they would otherwise pay to us. In that regard, we may, among other things, implement business strategies to improve the RBC ratio of our insurance subsidiaries to a level anticipated by the rating agencies to maintain or improve our current rating. If we are unable to achieve this level, we may limit dividend payments from FGL Insurance to the extent necessary. We cannot guarantee these measures will be successful, and if FGL Insurance fails to maintain such a target RBC ratio, its financial strength rating could suffer. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take in the future, and failure to improve or maintain current financial strength ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the announcement of the CF Corp Merger Agreement on May 24, 2017, the rating organizations have undertaken a review of our debt ratings and our insurance company subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength ratings. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative. Such actions are beyond FGL's control and FGL cannot predict what these actions may be and the timing thereof.\nWe are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice under our over-the-counter derivative agreements on forms promulgated by the ISDA. Under some ISDA agreements, we have agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels provides the counterparty under the agreement the right to terminate the open derivative contracts between the parties, at which time any amounts payable by us or the counterparty would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. Our current rating allows multiple counterparties the right to terminate ISDA agreements. As of September 30, 2017, the amount at risk for ISDA agreements which could be terminated based upon our current ratings was $413, which equals the fair value to us of the open over-the-counter call option positions. The fair value of the call options can never decrease below zero. No ISDA agreements have been terminated, although the counterparties have\nreserved the right to terminate the ISDA agreements at any time. In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post collateral when the net exposures exceed predetermined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating but are generally zero. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $381 and $128, respectively, of collateral was posted by our counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $32 and $148 at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdditionally, under certain insurance reserve financing arrangements, if FGLH were to take certain actions without the counterparties consent, and such actions resulted in a specified financial strength ratings downgrade, FGLH would be in default.\nSee \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk\u201d.\nThe amount of statutory capital that our insurance subsidiaries have and the amount of statutory capital that they must hold to maintain their financial strength ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time due to a number of factors outside of our control.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for life insurance companies that establish capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate, and certain other risks.\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, most of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions);\n\u2022\nthe amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth;\n\u2022\nchanges in reserve requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nour ability to access capital markets to provide reserve relief;\n\u2022\nchanges in equity market levels;\n\u2022\nthe value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit ratings of investments held in our portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe value of certain derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\n\u2022\ncredit market volatility;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer behavior; and\n\u2022\nchanges to the RBC formulas and interpretation of the NAIC instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies.\nThe financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are significantly influenced by their statutory surplus amounts and capital adequacy ratios. Rating agencies may also implement changes to their internal models, which differ from the RBC capital model, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold in order to maintain their current ratings. In addition, rating agencies may downgrade the investments held in our portfolio, which could result in a reduction of our capital and surplus and our RBC ratio.\nIn extreme equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold for fixed indexed products may decrease at a rate less than the rate of change of the market value of the invested assets. This mismatch could result in a reduction of the capital, surplus or RBC ratio of our insurance subsidiaries. To the extent that an insurance subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratios are deemed to be insufficient, we may take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If we are unable to take such actions, the rating agencies may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade.\nWhile the amount of statutory reserves is not directly affected by changes in market interest rates, additional statutory reserves may be required as the result of an asset adequacy analysis, and this analysis of cash flow testing is altered by rising or falling interest rates and widening credit spreads.\nThe failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decline in RBC ratios also limits the ability of an insurance subsidiary to make dividends or distributions to us and could be a factor in causing rating agencies to downgrade the insurer\u2019s financial strength ratings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to grow depends in large part upon the continued availability of capital.\nOur insurance subsidiaries\u2019 long-term strategic capital requirements will depend on many factors, including their accumulated statutory earnings and the relationship between their statutory capital and surplus and various elements of required capital. To support long-term capital requirements, we and our insurance subsidiaries may need to increase or maintain statutory capital and surplus through financings, which could include debt, equity, financing arrangements or other surplus relief transactions. Adverse market conditions have affected and continue to affect the availability and cost of capital from external sources. We are not obligated, may choose not, or may not be able to provide financing or make capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. Consequently, financings, if available at all, may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us or our insurance subsidiaries. If our insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain adequate capital, they may be required to limit growth in sales of new policies, and such action could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe and HRG may be the target of future litigation, law enforcement investigations or increased regulatory scrutiny.\nThe financial services industry, including the insurance sector, is sometimes the target of law enforcement and regulatory investigations or other actions resulting from such investigations. Resulting publicity about any such investigation or action may generate inquiries or investigations into or litigation against other financial services companies, even those who do not engage in the business lines or practices at issue in the original action. Responding to these inquiries, investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our management from its business.\nFuture legislation or regulation or governmental views on business practices in the financial services industry may result in our altering our practices in ways that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. It is impossible to predict the outcome of such investigations or actions, whether they will expand into other areas not yet contemplated, whether they will result in changes in regulation, whether activities currently thought to be lawful will be characterized as unlawful, or the impact, if any, of such scrutiny on the financial services and insurance industry or on us. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny, pending or future investigations by regulators or law enforcement agencies and/or legal proceedings involving us or our affiliates can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of employees, and on business retention and new sales, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFinancial services companies are frequently the targets of litigation, including class action litigation, which could result in substantial judgments.\nWe, like other financial services companies, are involved in litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not believe that the outcome of any such litigation or arbitration will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, it is possible our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome. More generally, we operate in an industry in which various practices are subject to scrutiny and potential litigation, including class actions. In addition, we sell our products through IMOs, whose activities may be difficult to monitor. Civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers and other financial services companies involving sales, underwriting practices, product design, product disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees, recommending unsuitable products to customers, breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers, refund or claims practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise representatives, relationships with agents or other persons with whom the insurer does business, payment of sales or other contingent commissions and other matters. Such lawsuits can result in substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of\npunitive non-economic compensatory damages. In some states, juries, judges and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive and non-economic compensatory damages, which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration. Arbitration awards are subject to very limited appellate review. In addition, in some class action and other lawsuits, financial services companies have made material settlement payments.\nOur reinsurers, including Wilton Re and FSRCI, could fail to meet assumed obligations, increase their rates, or become subject to adverse developments that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiaries cede material amounts of insurance and transfer related assets and certain liabilities to other insurance companies through reinsurance. For example, a material amount of reinsured liabilities are concentrated with Wilton Re and FSRCI. As of September 30, 2017, the amount recoverable from Wilton Re and FSRCI was $1,535 and $1,016, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, the reserves ceded to Wilton Re and FSRCI were $1,477 and $1,016, respectively. Given our significant concentration of reinsurance with Wilton Re, if Wilton Re fails to perform its obligations under the various reinsurance treaties, such failure could have a material impact on our financial position. See \u201cBusiness- Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction\u201d. However, notwithstanding the transfer of related assets and certain liabilities, we remain liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to pay under the terms of reinsurance agreements with us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. To mitigate the counterparty risk for the FSRCI transaction, the assets are held on FGL Insurance's balance sheet and are used as collateral in the event of a failure. For Wilton Re, A+ rated from Fitch, we monitor the credit rating. During 2014 Wilton Re announced their purchase by Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, (\"CCIB\"), an AAA rated organization. With the capital resources of CCIB behind Wilton Re, we believe the counterparty risk is low. See \u201cBusiness- Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction\u201d.\nOur ability to compete is dependent on the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, both of which could involve the use of reinsurance affiliates referred to generally as \u201ccaptives\u201d. Premium rates charged by us are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for the reinsurance. Therefore, if the cost of reinsurance were to increase, if reinsurance were to become unavailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all, if alternatives to reinsurance were not available to us, if the use of captives were materially restricted through regulation, including certain general proposals currently under consideration by the NAIC, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe credit for reinsurance taken by our insurance subsidiaries under offshore reinsurance agreements is, under certain conditions, dependent upon the offshore reinsurer\u2019s ability to obtain and provide sufficient qualifying assets in a qualifying trust or qualifying letters of credit issued by qualifying lending banks. The cost of letters of credit, when available, continues to be very expensive in the current economic environment. Loss of reserve credit by an insurance subsidiary would require it to establish additional reserves and would result in a decrease in the level of its capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, access to reinsurance has become more costly for members of the insurance industry, including us. In addition, the number of life reinsurers has decreased as the reinsurance industry has consolidated. The decreased number of participants in the life reinsurance market resulted in increased concentration of risk for insurers, including us. If the reinsurance market further contracts, our ability to continue to offer our products on terms favorable to us could be negatively impacted, resulting in adverse consequences to our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, reinsurers are facing many challenges regarding illiquid credit or capital markets, investment downgrades, rating agency downgrades, deterioration of general economic conditions and other factors negatively impacting the financial services industry generally. If such events cause a reinsurer to fail to meet its obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRestrictions on our ability to use captive reinsurers could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to review life insurance companies\u2019 use of affiliated captive reinsurers or off-shore entities. On June 4, 2014, Rector & Associates, a consulting firm commissioned by the NAIC, presented a revised report (the \u201cRector Report\u201d) to the Principle-Based Reserving Implementation Task Force of the NAIC which proposes a new regulatory framework for captives assuming term life insurance (\u201cXXX\u201d) or universal life insurance with secondary guarantees (\u201cAXXX\u201d) business, and recommends, among other things, placing limitations on the types of assets that may be used to finance reserves associated with XXX and AXXX business and making an individual state\u2019s adoption of the new regulations contemplated by the report an NAIC accreditation standard. On August 17, 2014, the NAIC Executive (EX) Committee adopted the regulatory framework proposed by the Rector Report, including recommendations to have various NAIC technical subgroups propose regulations and guidelines to implement the new framework. These technical working groups are in various stages of developing and proposing regulations and guidelines. On October 9, 2014, the NAIC\u2019s Principle-Based Reserving Implementation Task Force voted to expose for comment a new Actuarial Guideline (AG48) designed to implement many of the recommendations in the Rector Report related to the amount of assets that may be supported by different asset classes in connection with certain transactions involving captive reinsurance companies. AG48 was adopted effective January 1, 2015 and did not materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements or actuarial opinion.\nIf state insurance regulators restrict the use of captive reinsurers or if we otherwise are unable to continue to use captive reinsurers in the future, our ability to write certain products, to manage the associated risks and to deploy capital efficiently, could be adversely affected, or we may need to increase prices on those products, which could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations.\nInterest rate fluctuations and withdrawal demands in excess of our assumptions could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer certain products that allow policyholders to withdraw their funds under defined circumstances. In order to meet such funding obligations, we manage our liabilities and configure our investment portfolios so as to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support expected withdrawal demands and contract benefits and maturities. However, in order to provide necessary long-term returns, a certain portion of our assets are relatively illiquid. There can be no assurance that withdrawal demands will match our estimation of withdrawal demands, however in an effort to mitigate this risk we assess surrender charges on withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts that occur prior to surrender expiration. As interest rates increase, we are exposed to the risk of financial disintermediation through a potential increase in the number of withdrawals. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. If we experience unexpected withdrawal activity, whether as a result of interest rate movements, financial strength downgrades or otherwise, we could exhaust our liquid assets and be forced to liquidate other less liquid assets, possibly at a loss or on other unfavorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may experience spread compression, and a loss of anticipated earnings, if credited interest rates are increased on renewing contracts in an effort to decrease or manage withdrawal activity.\nInterest rates are subject to volatility and fluctuations. For the past several years, interest rates have trended downwards to historically low levels. In order to meet our policy and contractual obligations, we must earn a sufficient return on our invested assets. A prolonged period of historically low rates or significant changes in interest rates could expose us to the risk of not achieving sufficient return on our invested assets by not achieving anticipated interest earnings, or of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies and contracts. Additionally, a prolonged period of low interest rates in the future may lengthen liability maturity, thus increasing the need for a re-investment of assets at yields that are below the amounts required to support guarantee features of our contracts. Both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect our interest earnings and spread income (the difference between the returns we earn on our investments and the amounts we must credit to policyholders and contractholders). While we develop and maintain asset liability management (\u201cALM\u201d) programs and procedures designed to mitigate the effect on interest earnings and spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments, no assurance can be given that changes in interest rates will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expectation for future interest earnings and spread income is an important component in amortization of DAC and VOBA and significantly lower interest earnings or spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization,\nthereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. An extended period of declining interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates may also cause us to change our long-term view of the interest rates that we can earn on our investments. Such a change in our view would cause us to change the long-term interest rate that we assume in our calculation of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. This revision would result in increased reserves and other unfavorable consequences. In addition, while the amount of statutory reserves is not directly affected by changes in market interest rates, additional statutory reserves may be required as the result of an asset adequacy analysis, which is altered by rising or falling interest rates and widening credit spreads.\nAdditionally, our ALM programs and procedures incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates and relationships between risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity and other factors. The effectiveness of our ALM programs and procedures may be negatively affected whenever actual results differ from these assumptions.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the attractiveness of certain of our products. For example, lower interest rates may result in decreased sales of certain of our insurance and investment products. However, during periods of declining interest rates, certain life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year during a period when our investments carry lower returns. As a result, we could become unable to earn our desired level of spread income.\nDuring periods of increasing market interest rates, we may offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities, and we may increase crediting rates on in-force products to keep these products competitive. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six- to twelve-month time period, certain of our products may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Higher interest rates may increase the cost of debt and other obligations having floating rate or rate reset provisions and may result in lower sales of other products. A rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the gross unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio which will decrease our accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity. Our gross unrealized loss on our available for sale (\"AFS\") portfolio was $139 as of September 30, 2017 compared to $269 as of September 30, 2016.\nOur investments are subject to market and credit risks. These risks could be heightened during periods of extreme volatility or disruption in financial and credit markets.\nOur invested assets and derivative financial instruments are subject to risks of credit defaults and changes in market values. Periods of extreme volatility or disruption in the financial and credit markets could increase these risks. Underlying factors relating to volatility affecting the financial and credit markets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe value of our mortgage-backed investments depends in part on the financial condition of the borrowers and tenants for the properties underlying those investments, as well as general and specific economic trends affecting the overall default rate. We are also subject to the risk that cash flows resulting from the payments on pools of mortgages that serve as collateral underlying the mortgage-backed securities we own may differ from our expectations in timing or size. Cash flow variability arising from an unexpected acceleration in mortgage prepayment behavior can be significant, and could cause a decline in the estimated fair value of certain \u201cinterest-only\u201d securities within our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Any event reducing the estimated fair value of these securities, other than on a temporary basis, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant continued financial and credit market volatility, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit defaults, real estate values, market illiquidity, declines in equity prices, acts of corporate malfeasance, ratings downgrades of the issuers or guarantors of these investments and declines in general economic conditions, either alone or in combination, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, OTTI, changes in unrealized loss positions and increased demands on capital. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, we had gross unrealized losses on our AFS portfolio of $139 and $269, respectively. In addition, our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain industries. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, our most significant investment in one industry was our investment securities in the banking industry\nwith a fair value of $2,827 and $2,448, or 12% and 12%, respectively, of the invested assets portfolio. Our holdings in this industry include investments in 115 and 97 different issuers as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the top ten investments accounting for 30% and 34% of the total holdings in this industry as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult for us to value certain of our assets, especially if trading becomes less frequent. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on call options. We seek to reduce the risk associated with such agreements by purchasing such options from large, well-established financial institutions, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the event of counterparty non-performance. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $381 and $128, respectively, of collateral was posted by our counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $32 and $148 at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See \"Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments\" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of credit risk.\nEquity market volatility could negatively impact our business.\nEquity market volatility can negatively affect our revenues and profitability in various ways, particularly as a result of guaranteed minimum withdrawal or surrender benefits in our products. The estimated cost of providing GMWB incorporates various assumptions about the overall performance of equity markets over certain time periods. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets or increased equity volatility could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in a reduction in our revenues and net income. The rate of amortization of DAC and VOBA relating to FIA products and the cost of providing guaranteed minimum withdrawal or surrender benefits could also increase if equity market performance is worse than assumed, hence materially and adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nCredit market volatility or disruption could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant volatility or disruption in credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads could cause market price and cash flow variability in the fixed income instruments in our investment portfolio. Significant volatility and lack of liquidity in the credit markets could cause issuers of the fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio to default on either principal or interest payments on these securities. Additionally, market price valuations may not accurately reflect the underlying expected cash flows of securities within our investment portfolio.\nChanges in federal or state tax laws may affect sales of our products and profitability.\nThe annuity and life insurance products that we market generally provide the policyholder with certain federal income or state tax advantages. For example, federal income taxation on any increases in non-qualified annuity contract values (i.e., the \u201cinside build-up\u201d) is deferred until it is received by the policyholder. Non-qualified annuities are annuities that are not sold to a qualified retirement plan. With other savings investments, such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds, the increase in value is generally taxed each year as it is realized. Additionally, life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax.\nFrom time to time, various tax law changes have been proposed that could have an adverse effect on our business, including the elimination of all or a portion of the income tax advantages described above for annuities and life insurance. Additionally, insurance products, including the tax favorable features of these products, generally must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold. This review could delay the introduction of new products or impact the features that provide for tax advantages and make such products less attractive to potential purchasers. If legislation were enacted to eliminate the tax deferral for annuities, such a change would have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell non-qualified annuities.\nWe may be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and may face restrictions on our ability to fully utilize such assets which could materially adversely affect our capital position, business, operations and financial condition.\nDeferred tax assets refer to assets that are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets in essence represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. The realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent\nupon the generation of sufficient future taxable income, including capital gains. If it is determined that the deferred tax assets cannot be realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance must be established, with a corresponding charge to net income.\nBased on our current assessment of future taxable income, including available tax planning opportunities, we anticipate that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our deferred tax assets as to which we do not have a valuation allowance. If future events differ from our current forecasts, the valuation allowance may need to be increased from the current amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital position, business, operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to an additional tax as a personal holding company on future undistributed personal holding company income if we generate passive income in excess of operating expenses (subject to certain exclusions relating to our life insurance subsidiaries).\nSection 541 of the Code subjects a corporation (not including a life insurance corporation) that is a \u201cpersonal holding company\u201d (\u201cPHC\u201d) to a 20% tax on \u201cundistributed personal holding company income\u201d in addition to a corporation\u2019s normal income tax. A corporation (not including a life insurance corporation) is also generally is considered to be a PHC if (i) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income (excluding dividends paid by any non-consolidated life insurance subsidiary) is PHC Income (defined below) and (ii) more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (including, for this purpose, certain organizations and trusts) at any time during the last half of the taxable year. Personal holding company income (\u201cPHC Income\u201d) is comprised primarily of passive investment income (but does not include non-passive income such as insurance premiums or dividends paid by any non-consolidated life insurance subsidiary) plus, under certain circumstances, personal service income.\nSo long as individuals and their affiliates hold (directly or by attribution) more than 50% in value of our outstanding common stock, including through ownership of the outstanding common stock of HRG at any time during any future tax year, it is possible that we will be a PHC if at least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross income consists of PHC Income (taking into account the rules and exclusions discussed above). In the past, we have not incurred the PHC tax. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to this tax in the future, which, in turn, may materially and adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur business model depends on the performance of various third parties, including independent distributors, underwriters, actuarial consultants and other service providers.\nWe rely significantly on various third parties to provide services for our business operations. As such, our results may be affected by the performance of those other parties. For example, we are dependent upon independent distribution channels to sell our products, third parties to perform policy administration and underwriting functions, and independent consultants to perform actuarial analyses and to manage certain of our assets. Additionally, our operations are dependent on various service providers and on various technologies, some of which are provided or maintained by certain key outsourcing partners and other parties.\nMany of our products and services are complex and are sold through third-party intermediaries. In particular, our insurance businesses are reliant on these intermediaries to describe and explain their products to potential customers. The intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials or other external communications, or inappropriate activities by our personnel or an intermediary, could adversely affect our reputation and business prospects, as well as lead to potential regulatory actions or litigation.\nThe third parties upon which we depend may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, loss of key personnel, or other reasons. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of these other parties may act, or be deemed to act, on behalf of us or represent us in various capacities. Consequently, we may be held responsible for obligations that arise from the acts or omissions of these other parties.\nOur business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships.\nIn addition to services provided by third-party asset managers and actuarial consultants, we outsource the following functions to third-party service providers, and expect to continue to do so in the future: (i) new business administration, (ii) hosting of financial systems, (iii) servicing of existing policies, (iv) information technology development and maintenance, (v) call centers and (vi) underwriting administration of life insurance applications. If we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third-party providers do not perform as contracted, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our reliance on third-party service providers that we do not control does not relieve us of our responsibilities and requirements. Any failure or negligence by such third-party service providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in us becoming subjected to liability to parties who are harmed and ensuing litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any such litigation may be uncertain.\nMoreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely affect our reputation and sales of our products.\nThe loss of key personnel could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people. Intense competition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. Our key employees include investment professionals, such as portfolio managers, sales and distribution professionals, actuarial and finance professionals and information technology professionals. While we do not believe that the departure of any particular individual would cause a material adverse effect on our operations, the unexpected loss of several of our senior management, portfolio managers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, and their years of industry experience as well as the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. We also rely upon the knowledge and experience of employees involved in functions that require technical expertise in order to provide for sound operational controls for our overall enterprise, including the accurate and timely preparation of required regulatory filings and U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements and operation of internal controls. A loss of such employees could adversely impact our ability to execute key operational functions and could adversely affect our operational controls, including internal controls over financial reporting.\nInterruption or other operational failures in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, including as a result of human error, could harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on automated and information technology systems to record and process our internal transactions and transactions involving our customers, as well as to calculate reserves, value-invested assets and complete certain other components of our U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements. We could experience a failure of one of these systems, our employees or agents could fail to monitor and implement enhancements or other modifications to a system in a timely and effective manner, or our employees or agents could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing a new software system or implementing modifications to an existing system. Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. We may also be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses and electrical/telecommunications outages). All of these risks are also applicable where we rely on outside vendors, including NTT Data (formerly \"Dell\"), to provide services to us and our customers. The failure of any one of these systems for any reason, or errors made by our employees or agents, could in each case cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could harm our reputation, adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe retain confidential information in our information technology systems and those of our business partners, and we rely on industry standard commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins,\nand similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. While we perform annual penetration tests and have adopted a number of measures to protect the security of customer and company data and have not experienced a successful cyber-attack, there is no guaranty that such an attack will not occur or be successful in the future. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems that results in inappropriate access, use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter purchases of our products, subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny or significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our information technology systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers, or business partners for an extended period of time. Even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur risk management policies and procedures could leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business or result in losses.\nWe have developed risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to enhance these in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage both internal and external risks may not effectively mitigate these risks or predict future exposures, which could be different or significantly greater than expected. These identified risks may not be the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, we hedge our FIA index credits with a combination of static and dynamic strategies, which can result in earnings volatility. In addition, our FIA hedging strategy economically hedges the equity returns and exposes us to the risk that unhedged market exposures result in divergence between changes in the fair value of the liabilities and the hedging assets.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nA general economic slowdown could adversely affect us in the form of changes in consumer behavior and pressure on our investment portfolios. Concerns over the Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus plan, the slow economic recovery, the level of U.S. national debt, the global economic concerns and financial sector issues, sluggish job growth and wage stagnation, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. housing market, inflation levels, and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. Even under relatively favorable economic and market conditions, demand for our products, as well as our investment returns, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other fluctuations and overall economic and political conditions. Our top five states for the distribution of our products are California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Michigan, and, as a result, any adverse economic developments in these states could have an adverse impact on our business. As a result of these and other concerns, consumer behavior could change, potentially resulting in decreased demand for our products and elevated levels of policy lapses, policy loans, withdrawals and surrenders. In addition, our investments, including investments in mortgage-backed securities, could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove\nsuccessful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could adversely impact our business and its ability to compete effectively.\nWe also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon that party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages or we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to the risks of natural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics and malicious and terrorist acts that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics and malicious and terrorist acts present risks that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. A natural or man-made catastrophe, pandemic or malicious or terrorist act could materially adversely affect the mortality or morbidity experience of our business or our reinsurers. Claims arising from such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition, either directly or as a result of their effect on our reinsurers or other counterparties. Such events could also have an adverse effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies. While we have taken steps to identify and manage these risks, such risks cannot be predicted with certainty, nor fully protected against even if anticipated. In addition, such events could result in overall macroeconomic volatility or specifically a decrease or halt in economic activity in large geographic areas, adversely affecting the marketing or administration of our business within such geographic areas or the general economic climate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The possible macroeconomic effects of such events could also adversely affect our asset portfolio.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could limit our ability to gain or maintain our position in the industry and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We encounter significant competition in all of our product lines from other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources and higher financial strength ratings than us and which may have a greater market share, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have different profitability expectations than us. Competition could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.\nOur annuity products compete with fixed indexed, fixed rate and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank investments and other retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks and broker-dealers. Our insurance products compete with those of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of factors, including premium rates, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distribution channels and policyholders, ratings by rating agencies, reputation and commission structures.\nConsolidation in the insurance industry and in distribution channels may result in increasing competitive pressures on us. Larger, potentially more efficient organizations may emerge from such consolidation. In addition, some mutual insurance companies have converted to stock ownership, which gives them greater access to capital markets and greater ability to compete. The ability of banks to increase their securities-related business or to affiliate with insurance companies may materially and adversely affect sales of all of our products by substantially increasing the number and financial strength of potential competitors. Consolidation and expansion among banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies with which we do business could also have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition if they demand more favorable terms than we previously offered or if they elect not to continue to do business with us following consolidation or expansion.\nOur ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to develop competitive and profitable products, our ability to maintain low unit costs, and our maintenance of adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Our ability to compete is also dependent upon, among other things, our ability to attract and retain distribution channels to market our products, the competition for which is vigorous. We compete for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and\nproduct features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than we do. Our competitiveness for such marketers and agents also depends upon the long-term relationships we develop with them. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers and agents to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues will suffer.\nOur ability to maintain competitive policy expense costs is dependent upon the level of new sales and persistency of existing business.\nOur ability to maintain competitive policy expense costs is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the level of new sales, persistency of existing business and expense management. A decrease in sales or persistency without a corresponding reduction in expenses may result in higher policy expense costs.\nIn addition, lower persistency may result in higher or more rapid amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would result in higher unit costs and lower reported earnings. Although many of our products contain surrender charges, such charges decrease over time and may not be sufficient to cover the unamortized DAC and VOBA costs with respect to the insurance policy or annuity contract being surrendered. Refer to the deferred annuity account values and surrender charge protection disclosure included within \"Item 1. Business, Fixed Rate Annuities.\"\nThere may be adverse consequences if the independent contractor status of our IMOs is successfully challenged.\nWe sell our products through a network of approximately 200 IMOs representing approximately 37,000 independent agents and managing general agents. We currently treat these IMOs as independent contractors who own their own businesses. However, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status of the IMOs are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities. If a federal, state or local authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations or adopts an interpretation that changes the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws, regulations or interpretations, including, in respect of tax withholding, social security payments and recordkeeping, or we could be held liable for the actions of such independent contractors or may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state or local tax or employment laws. Further, if it were determined that our IMOs should be treated as employees, we could possibly incur additional liabilities with respect to any applicable employee benefit plan.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain national marketing organizations and independent agents, sales of our products may be reduced.\nWe must attract and retain our network of IMOs and independent agents to sell our products. Insurance companies compete vigorously for productive agents. We compete with other life insurance companies for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than we do. Our competitiveness for such marketers and agents also depends upon the long-term relationships we develop with them. Our most important IMOs (those who are able to meet certain production targets) are referred to as \u201cPower Partners\u201d. We currently have 32 Power Partners that accounted for approximately 95% of our Fiscal 2017 sales volume. There can be no guaranty that such relationships will continue in the future. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of marketers and agents to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues would suffer.\nOur subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of their obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy their obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance their debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, depends on their financial condition and operating performance, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond their control. Our subsidiaries may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit them to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on indebtedness.\nIf our subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our subsidiaries\u2019 debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our subsidiaries\u2019 debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing and future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments on outstanding obligations on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our ratings, which could harm our ability to conduct our business and to incur additional indebtedness. In the face of such substantial liquidity problems, we may be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any obligations then due.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own. As a consequence, our ability to pay dividends on our stock will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, which may be restricted by law.\nWe are a holding company with limited business operations of our own. Our primary subsidiaries are insurance subsidiaries that own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations. Accordingly, our payment of dividends is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to meet our obligations and pay dividends. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and legal and contractual restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions and the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation-Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations\u201d. The Iowa insurance law and the New York insurance law regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, respectively. This could limit both our ability to receive cash flow from our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, FGLH, FGLH\u2019s ability to receive cash flow from its direct wholly-owned subsidiary, FGL Insurance, and FGL Insurance\u2019s ability to receive cash flow from its direct wholly-owned subsidiary, FGL NY Insurance.\nEach year FGL Insurance may pay a certain limited amount of ordinary dividends or other distributions without being required to obtain the prior consent of the Iowa Commissioner. FGL Insurance is required to provide advance written notice to the Iowa Commissioner of its intention to pay dividends that are deemed ordinary dividends and to request approval to pay dividends that are deemed extraordinary dividends. Pursuant to Iowa insurance law, ordinary dividends are payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, that do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of FGL Insurance\u2019s statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (ii) the net gain from operations of FGL Insurance (excluding realized capital gains) for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. Dividends may only be paid out of statutory earned surplus.\nDividends in excess of FGL Insurance\u2019s ordinary dividend capacity are referred to as extraordinary and require prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. In deciding whether to approve a request to pay an extraordinary dividend, Iowa insurance law requires the Iowa Commissioner to consider the effect of the dividend payment on FGL Insurance\u2019s surplus and financial condition generally and whether the payment of the dividend will cause FGL Insurance to fail to meet its required RBC ratio. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. FGL Insurance has not paid out extraordinary dividends since 2008, and in the future FGL Insurance may be required to request approval to pay an extraordinary dividend and there is no guarantee such a request would be approved by the Iowa Commissioner.\nIt is possible that in the future, our insurance subsidiaries may be unable to pay dividends or distributions to us in an amount sufficient to meet our obligations or to pay dividends due to a lack of sufficient statutory net gain from operations, a diminishing statutory policyholders surplus, changes to the Iowa or New York insurance laws or regulations or for some other reason. Further, the covenants in the agreement governing the existing indebtedness of FGLH significantly restrict its ability to pay dividends, which further limits our ability to obtain cash or other assets from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries cannot pay sufficient dividends or distributions to us in the future, we would be unable to meet our obligations or to pay dividends. This would negatively affect our business and financial condition as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nindustry or general market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international political and economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\naction by institutional shareholders or other large shareholders, such as HRG, including sales of large blocks of common stock;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, rules or regulations, regulatory actions affecting us and other dynamics; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility over time that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares by existing shareholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of September 30, 2017, we have 58,933 thousand outstanding shares of common stock. The 9,750 thousand shares sold pursuant to the Company\u2019s initial public offering (\"IPO\") on December 13, 2013, as well as the additional 1,463 thousand options granted to the underwriters that was subsequently exercised, became immediately tradable without restriction under the Securities Act unless held by \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The remaining 47,720 thousand shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will be eligible for resale subject to applicable volume, means of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144. We also have entered into a registration rights agreement with HRG pursuant to which HRG is able to require us to register shares it holds for resale. We have filed and intend to file registration statements under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201cOmnibus Plan\u201d) and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options and vesting of unvested restricted shares granted under the Omnibus Plan will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. A total of 2,838 thousand shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. At September 30, 2017, 603 thousand shares remain available for future issuance under the Omnibus Plan.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or fixed maturity securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, and litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We are currently covered by one or more securities analysts, but there is no guarantee such coverage will continue. If one or more of the analysts covering our stock downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, HRG and its affiliates, including in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, member or partner of HRG and its affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nThe policies relating to corporate opportunities and transactions with HRG are set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, address potential conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and HRG and its affiliates on the other hand. Our certificate of incorporation provides that HRG and its affiliates, including in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, member or partner of HRG and its affiliates, will not have any obligation to present to us, and HRG may separately pursue, or present to other of its subsidiaries, corporate opportunities of which they become aware, even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity. This includes FSRCI, which may, for example, be interested in pursuing acquisitions of blocks of business or insurance companies that we may also be interested in pursuing. By becoming one of our shareholders, holders of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to these provisions of our certificate of incorporation. Although these provisions are designed to resolve conflicts between us and HRG and our respective affiliates fairly, conflicts may not be so resolved.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution of the percentage ownership of the holders of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nPrior to our IPO in December 2013, we operated as a private company, or as a subsidiary of a public company, and were not subject to the same financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements as a public company. Since the IPO, we became required to file annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. We are required to prepare and timely file financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which impose significant compliance costs and obligations upon us. The changes necessitated by being a public company require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight which increases our operating costs. These changes also continue to place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff, which may not have prior public company experience or experience working for a newly public company, and on our financial accounting and information systems. We have hired and in the future may hire additional accounting and financial staff with public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses,\nincreased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. As a public company, we are required, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nprepare and file periodic reports, and distribute other shareholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and NYSE listing standards;\n\u2022\ndefine and expand the roles and the duties of our board of directors and its committees;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive compliance, investor relations and internal audit functions; and\n\u2022\nevaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nIn particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with an established internal control framework, and to report on our conclusions as to the effectiveness of our internal controls. In addition, we are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. As described in \u201cPart II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we identified and, as of September 30, 2017, remediated a material weakness in our internal controls. With remediation, the Company's management was able to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NYSE, or other regulatory authorities.\nIn 1992, The Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") developed an integrated framework for the design and evaluation of organization internal controls over financial reporting. Public companies have used the framework to evaluate and document the effectiveness of the internal control systems. In May of 2013, the COSO Board adopted an updated framework which will supersede the COSO 1992 framework for year ends after December 15, 2014. The revised framework is designed to address global, more complex and technology driven companies, creates greater transparency for investors and helps to meet more regulatory oversight. As a September 30th filer, we implemented the revised framework for Fiscal Year 2015.\nEven if HRG sells sufficient common stock in the future so that it is no longer our majority shareholder, anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable in the event that HRG sells sufficient stock in the future so that it is no longer our majority shareholder. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which our board of directors will be divided into three classes, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, which prevents shareholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of shareholders to remove directors;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders if HRG ceases to own at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, if HRG ceases to own at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our shareholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation if HRG ceases to own at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for shareholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nMany states, including the jurisdictions where our principal insurance subsidiaries FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are organized (Iowa and New York, respectively), have insurance laws and regulations that require advance approval by state agencies of any direct or indirect change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled in or, in some cases, has such substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled in that state. Therefore, any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and, as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nHRG directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of our common stock, so we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe utilize certain of these exemptions and intend to continue to do so. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors, and our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee do not consist entirely of independent directors, however, such board committees do perform annual performance evaluations even though they are not required to do so by NYSE listing standards.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a shareholder in our company, holders of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Principal Shareholder\u2019s interests may conflict with yours.\nHRG beneficially owns (directly or indirectly) approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, HRG is in a position to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder\napproval for the foreseeable future, including decisions regarding extraordinary business transactions, fundamental corporate transactions, appointment of members of our management, election of directors and our corporate and management policies.\nIn the event that HRG reduces its beneficial ownership below 50% of our outstanding common stock, it will likely still be able to assert significant influence over our board of directors and certain corporate actions. HRG has the ability to designate for nomination for election at least a majority of our directors as long as HRG owns at least 50% of our common stock.\nHRG\u2019s interests may differ from your interests, and certain actions HRG takes as our controlling shareholder or as a significant shareholder may not be favorable to you. For example, the concentration of ownership held by HRG could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which another shareholder may otherwise view favorably. Other potential conflicts could arise, for example, over matters such as our dividend policy or transactions that we may engage in, from time to time, with other business owned by HRG Group, such as Salus and/or FSRCI.", "PERMNO": 14337, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "FGL"}
