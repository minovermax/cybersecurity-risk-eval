Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this Annual Report which are not historical are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include: (1) statements made under Item 1, Business and Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including, without limitation, statements with respect to internal growth plans, projected revenues, margin improvement, capital expenditures and adequacy of capital resources; (2) statements included or incorporated by reference in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (3) information contained in written material, releases and oral statements issued by, or on behalf of, School Specialty including, without limitation, statements with respect to projected revenues, costs, earnings and earnings per share. Forward-looking statements also include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectation of School Specialty or its officers. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include forward-looking terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201ccontinues\u201d or similar expressions.\nAll forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of us, in this Annual Report or otherwise. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements identified above. Factors which may cause such a difference to occur include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business, could prohibit us from engaging in transactions we believe to be beneficial and could lead to the acceleration of our debt and/or an increased cost of capital.\nOur existing and future debt agreements impose and may impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios, and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\nredeem and/or prepay certain debt;\n\u2022\nsell or dispose of a minority equity interest in any subsidiary or other assets;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter new lines of business;\n\u2022\nengage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nguarantee obligations;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions.\nOur credit facilities also require us to comply with certain financial ratios, including a maximum net total leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as minimum\nliquidity levels at the end of each month. These restrictions may hamper our ability to operate our business or could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions, and other corporate opportunities. In the event that we fail to comply with the financial ratios or minimum liquidity levels contained in our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the amounts due. Also, should there be an event of default, or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of the Company\u2019s projected compliance with these debt covenants.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and as a result our investors do not have a meaningful degree of liquidity.\nSince October 2013, our common stock has been sporadically quoted on the OTCQB marketplace, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. As a consequence, there may be extended periods of time when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent. We cannot give investors any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. An investor may find it difficult or impossible to dispose of shares or obtain accurate information as to the market value of the common stock. Investors may be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2016, we had $137 million of reported total debt, or $142 million of gross debt, which excludes debt issuance costs and original issue discount. This level of debt could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022\nthe debt under our credit agreements is at a variable interest rates, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nwe will be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nwe may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage.\nWe expect to service our debt primarily from cash flow from operations. Our ability to service our debt obligations thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors. The cash flow we generate may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations. If we do not have sufficient capital, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets or borrow additional funds. We may not be able to take such actions on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these refinancing alternatives.\nOur business depends upon the growth of the student population and school expenditures and can be adversely impacted by fixed or declining school budgets.\nOur growth strategy and profitability depend in part on growth in the student population and expenditures per student in PreK-12 schools. The level of student enrollment is largely a function of demographics, while expenditures per student are affected by federal, state and local government budgets. In addition, the softening of state and local tax collections may result in reduction to school funding, and thus, school budgets. In school districts in states that primarily rely on local tax proceeds for funding, significant reductions in those proceeds for any reason can restrict district expenditures and impact our results of operations. Any significant and sustained decline in student enrollment and/or expenditures per student could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because school budgets are fixed on a yearly basis, any shift by schools in expenditures during a given fiscal year to areas that are not part of our business, such as facility operating costs and employee related expenditures, could also materially affect our business.\nA decline in school spending will impact our ability to maintain operating margins.\nUntil achieving revenue growth over the two most recent reporting periods, we had seen a decline in our operating margin, primarily as a result of our revenue declines, which we believe are primarily related to the continued school spending cuts. The Company will pursue further cost reductions if school spending declines significantly from current levels, but the Company does not intend to cut costs in areas that it believes could have a significant impact on future revenue growth. To the extent we are unable to identify additional cost reductions that can be made consistent with our strategy and the weakness in school spending persists, our operating margin may continue to decline. Additionally, spending declines can cause schools to consider purchasing lower priced products, which will lower the Company\u2019s operating margins.\nIncreasing use of web-based products is affecting our printed supplemental materials business.\nThe growth in web-based and digital-based supplements has reduced the physical paper-based supplements the Company currently markets. While we continue to enhance some of our product lines with digital alternatives, it is possible that our paper-based products could be further supplanted and/or replaced by online sources other than our own.\nIncreased costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products would adversely affect our results of operations.\nHigher than expected costs and other difficulties associated with the distribution of our products could affect our results of operations. To the extent we incur difficulties or higher-than-expected costs related to updating our distribution centers, such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any disruption in our ability to service our customers may also impact our revenues or profits. Moreover, as we update our distribution model, reduce the number of distribution centers or change the product mix of our remaining distribution centers, we may encounter unforeseen costs or difficulties that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur business is highly seasonal.\nBecause most of our customers want their school supplies delivered before or shortly after the commencement of the school year, we record most of our revenues from June to October. During this period, we receive, ship and bill the majority of orders for our products so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year. To the extent we do not sell our products to schools during the peak shipping season, many of such sales opportunities will be lost and will not be available in subsequent quarters. Our inventory levels increase in April through June in anticipation of the peak shipping season. We usually earn more than 100% of our annual net income from June to September of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss from October to May. This seasonality causes our operating results and operating cash flows to vary considerably from quarter to quarter within our fiscal years.\nIf our key suppliers or service providers were unable or unwilling to provide the products and services we require, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some of our products, especially furniture and proprietary products. We also depend upon a limited number of service providers for the delivery of our products. If these suppliers or service providers are unable or unwilling to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs (especially during our peak season of June through October), our ability to deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our agreements with our suppliers are terminable at any time or on short notice, with or without cause, and, we cannot assure that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect.\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe market for supplemental educational products and equipment is highly competitive and fragmented with many retail and wholesale companies that market supplemental educational products and equipment to schools with PreK-12 as a primary focus of their business. We also face competition from alternate channel marketers, including office supply superstores, office product contract stationers, and purchasing cooperatives that have not traditionally focused on marketing supplemental educational products and equipment. Our competitors impact the prices we are able to charge and we expect to continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors in the future, especially on our commodity-type products. These competitors are likely to continue to expand their product lines and interest in supplemental educational products and equipment. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources and buying power than we do. We believe that the supplemental educational products and equipment market will consolidate over the next several years, which could increase competition in both our markets. We also face increased competition and pricing pressure as a result of the accessibility of the internet.\nIf any of our key personnel discontinue their role with us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends to a large extent on the abilities and continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees, our business could be adversely affected. We do not intend to maintain key man life insurance covering any of our executive officers or other members of our management.\nA failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our operations and growth opportunities.\nOur ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and we may not be successful in implementing our strategy. This includes limitations due to the inability to obtain financing and/or the restrictiveness of our debt covenants. In addition, the implementation of our strategy may not lead to improved operating results. We may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies due to business or competitive factors or factors not currently expected, such as unforeseen costs and expenses or events beyond our control. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and growth opportunities.\nWe face risks associated with our increasing emphasis on imported goods and private label products.\nIncreases in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods may adversely impact our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows. Our business strategy includes an increased emphasis on offering private label products and sourcing quality merchandise directly from low-cost suppliers. As a result, we expect to rely more heavily on imported goods from China and other countries and we expect the sale of\nimported goods to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues. To the extent we rely more heavily on the sale of private label products, our potential exposure to product liability claims may increase. In addition, our reputation may become more closely tied to our private label products and may suffer to the extent our customers are not satisfied with the quality of such products. Private label products will also increase our risks associated with returns and inventory obsolescence. Our reliance on imported merchandise subjects us to a number of risks, including: (a) increased difficulties in ensuring quality control; (b) disruptions in the flow of imported goods due to factors such as raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes, and political unrest in foreign countries; (c) problems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages; (d) economic crises and international disputes; (e) increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from a failure of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with China and the other countries we do business in; (f) import duties, import quotas, and other trade sanctions; and (g) increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific shipping cartel. If imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, we may not be able to transition to alternative sources in time to meet our customers\u2019 demands. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods due to these or other factors would significantly decrease our revenues and profits and have an adverse impact on our cash flows.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to defend against third party claims of intellectual property infringement, which in each case could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or conduct our business as presently conducted.\nFrom time to time we are involved in litigation because others allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and may divert management\u2019s time and attention. Any intellectual property litigation alleging our infringement of a third-party\u2019s intellectual property also could force us or our customers to i) stop producing or using products that use the challenged intellectual property, ii) obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property, at our expense, a license to sell or use the relevant technology at an additional cost, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all iii) redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology, or iv) change the ways in which we conduct our business so as to avoid infringing the technology. Any costs we incur from having to take any of these actions could be material.\nCurrency exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nTo the extent we source merchandise from overseas manufacturers and sell products internationally, exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to service our U.S. dollar-denominated debt. All of our debt is in U.S. dollars while a portion of our revenue is derived from imported products and international sales. Therefore, fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar could impact our costs and revenues. In addition, for the purposes of financial reporting, any change in the value of the foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain. Consequently, our reported earnings could fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange translation and may not be comparable from period to period.\nIt is difficult to forecast our revenue stream given the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers and\ndelays in passage of state budgets.\nThe seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers, the fact that our customers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis, and the lack of visibility into education funding levels if state budgets are delayed make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue stream, which may vary significantly from period to period. Third parties that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties. The difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue increases the likelihood that our financial results will differ materially from any projected financial results. Any shortfall in our financial results from our, or third-party, projected results could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may have a material amount of intangible assets which are potentially subject to impairment.\nAt December 31, 2016, intangible assets represented approximately 20% of our total assets. We are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and other intangibles if indicators of impairment exist. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.7 million in fiscal 2015 related to definite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated based on a fair value assessment of these assets. The fair value assessments of these assets are based on significant assumptions, including earnings projections and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value assessment and the resulting conclusion as to any potential asset impairment and the amount of any such impairment.\nWe have a material amount of capitalized product development costs which might be written-down.\nWe had capitalized product development costs of $12.2 million, $17.1 million, and $19.6 million at December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and April 25, 2015, respectively, related to internally developed products, which are amortized to expense over the lesser of five years or the product\u2019s life cycle. Any changes in the estimated sales volume or life cycle of the underlying products could cause the currently capitalized costs or costs capitalized in the future to be impaired. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we recorded write-downs of capitalized product development costs of $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nOur operations are dependent on our information systems.\nWe have integrated the operations of our divisions and subsidiaries on a single ERP, which operates on a system located at our third-party hosted ERP system provider\u2019s facilities. The system relies on continuous telecommunication connections to the main computers. If any of these connections becomes disrupted, or unavailable, for an extended period of time, the disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nIncreased cyber-security requirements and potential threats could pose a risk to our systems, networks, services and data. Even though we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from unexpected events that could interrupt new and existing business operations and systems, we cannot be sure that fire, flood or other natural disasters would not disable our systems and/or prevent them from communicating between business segments. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on our intellectual property in the design and marketing of our products.\nWe rely on certain trademarks, trade names and service names, along with licenses to use and exploit certain intellectual property related to designs of proprietary products, trademarks, trade names and service names (collectively, the \u201cmarks\u201d) in the design and marketing of some of our products. We could lose our ability to use our brands if our marks were found to be generic or descriptive, as well as the right to sell proprietary products which are based upon licensed intellectual property. While no single mark is material to our business, the termination of a number of these marks could have an adverse effect on our business. The loss of certain licensed intellectual property related to proprietary products (for example, FOSS\u00ae) may have a material adverse effect on our business. We also rely on certain copyrights, patents and licenses other than those described above, the termination or loss of which could have an adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 86189, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "SCOO"}
