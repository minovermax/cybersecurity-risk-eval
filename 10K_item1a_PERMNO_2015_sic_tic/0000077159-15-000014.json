{"cik": "77159", "company": "PENN VIRGINIA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCrude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in prices would hurt our profitability and financial condition.\nOur revenues, operating results, cash flows, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on prevailing market prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Historically, crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. In particular, average monthly WTI crude oil prices have decreased from over $105 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $45 per barrel in January 2015. Decreases in commodity prices have led us to curtail drilling and other exploration activities in 2015. Even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth. Wide fluctuations in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market demand and other factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign consumer demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil or gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting nations to agree upon and maintain production constraints and oil price controls;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and foreign economic conditions;\n\u2022\nprices and availability of, and demand for, alternative fuels;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nspeculation by investors in oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing, refining and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation.\nIt is impossible to predict future oil and gas price movements with certainty. However, many of our projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. These price assumptions are used for planning purposes. We expect our assumptions will change over time and that actual prices in the future will likely differ\nfrom our estimates. Any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of crude oil, NGLs or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and borrowing capacity, the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we can economically produce, the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties and our ability to fund our capital program. In addition, if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock\nOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nUnless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operating activities. We have historically succeeded in substantially replacing reserves primarily through exploration and development and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. We have conducted such activities on our existing oil and gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties. We may not be able to continue to replace reserves and production from such activities at acceptable costs. Lower prices also decrease our cash flows from operating activities and may cause us to reduce capital expenditures.\nThe business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flows from operating activities are reduced and external sources of capital are limited. In addition, exploration and development activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes, the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.\nWe are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities. Competition for oil and gas properties can be intense, however, and many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us. In the event we are successful in completing an acquisition, we cannot ensure that such acquisition will consist of properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that such acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations.\nWe may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures to find, acquire, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. In 2015, we anticipate making capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $345 million compared to $794 million in 2014.\nIf crude oil or NGL prices continue to decrease, natural gas prices fail to recover or we encounter operating difficulties that result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected, we may have to further reduce our capital expenditures unless we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement, or the Revolver, or we obtain alternative financing.\nFuture cash flows and the availability of financing will also be subject to a number of variables, such as our success in locating and producing new reserves, the level of production from existing wells and prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nIf our revenues were to decrease due to lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, decreased production or other reasons, and if we could not obtain capital through the Revolver, or otherwise on acceptable terms, our ability to execute our development plans, replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and our ability to service our indebtedness depends on certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of debt outstanding and would have been able to incur an additional $413.2 million (net of $1.8 million of letters of credit) under the Revolver. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Any increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nwe will have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; and\n\u2022\ndepending on the levels of our outstanding debt, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes may be limited.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable\nto generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities in the future to service our debt, we may be forced, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nseek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022\nrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell selected assets;\n\u2022\nreduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or\n\u2022\nreduce or delay planned operating expenditures.\nSuch measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all.\nThe borrowing base under the Revolver may be reduced in the future if commodity prices remain below recent historical averages.\nThe borrowing base under the Revolver was $500 million as of December 31, 2014. Our borrowing base is redetermined twice each year and is scheduled to be redetermined during May 2015. If crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices decline or fail to recover to prior levels, the borrowing base under the Revolver may be reduced. As a result, we may be unable to obtain funding under the Revolver. If funding is not available when or in the amounts needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, it might adversely affect our development plan as currently anticipated and our ability to make new acquisitions, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Revolver and our other debt instruments have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility and our ability to borrow.\nThe Revolver and the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nOur ability to borrow under the Revolver is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, including leverage and current ratios. Under our current 2015 business plan, we are projected to be operating near the limits of the leverage permitted by the Revolver. If at any time we anticipate that we may exceed such limits, we would be forced to seek a means to cure the potential breach such as requesting a Revolver amendment to increase the permitted leverage, decreasing the pace or magnitude of our capital program or considering a capital markets transaction. There can be no assurance that any of these potential solutions would be successful and, if we were to exceed our leverage limits, we would be in breach of the Revolver.\nThe Revolver includes other restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations; make asset dispositions, restricted payments and investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. The indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events, as well as other limitations, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the declaration and payment of dividends or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on incurring additional indebtedness or issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the creation or existence of certain liens;\n\u2022\nlimitations on incurring restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the sale of assets.\nOur business plan and our compliance with these covenants are based on a number of assumptions, the most important of which is relatively stable oil and gas prices at economically sustainable levels. If the price that we receive for our oil and gas production deteriorates significantly from current levels it could lead to lower revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default under certain financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility. Because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period as the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility are dependent on the timing of cash flows related to operations, capital expenditures, sales of oil and gas properties and securities offerings. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts. We do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness.\nExploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nOil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reserves will be found. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\nelevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\ncosts, shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, crews, equipment and materials;\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor;\n\u2022\nsurface access restrictions;\n\u2022\nfailure to or delays in securing necessary regulatory approvals and permits, including delays due to potential hydraulic fracturing regulations;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blow-outs and surface cratering; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nThe prevailing prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. The availability of drilling rigs and equipment can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand, an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region.\nThe wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or gas is present or may be produced economically. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. In addition, limitations on the use of hydraulic fracturing could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce oil and gas from new wells, which would reduce our rate of return on these wells and our cash flows. Drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful, nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular area will not decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify. Although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations, we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and nonpayment or nonperformance by these parties would reduce our cash flows.\nWe are subject to risk from loss resulting from our customers\u2019 nonperformance or nonpayment. We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. In 2014, approximately 50 percent of our total consolidated product revenues resulted from three of our customers. Any nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers would reduce our cash flows.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties and these third parties may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one party. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the other working interest owners. In addition, the possibility of an economic downturn and the volatility in commodity prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established than we, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. Some of our project partners have experienced liquidity and cash flow problems. These problems may lead our partners to attempt to delay the pace of drilling or project development in order to preserve cash. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs. In some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.\nOur business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on gathering, processing, refining and transportation facilities owned by others.\nWe deliver substantially all of our oil and gas production through pipelines and trucks that we do not own. The marketability of our production depends upon the availability, proximity and capacity of these pipelines and trucks, as well as gathering systems, gas processing facilities and downstream refineries. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells, the reduction in wellhead pricing or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Federal, state and local regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather, process, refine and market our oil and gas.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to conduct the drilling and completion operations on properties we operate.\nWhere we are the operator of a property, we rely on third-party service providers to perform necessary drilling and completion operations. The ability of third-party service providers to perform such drilling and completion operations will depend on those service providers\u2019 ability to compete for and retain qualified personnel, financial condition, economic performance, and access to capital, which in turn will depend upon the supply and demand for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors. The failure of a third-party service provider to adequately perform operations could delay drilling or completion, reduce production from the property or cause other damage to operations, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change.\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows are not precise.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. These estimates are dependent on many variables and, therefore, changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nActual future production, crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 60 percent of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped. Estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Production revenues from proved developed non-producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, these estimated costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated.\nThe reserve estimation standards provide that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. These standards may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not develop those reserves within the required five-year time frame or cannot demonstrate that we could do so. We removed approximately 20.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves in 2014 as a result of the five-year limitation.\nYou should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flows (standardized measure) referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the\nestimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. As a result, net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the SEC estimate that is provided herein. Actual future net cash flows may also be affected by the amount and timing of actual production, supply and demand for oil and gas, increases or decreases in consumption of oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us.\nWe may record impairment losses on our oil and gas properties.\nQuantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence in the period of assessment. Lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives on certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, thus reducing proved property reserve estimates. If such revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves occur, it will have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD&A, on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher DD&A expense. The revisions may also be sufficient enough to cause impairment losses on certain properties that would result in a further non-cash charge to reported earnings.\nGAAP requires that the carrying value of oil and gas properties be reviewed on a periodic basis for possible impairment. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value of oil and gas properties is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to the property. In addition to revisions to reserves and the impact of lower commodity prices, impairments may occur due to increases in estimated operating and development costs and other factors. During the past several years, we have been required to impair certain of our oil and gas properties and related assets. If crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices decline or we drill uneconomic wells, it is reasonably possible that we will have to record a significant impairment in the future. While an impairment charge reflects our ability to recover the carrying value of our investments, it does not impact our cash flows from operating activities.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nIn 2014, other companies operated approximately 10 percent of our net production. Our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including timing and amount of capital expenditures, the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants in drilling wells, selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs.\nOur property acquisitions carry significant risks.\nAcquisition of oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production. Competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense. In the event we do complete an acquisition, its success will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the purchase price, future crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves, future operating and capital costs, results of future exploration, exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. A customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited.\nIntegrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks. These risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results, and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nWe are a relatively small company and therefore may not be able to compete effectively.\nCompared to many of our competitors in the oil and gas industry, we are a small company. We face difficulties in competing with larger companies. The costs of doing business in the exploration and production industry, including such costs\nas those required to explore new oil and natural gas plays, to acquire new acreage, and to develop attractive oil and natural gas projects, are significant. We face intense competition in all areas of our business from companies with greater and more productive assets, substantially larger staffs and greater financial and operating resources than we have. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to funding our operating costs, and means that we are more vulnerable to commodity price volatility and overall industry cycles, are less able to absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations, and that poor results in any single exploration, development or production play can have a disproportionately negative impact on us.\nWe also compete for people, including experienced geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to attracting and retaining management and other professionals with the technical abilities necessary to successfully operate our business.\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major contiguous area.\nOur current business is focused primarily in the Eagle Ford in South Texas. Due to the concentrated nature of our business activities, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of crude oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex environmental laws. Future laws or regulations, any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, environmental protection and taxation. Our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water. In the event of environmental violations, we may be charged with remedial costs and land owners may file claims for alternative water supplies, property damage or bodily injury. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may, in some circumstances, result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault. In addition, pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nOur business involves many operating risks, including hydraulic fracturing, that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation, development and exploration for and the production and transportation of oil and gas, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing. These operating risks include:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering and casing collapses;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nmigration of fracturing fluids into surrounding groundwater;\n\u2022\nspills or releases of fracturing fluids including from trucks sometimes used to deliver these materials;\n\u2022\nspills or releases of brine or other produced water that may go off-site;\n\u2022\nsubsurface conditions that prevent us from (i) stimulating the planned number of stages, (ii) accessing the entirety of the wellbore with our tools during completion or (iii) removing all fracturing materials from the wellbore to allow production to begin;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and other adverse weather conditions, terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches.\nAny of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damages, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own, lease or operate. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses.\nIf we experience any problems with well stimulation and completion activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, our ability to explore for and produce oil or natural gas may be adversely affected. We could incur substantial losses or otherwise fail to realize reserves in particular formations as a result of:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other governmental or regulatory requirements, which may include limitations on hydraulic fracturing or the discharge of GHGs; and\n\u2022\nthe need to shut down, abandon and relocate drilling operations;\n\u2022\nthe need to sample, test and monitor drinking water in particular areas and to provide filtration or other drinking water supplies to users of water supplies that may have been impacted or threatened by potential contamination from fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nthe need to modify drill sites to ensure there are no spills or releases off-site and to investigate and/or remediate any spills or releases that might have occurred; or\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance at a level that balances the cost of insurance with our assessment of the risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities or that we will purchase insurance against all possible losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured or indemnified against, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAccess to water to conduct hydraulic fracturing may not be available if water sources become scarce.\nThe availability of water is crucial to conduct hydraulic fracturing. Approximately 80,000-100,000 gallons of water are necessary for drilling and completing one well with hydraulic fracturing in Texas. In recent years, Texas has experienced severe droughts that have limited the water supplies that are necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing. Although we have taken measures to secure our water supply, we can make no assurances that sufficient water resources will be available in the short or long term to carry out our current activities.\nLaws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, EPA implemented rules requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States for emissions occurring after January 1, 2010. In a December 2014 proposed rule, the EPA proposed to add GHG reporting requirements applicable to petroleum and natural gas systems, including various equipment and systems associated with hydraulic fracturing operations. Moreover, the Obama administration has announced in its Climate Action Plan that it intends to adopt additional regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs in the coming years, likely including further restrictions on emissions of methane from oil and gas operations. More specifically, it has been reported that the EPA will issue a proposed rule in the summer of 2015 that would cut methane emissions from oil and gas production by up to 45 percent by 2025 from the levels recorded in 2012. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.\nIn addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into prospective rock formations to stimulate oil and gas production. We use this completion technique on all of our wells. The EPA is studying the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and its potential impact on drinking water resources. A draft of the study was expected to be released to the public in 2014, but has yet to be issued. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the collection of information on various chemicals and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA is also developing a proposed rule to amend the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the oil and gas industry. The proposal is expected to address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. The proposed rule is scheduled for publication in early 2015. The EPA has issued final rules under the CAA that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAP\u201d) programs. In light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, some states and local governments have enacted legislation or adopted regulations, and the U.S. Congress and other states are considering enacting legislation or adopting regulations, that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, monitoring, well construction and water use requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Individually or collectively, such new legislation or regulation could result in increased compliance and operating costs, delays or additional operating restrictions. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. While we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations, these requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations, any of which could be significant.\nIf the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife or their habitat may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nVarious federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that harm endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act, CERCLA and the OPA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling, construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, may seek criminal penalties.\nDerivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the sale of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, we periodically enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedges are limited in duration, usually for periods of two years or less. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements. In trying to maintain an appropriate balance, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future.\nIn addition, derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or\n\u2022\na sudden, unexpected event materially impacts crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices.\nIn addition, derivative instruments involve basis risk. Basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. For example, a NYMEX index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur ability to utilize U.S. net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to various limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The utilization of such carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain ownership changes, including the purchase or sale of our stock by 5% shareholders and our offering of stock during any three-year period resulting in an aggregate change of more than 50% in our beneficial ownership. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that can be offset by these carryforwards. As of December 31, 2014, we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred; however, to the extent an ownership change has occurred or were to occur in the future, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses could cause a significant net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation.\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2015 recommended the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, the elimination of the deduction for United States production activities for oil and gas production, and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, other oil and gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA cyber incident could result in theft of confidential information, data corruption or operational disruption.\nThe oil and gas industry is dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. Software programs are used for, among other things, reserve estimates, seismic interpretation, modeling and compliance reporting. In addition, the use of mobile communication is widespread. Increasingly, we must protect our business against potential cyber incidents including attacks.\nIf our systems for protecting against cyber incidents prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by unauthorized access to our digital systems which could result in theft of confidential information, data corruption or operational disruption. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective systems or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 61955, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PVAC"}
