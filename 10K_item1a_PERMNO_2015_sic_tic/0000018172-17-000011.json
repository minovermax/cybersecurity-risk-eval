{"cik": "18172", "company": "CASTLE A M & CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments.\nWe have substantial debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $298.9 million of total debt outstanding, excluding capital lease obligations of $0.1 million, all of which is secured. The debt outstanding, in order of priority, was comprised of $99.5 million of borrowings against our new 11.0% secured credit facilities due 2018 (the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d), $177.0 million aggregate principal amount of 12.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the \"New Secured Notes\"), $22.3 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2019 (the \"New Convertible Notes\"), and approximately $0.1 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Convertible Notes due 2017 (the \"Convertible Notes\"). In December 2016, we entered into the Credit Facilities with certain financial institutions in order to replace and repay outstanding borrowings and support the continuance of letters of credit under our former senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Credit Facilities are in the form of senior secured first lien term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $112.0 million. The Credit Facilities consist of a $75.0 million initial term loan facility funded at closing and a $37.0 million delayed-draw term loan facility (the \u201cDelayed Draw Facility\u201d). Under the Delayed Draw Facility, $24.5 million was available in December 2016 and $12.5 million is expected to become available in June 2017 or thereafter. In December 2016, we borrowed the $24.5 million of the Delayed Draw Facility available in accordance with its terms.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to use for operations and other purposes, including potentially accretive acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund a change of control offer under our debt instruments may be limited;\n\u2022\nour substantial level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022\nour substantial level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to satisfy our debt obligations from our operations and available resources under the Credit Facilities. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these principal and interest payments as they come due, therefore, depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, and our anticipated revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our existing debt service obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur total outstanding debt under our New Secured Notes, New Convertible Notes, Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities has an aggregate principal amount of $298.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Through September 2018, when our Credit Facilities borrowings presently become due, our debt service obligations on such debt will be primarily limited to interest payments. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we may not be able to maintain or realize a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability under our Credit Facilities. We currently plan that we will have sufficient cash flows from our operations to continue as a going concern, however, these plans rely on certain underlying assumptions and estimates that may differ from actual results. Such assumptions include improvements in operating results and cash flows driven by the restructuring activities we completed in 2015 and 2016, which streamlined our organizational structure, lowered operating costs and increased liquidity. Continued losses from operations and insufficient cash flow from operations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments, capital expenditures or potentially accretive acquisitions, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or the terms thereof. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nOur debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur debt agreements impose, and future debt agreements may impose, operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness unless certain financial tests are satisfied, or issue disqualified capital stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nissue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ngrant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nincur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or acquire assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nchange the business we conduct.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, in certain circumstances, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nOur future operating results are impacted by the volatility of the prices of metals, which could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nThe prices we pay for metal raw materials and the prices we charge for products may fluctuate depending on many factors, including general economic conditions (both domestic and international), competition, production levels, import duties and other trade restrictions and currency fluctuations. To the extent metal prices decline, we would generally expect lower sales, pricing and possibly lower operating income. Depending on the timing of the price changes and to the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our metal raw materials prices, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short lead-times and the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or, in some cases, losses, either of which could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain provisions of our debt instruments, as well as result in us incurring impairment charges.\nWe may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring and performance enhancement initiatives.\nIn April 2015, we announced an operational restructuring plan that was completed in May 2016. The organizational changes completed as part of this most recent restructuring plan included workforce reductions and the consolidations of facilities in locations deemed to have redundant operations. The consolidations and organizational changes were part of our plan to streamline the organizational structure, lower structural operating costs, and increase liquidity. With regards to our most recent restructuring plan, as well as previous restructuring plans completed in 2013 and 2014, we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated impact of these restructuring and performance enhancement initiatives. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these initiatives is subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Some of our cost saving measures may not have the impact on our operating profitability that we currently project. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these initiatives or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are continuing to evaluate various additional restructuring and strategic alternatives designed to further reduce long-term debt and cash interest obligations, the timing and outcome of which are highly uncertain and could be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding equity securities and adversely affect the trading prices and values of our current debt and equity securities.\nWe believe that reduction in our long-term debt and cash interest obligations would strengthen our financial position and flexibility and therefore remains a key near-term financial objective. Accordingly, we expect to continue to explore, evaluate and implement various restructuring and strategic alternatives, whether through seeking additional capital, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, debt repurchases, exchanges of existing debt securities for new debt securities and exchanges or conversions of existing debt securities for new equity securities, or other options. The timing and outcome of these efforts currently is highly uncertain. One or more of these alternatives could potentially be consummated without the consent of any one or more of our current security holders and, if consummated, could be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding equity securities and adversely affect the trading prices and values of our current debt and equity securities.\nOur common stock was delisted in early 2017 by the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") for failing to satisfy the NYSE continued listing standards, and our common stock is now traded on the OTCQB\u00ae Venture Market (the \"OTCQB\"), which could have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and could involve additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nOn December 6, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE as a result of our failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15 million for our common stock. The NYSE also suspended the trading of our common stock at the close of trading on December 6, 2016. On January 4, 2017, the NYSE filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the Company from the NYSE. Such delisting became effective on January 17, 2017.\nWhile we had the ability to appeal the decision by the NYSE, our Board of Directors determined that it was in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders to begin trading on the over-the-counter (the \"OTC\") market following the suspension of trading of our common stock. On December 7, 2016, our common stock immediately began trading on the OTCQB, which is operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol \u201cCASL\u201d.\nThe trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than NYSE may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our shareholders. Securities traded in the OTC market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, or parties with whom we have business relationships.\nBecause our common stock trades on the OTC market, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.\nHolders of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the \"New Convertible Notes\") can require us to repurchase their New Convertible Notes following a fundamental change, which includes, among other things, the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding voting power by a person or group. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $22.3 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the New Convertible Notes. The New Convertible Notes bear cash interest semiannually at a rate of 5.25% per year, and mature on December 30, 2019. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the New Convertible Notes), which includes the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding voting power by a person or group, we may be required to repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the relevant fundamental change repurchase date. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and, in such circumstances, may not be able to arrange the necessary financing on favorable\nterms or at all. In addition, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations will be restricted pursuant to covenants contained in the indenture for the New Convertible Notes and will be permitted to be paid only in limited circumstances. We may also be limited in our ability to satisfy such cash obligations by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness. Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of default under the New Convertible Notes, which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness, thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness, the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.\nThe exercise of our outstanding warrants for common stock and the conversion of our New Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\nAny issuance by us of our common stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants or conversion of our New Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. In addition, any such issuance of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the average stock price during the period is greater than the conversion prices and exercise prices of the New Convertible Notes and warrants, respectively. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical, and any downturn in our customers\u2019 industries could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nMany of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand, availability of adequate credit and financing, customer inventory levels, changes in governmental policies and other factors beyond our control. As a result of this volatility in the industries we serve, when one or more of our customers' industries experiences a decline, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries. Historically, we have made a strategic decision to focus sales resources on certain industries, specifically the aerospace, oil and gas, heavy equipment, machine tools and general industrial equipment industries. A downturn in these industries has had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results. We are also particularly sensitive to market trends in the manufacturing sectors of the North American economy. In 2015, the downturn in the oil and gas sector had a significant impact on our financial results as sales to customers which operate in that market were significantly lower than they had been previously. In February 2016, we announced the sale of all inventory from our Houston and Edmonton facilities that primarily serviced the oil and gas sector. With this sale and the subsequent closure of the Houston and Edmonton facilities, we significantly lowered our exposure to oil-related market fluctuations. Going forward, we will be primarily focused on two key industries, aerospace and industrial.\nA portion of our sales, particularly in the aerospace industry, are related to contracts awarded to our customers under various U.S. Government defense-related programs. Significant changes in defense spending, or in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of those defense programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. The level of U.S. spending for defense, alternative energy and other programs to which such funding is allocated, is subject to periodic congressional appropriation actions, including the sequestration of appropriations in fiscal years 2013 and after, under the Budget Control Act of 2011, and is subject to change at any time.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may force us to lower our prices and may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability and timely delivery. We compete in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which have greater financial resources than we do and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve. We also compete to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to very large customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer increased services at a higher cost to us, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to the seasonal nature of our customers\u2019 businesses.\nA portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Historically, our revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or\nvacation closures for some customers. Dependent on market and economic conditions, our sales in the first two quarters of the year, therefore, can be higher than in the third and fourth quarters due to this seasonality. As a result, analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our operating results in one or more future quarters and, consequently, our operating results may fall below expectations.\nAn additional impairment or restructuring charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating performance. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension benefits, and pension curtailments, which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs, making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance. The results of these calculations may be affected by the current demand and any decline in market conditions for our products, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. If impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses since 2008. We may not generate future taxable income so that we can use our available net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, as an offset. As of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. federal NOLs of $197.9 million. The $197.9 million in U.S. federal NOLs will expire in various years beginning with 2032. We have determined that an ownership shift of greater than fifty percent occurred in 2015. As such, it is expected that a portion of the pre- ownership shift NOLs will be subject to a Section 382 limitation that will act to prevent the Company from utilizing all of its losses against future taxable income. We experienced another ownership change in 2016, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs. As of December 31, 2016, we have a full valuation allowance against our federal and state NOLs.\nDisruptions or shortages in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business requires materials that are sourced from third party suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of raw materials to us at competitive prices and in a timely manner, our operating results could suffer. Unforeseen disruptions in our supply bases could materially impact our ability to deliver products to customers. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting metals producers, or suppliers may be unwilling or unable to meet our demand due to industry supply conditions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such raw materials from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. To the extent we have quoted prices to customers and accepted orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers.\nIn some cases the availability of raw materials requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely supply customers with sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreases in freight and energy prices would increase our operating costs and we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe use energy to process and transport our products. The prices for and availability of energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions, which are affected by political, economic and regulatory factors beyond our control. Our operating costs increase if energy costs, including electricity, diesel fuel and natural gas, rise. During periods of higher freight and energy costs, we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. In addition, we typically do not hedge our exposure to higher freight or energy prices.\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to a number of risks.\nAlthough a majority of our business activity takes place in the United States, we serve and operate in certain international markets, which exposes us to political, economic and currency related risks, including the following:\n\u2022\npotential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty staffing and managing geographically diverse operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate risk; and\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and taxes.\nIn addition to the United States, we operate in Canada, Mexico, France, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and China. An act of war or terrorism or major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules, cause additional delays in importing or exporting products into or out of any of these countries, including the United States, or increase the costs required to do so. In addition, acts of crime or violence in these international markets could adversely affect our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could reduce our stockholders' equity. If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty arising from the outcome of the recent referendum on the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), which triggered short-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the British pound in comparison to both the U.S. dollar and the euro. Before the United Kingdom leaves the EU, a process of negotiation is required to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the EU. The uncertainty before, during and after the period of negotiation could have a negative economic impact and result in further volatility in the markets for several years. Such ongoing uncertainty may result in various economic and financial consequences for businesses operating in the United Kingdom, the EU and beyond.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations in the United Kingdom, and approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations in Europe overall. The Company and its various subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities denominated in British pounds, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, and the future impacts of the United Kingdom's exit from the EU could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nA portion of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining units, which may lead to work stoppages.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 20% of our U.S. employees were represented by the United Steelworkers of America (\"USW\") under collective bargaining agreements, including hourly warehouse employees at our distribution centers in Cleveland, Ohio and Hammond, Indiana. As these agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to replace those that expire. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory, we cannot predict how stable our relationships with the USW will be or whether we will be able to meet the USW requirements without impacting our operating results and financial condition. The USW may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages and instability in our relationship with the USW could negatively impact the timely processing and shipment of our products, which could strain relationships with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our operating results. On October 1, 2014, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 101 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. This agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2018, and our goal is to engage in early negotiations in the spring of 2018 to secure another four-year agreement and avoid disruption to the business. Approximately 22 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated in August 2016 and expires in August 2020.\nWe rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them.\nWe rely on mill or supplier certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metals received from our suppliers for resale and generally, consistent with industry practice, do not undertake independent testing of such metals. We rely on our customers to notify us of any product that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplier or ordered by the customer. Although our primary sources of products have been domestic suppliers,\nwe have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate. In the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill or supplier certifications or customer specifications, we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers. However, such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub-standard products and possible losses of customers. Moreover, there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill or supplier certifications. In such circumstances, we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry, or do not carry sufficient, insurance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a disruption to our primary distribution hubs.\nOur largest facilities, in Cleveland, Ohio, and Hammond, Indiana, as well as our facility in Janesville, Wisconsin, serve as primary distribution centers that ship product to our other facilities as well as external customers. Our business could be adversely impacted by a major disruption at any of these facilities due to unforeseen developments occurring in or around the facility, such as:\n\u2022\ndamage to or inoperability of our warehouse or related systems;\n\u2022\na prolonged power or telecommunication failure;\n\u2022\na natural disaster, environmental or public health issue, or an act of war or terrorism on-site.\nA prolonged disruption of the services and capabilities of these or other of our facilities could adversely impact our operating results.\nDamage to or a disruption in our information technology systems could impact our ability to conduct business and could subject us to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws.\nDifficulties associated with the design and implementation of our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") or other information technology systems could adversely affect our business, our customer service and our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on one information technology system to provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel, improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results. Difficulties associated with upgrades or integration with new systems could lead to business interruption that could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs and decrease profitability. In addition, any significant disruption relating to our current information technology systems, whether resulting from such things as fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, power loss, network failures, loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses, or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our business, our operating results and our ability to report our financial performance in a timely manner.\nThe success of our business depends on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party vendors. In connection with conducting our business in the ordinary course, we store and transmit limited amounts of customer, vendor, and employee information, including account or credit card information, and other personally identifiable information. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or use of, our networks, computer systems or services, whether intentional, unintentional or as a result of criminal activity, could potentially jeopardize the security of this confidential information. A number of other companies have publicly disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their networks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose employees, customers, or vendors. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers, vendors, or employees, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or vendors which could expose us to claims from such persons or from regulators, financial institutions or others with whom we do business, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach related to us or the parties with which we have commercial relationships, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation, and possible liability. We cannot give assurance that the security measures we take will be effective in preventing these types of activities. We also cannot give assurance that the security measures of our third-party vendors, including network providers, providers of customer and vendor support services, and other vendors, will be adequate. In addition to potential legal liability,\nthese activities may adversely impact our reputation or our revenues and may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which could adversely impact our business.\nOwnership of our stock is concentrated, which may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nFrom time to time, the Company has experienced concentrations of ownership among institutional investors and/or hedge funds. As of December 31, 2016, based on filings made with the SEC and other information made available to us as of that date, we believe one of our directors, Jonathan B. Mellin, through his affiliation with W. B. & Co., may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 35% of our common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Mellin and his affiliates, and/or any other concentrated ownership interests may have the voting power to substantially affect or control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters. Such a concentration of control could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent a change in control or other business combinations that might be beneficial to us.\nWe could be vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness, which could hurt our operating results.\nWe are exposed to various interest rate risks that arise in the normal course of business. Market risk arises from changes in interest rates. We currently finance our operations with fixed rate borrowings, and the market value of our $298.9 million of fixed rate borrowings may be impacted by changes in interest rates. Historically, we have financed our operations with variable rate borrowings in addition to fixed rate borrowings. If, in the future, we use variable rate borrowings to finance our operations, and interest rates subsequently increase significantly, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nCommodity hedging transactions may expose us to loss or limit our potential gains.\nWe have entered into certain fixed price sales contracts with customers which expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. As part of our risk management program, we may use financial instruments from time-to-time to mitigate all or portions of these risks, including commodity futures, forwards or other derivative instruments. While intended to reduce the effects of the commodity price fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. Also, should our counterparties to such transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.\nWe may face risks associated with current or future litigation and claims.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. These suits concern issues including contract disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, personal injury and product liability matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending lawsuits and claims, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one of more of these matters could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\nWe could incur substantial costs in order to comply with, or to address any violations under, environmental and employee health and safety laws, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including laws and regulations governing materials we use and our facilities. In addition, certain of our operations are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations, including those concerning occupational injury and illness, employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Currently unknown cleanup obligations at these facilities, or at off-site locations at which materials from our operations were disposed, could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified, but which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\nPotential environmental legislative and regulatory actions could impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nClimate change regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (''GHG'') emissions is currently being considered in the United States as well as elsewhere globally. As a metals distributor, our operations do not emit significant amounts of GHG. However, the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations may impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers and indirectly impact our operations.\nUntil the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have various mechanisms in place that may prevent a change in control that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nIn August 2013, we elected by resolution of the Board of Directors to become subject to Section 3-803 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \"MGCL\"). As a result of this election, the Board of Directors was classified into three separate classes of directors, with each class generally serving three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. The provision for a classified board could prevent a party who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock from obtaining control of our Board of Directors until the second annual stockholders meeting following the date the acquiring party obtains the controlling interest. The classified board provision could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and could increase the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions.\nIn addition, our charter and by-laws and the MGCL include provisions that may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. For example, the MGCL, our charter and bylaws require the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter to amend our charter (unless our Board of Directors has unanimously approved the amendment, in which case the approval of the holders of a majority of such votes is required), contain certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to our Board of Directors, and permit our Board of Directors to issue up to 9.988 million shares of preferred stock.\nFurthermore, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the MGCL that prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the business combination or stockholder interest is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of these and certain other provisions of our charter or the MGCL could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe provisions of our debt instruments also contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. In addition, the repurchase rights in our New Convertible Notes triggered by the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the New Convertible Notes), and the additional shares of our common stock by which the conversion rate is increased in connection with certain fundamental change transactions, as described in the indenture for the New Convertible Notes, could discourage a potential acquirer.", "PERMNO": 30402, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "CTAM"}
