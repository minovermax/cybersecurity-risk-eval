RISK FACTORS.\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nThe chemicals industry is cyclical, seasonal and volatile, experiencing alternating periods of tight supply and overcapacity, and the building products industry is also cyclical and seasonal. This cyclicality adversely impacts our capacity utilization and causes fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe historical operating results for our chlorovinyls and aromatics chemical businesses have tended to reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the chemicals industry. Historically, periods of tight supply have resulted in increased prices and profit margins and have been followed by periods of substantial capacity increase, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins for those products. A number of the products of our chlorovinyls and aromatics segments are highly dependent on markets that are particularly cyclical, such as the building and construction, paper and pulp and automotive markets. As a result of changes in demand for our products, our operating rates and earnings fluctuate significantly, not only from year to year, but also from quarter to quarter, depending on factors such as feedstock costs, transportation costs and supply and demand for the product produced at the facility during that period. In order to compensate for changes in demand, we have historically operated individual facilities below or above rated capacities in any period, and we expect to continue this practice in the future. We may idle a facility for an extended period of time because an oversupply of a certain product or a lack of demand for that product makes production uneconomical. Facility shutdown and subsequent restart expenses may adversely affect periodic results when these events occur. In addition, a temporary shutdown may become permanent, resulting in a write-down or write-off of the related assets. Industry-wide capacity expansions or the announcement of such expansions have generally led to a decline in the pricing of our chemical products in the affected product line. We cannot provide any assurances that future growth in product demand will be sufficient to utilize any additional capacity.\nIn addition, the cyclical and seasonal nature of the building products industry, which is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic and other conditions such as employment levels, demographic trends, availability of financing, interest rates and consumer confidence, could negatively affect the demand for and pricing of our building products. For example, if interest rates increase, the ability of prospective buyers to finance purchases of home improvement products and invest in new real estate could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial performance. The levels of home repair and remodeling and new construction spending declined significantly in the 2009 through 2011 period as compared to 2008, recovering moderately in the 2012 through 2014 period, as compared to historical levels. In response to these significant market declines, we closed facilities and sold certain businesses and assets, and we may be required to do so again in the future.\nOur operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; the costs associated with compliance with these regulations could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the failure to comply could expose us to material liabilities.\nOur operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations, including laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal and remediation of contaminated sites, at both the national and local levels in the United States. We are also subject to similar laws and regulations in Canada and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nnature of the chemical and building products industries exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury, including, in the case of chemicals, potential releases into the environment. Environmental laws may have a significant effect on the costs of use, transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes. We have and will continue to incur substantial operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws and regulations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling approximately $54 million of which approximately $12 million was classified as a current liability. Our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. As such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters in the range of $52 million to $89 million.\nSome of our significant environmental contingencies include the following matters:\n\u2022 We have entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the LDEQ and various other parties for the environmental remediation of a portion of the Bayou d'Inde area of the Calcasieu River Estuary in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Remedy implementation began in the fourth quarter of 2014 and is expected to be completed during 2016 with a period of monitoring for remedy effectiveness to follow remediation. As of December 31, 2014, we had reserved approximately $18 million for the costs associated with this matter.\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2014, we have reserved approximately $15 million for environmental contingencies related to on-site remediation at the Lake Charles South Facility principally for ongoing remediation of groundwater and soil in connection with our corrective action permit issued pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The remedial activity is primarily related to the operation of a series of well water treatment systems across the Lake Charles South Facility. In addition, remediation of possible soil contamination will be conducted in certain areas. These remedial activities are expected to continue for an extended period of time.\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2014, we have reserved approximately $15 million for environmental contingencies related to remediation activities at our Natrium, West Virginia facility. The remedial actions address National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit requirements related primarily to hexachlorocyclohexane, (commonly referred to as BHC) and mercury. We expect that these remedial actions will be in place for an extended period of time.\nDue to the nature of environmental laws, regulations and liabilities, it is possible that we may not have identified all potentially adverse conditions. Such conditions may not currently exist or be detectable through reasonable methods, or may not be able to be estimable. For example, our Natrium, West Virginia facility and Lake Charles South Facility have both been in operation for over 65 years. There may be significant latent liabilities or future claims arising from the operation of facilities of this age, and we may be required to incur material future remediation or other costs in connection with future actions or developments at these or other facilities.\nWe expect to be continually subjected to increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and that continued compliance will require increased capital expenditures and increased operating costs or may impose restrictions on our present or future operations. It is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of these laws and regulations or their impact on our future earnings and operations. Any increase in these costs, or any material restrictions, could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. However, estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation may be materially lower than actual costs, or we may not be able to quantify potential costs in advance. Actual costs related to any environmental compliance in excess of estimated costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in one or more future periods.\nHeightened interest in environmental regulation, such as climate change issues, has the potential to materially impact our costs and present and future operations. We, and other chemical companies, are currently required to file certain governmental reports relating to GHG emissions. The U.S. Government has considered, and may in the future implement restrictions or other controls on GHG emissions, any of which could require us to incur significant capital expenditures or further restrict our present or future operations.\nIn addition to GHG regulations, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") has recently taken certain actions to limit or control certain pollutants created by companies such as ours. For example:\n\u2022 In January 2013, the EPA issued Clean Air Act emission standards for boilers and incinerators (the \"Boiler MACT regulations\"), which are aimed at controlling emissions of toxic air contaminants. The regulations would require covered facilities to comply by January 2016. The coal fired power plant at our Natrium, West Virginia facility is our source most significantly impacted by the Boiler MACT regulations. Bringing our operations into compliance with the new regulations will require capital expenditures of approximately $30 million.\n\u2022 In April 2012, the EPA issued the PVC MACT regulation to update emissions limits for PVC and copolymer production. The PVC MACT regulation sets standards for major sources of PVC production and establishes certain working practices, as well as monitoring, reporting and record-keeping requirements. We would have until April 2015 to come into compliance with certain requirements of the PVC MACT regulation, and due to compliance extensions we recently received from the relevant government agencies, until April 2016 to come into compliance with other requirements. We have already undertaken significant efforts to achieve compliance by these deadlines. Following the issuance of the PVC MACT regulation, legal challenges were filed by the vinyl industry's trade organization, several vinyl manufacturers and several environmental groups, which will likely impact provisions of the PVC MACT regulation. However, there could be significant changes from the currently existing PVC MACT regulation after all legal challenges have been exhausted, which could require us to incur capital expenditures, or increase our operating costs, to levels significantly higher than what we have previously estimated. We currently estimate the capital expenditures we would incur to comply with the currently existing PVC MACT regulation would be approximately $15 million.\n\u2022 In March 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for mercury emissions from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. These proposed amendments would require improvements in work practices to reduce fugitive mercury emissions and would result in reduced levels of mercury emissions while still allowing the mercury cell facilities to continue to operate. We operate a mercury cell production unit at our Natrium,\nWest Virginia facility. No assurances as to the timing or content of the final regulation, or its ultimate cost to, or impact on us, can be provided.\nThe potential impact of these and/or unrelated future, legislative or regulatory actions on our current or future operations cannot be predicted at this time but could be significant. Such impacts could include the potential for significant compliance costs, including capital expenditures, could result in operating restrictions or could require us to incur significant legal or other costs related to compliance or other activities. Any increase in the costs related to these initiatives, or restrictions on our operations, could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nNatural gas, ethylene, electricity, fuel and raw materials costs, and other external factors beyond our control, as well as changes in the level of activity in the home repair and remodeling and new home construction sectors of the economy, can cause wide fluctuations in our margins.\nThe cost of our natural gas, ethylene, electricity, fuel, raw materials and other costs may not correlate with changes in the prices we receive for our products, either in the direction of the price change or in absolute magnitude. Natural gas, ethylene and other raw materials costs represent a substantial part of our manufacturing costs, and energy costs, in particular electricity and fuel, represent a component of the costs to manufacture building products. Most of the raw materials we use, including ethylene, are commodities and the price of each can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability because of capacity additions or facility operating problems. Other external factors beyond our control can cause volatility in raw materials prices, demand for our products, product prices, sales volumes and margins. These factors include general economic conditions, the level of business activity in the industries that use our products, competitors' actions, international events and circumstances and governmental regulation in the United States and abroad. These factors can also magnify the impact of economic cycles on our business. While we attempt to pass through price increases in energy costs and raw materials, we have been unsuccessful in doing so in some circumstances in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future.\nAdditionally, the businesses of each of our reportable segments are impacted by changes in the North American home repair and remodeling sectors, as well as the new construction sector, which may be significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions such as gross domestic product levels, employment levels, demographic trends, consumer confidence, increases in interest rates and availability of consumer financing for home repair and remodeling projects as well as availability of financing for new home purchases. These factors can lower the demand for and pricing of our products, while we may not be able to reduce our costs by an equivalent amount, which alone or in combination could cause our net sales and net income to materially decrease and, among other things, could require us to recognize impairments of our assets.\nHazards and other risks associated with manufacturing and transporting our products may materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nThere are a number of hazards and other risks associated with chlorovinyls and aromatics chemical manufacturing and building products manufacturing in our current operations, as well as in the use, storage and transportation of related raw materials, products and wastes. The occurrence of any such hazardous or other risk-related events could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our operations as a whole. Some of the hazards and other risks associated with our current operations include:\n\u2022 pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures;\n\u2022 explosions and fires;\n\u2022 inclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022 mechanical failure;\n\u2022 unscheduled downtime;\n\u2022 labor difficulties with workforce under collective bargaining agreements;\n\u2022 transportation interruptions;\n\u2022 transportation accidents involving our chemical products;\n\u2022 remediation complications;\n\u2022 terrorist acts; and\n\u2022 chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards and other risks may cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, any of which could lead to claims or material liability under environmental or other laws. Although we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business. In addition, such insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe are exposed to significant losses from product liability, personal injury and other claims relating to the products we manufacture in each of our reportable segments. Additionally, individuals currently seek, and likely will continue to seek, damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to alleged exposure to chemicals at our facilities or to chemicals otherwise owned, controlled or manufactured by us. We are also subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other matters. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. We maintain and expect to continue to maintain insurance for products liability, workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other claims, but the amount and scope of such insurance may not be adequate or available to cover a claim that is successfully asserted against us. In addition, such insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and working capital;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and, thus, may have greater flexibility to use their cash flows to pursue business opportunities that may improve their businesses and financial performance;\n\u2022 expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates on borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Revolver\") and Term Loan Facility are variable;\n\u2022 increase our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022 limit the amount of additional debt we could borrow.\nWhile we believe we should be able to meet the requirements of the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries' existing debt, our ability to do so depends on many factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, and the impact any one or more of those factors may have on our business at any given time or over any period of time. In addition, if and when we attempt to refinance our debt, it is possible that the debt markets could be less favorable at that time, which could result in higher interest rates on any debt that we refinance, more restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries' existing debt for any debt we refinance and other factors that could be less favorable to our business.\nThe ABL Revolver, the Term Loan Facility and the indentures governing the 4.875 Notes and the 4.625 Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions.\nThe agreements that govern the terms of our and our subsidiaries' existing debt, including the ABL Revolver, the Term Loan Facility and the indentures governing the 4.875 Notes and the 4.625 Notes, impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; make investments and sell assets, including the stock of subsidiaries; pay dividends and make other distributions; purchase our stock; engage in business activities unrelated to our current business; enter into transactions with affiliates; or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nWe are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities as a result of these covenants. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be due and payable immediately and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.\nFurthermore, there are limitations on our ability to borrow the full amount of commitments under the ABL Revolver. Borrowings under the ABL Revolver are limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less customary reserves. In addition, (i) if our availability under the ABL Revolver falls below a certain amount, we will be subject to compliance with a covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0; and (ii) we are subject to a consolidated secured debt ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 under the Term Loan Facility. Our ability to comply with any required fixed charge coverage ratio and\nconsolidated secured debt ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you we will be able to comply with these ratios. A breach of the covenants requiring compliance with these ratios, or with any other covenants in these debt agreements, could result in a default under the ABL Revolver or the Term Loan Facility, as the case may be.\nWe rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for specified feedstocks and services.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from a few key suppliers. If any of these suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present or any future supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials. Any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In connection with our acquisition of the vinyls business of Sasol Limited in 1999, we entered into agreements with Sasol Limited to provide specified feedstocks for our Lake Charles North Facility. These facilities are dependent upon Sasol Limited's infrastructure for services such as wastewater and ground water treatment, site remediation and fire water supply. Any failure of Sasol Limited to perform its obligations under those agreements could adversely affect the operation of the affected facilities and our liquidity and results of operations. The agreements relating to these feedstocks and services had initial terms of one to 10 years. Most of these agreements have been automatically renewed, but may be terminated by Sasol Limited after specified notice periods. If we are required to obtain an alternate source for these feedstocks or services, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms. Additionally, we may be forced to pay additional transportation costs or to invest in capital projects for pipelines or alternate facilities to accommodate railcar or other delivery methods or to replace other services.\nA vendor may choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship due to general economic concerns or concerns relating to the vendor or us, at any time. Any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity, as could significant additional requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or with letters of credit.\nWe have certain material pension and other postretirement welfare benefit (\"OPEB\") obligations. Future funding obligations related to these liabilities could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements or require us to borrow additional funds.\nWe have certain substantial U.S. tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified pension obligations, as well as other OPEB obligations, related to employees and retirees.\nWith respect to the tax-qualified pension obligations, the transfer of legally required pension assets from the tax-qualified pension plans of PPG Industries, Inc. (\"PPG\") to the pension plans established by us in respect of those liabilities was completed during 2014 following our merger with PPG's chemicals business. In addition to the standard minimum funding requirements, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \"Pension Act\") (as amended by the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008) requires companies with tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans to make contributions to such plans as frequently as quarterly in order to meet the \"funding target\" for such plans, as defined in the Pension Act. The failure to meet the funding target could result in the imposition of fines or penalties. Funding obligations with respect to tax-qualified pension plans change due to, among other things, the actual investment return on plan assets. Volatility in the capital markets may have a further negative impact on the funded status of tax-qualified pension plans, which may in turn increase attendant funding obligations. In addition to funded tax-qualified pension obligations, we also have nonqualified pension liabilities that are unfunded, and OPEB obligations to provide retiree health benefits, which are also unfunded.\nThe fair value of pension investment assets was $638.2 million as of December 31, 2014. As of the same date, our projected benefit obligation with respect to these assets was $786.8 million. The underfunded status of the U.S., Canadian, and Taiwanese pension obligations calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2014, was approximately $148.6 million. The unfunded OPEB obligations as of December 31, 2014, were approximately $111.7 million. We funded approximately $9.8 million to the pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2014 and expect to fund an additional $10.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2015.\nWith respect to key assumptions of the pension and OPEB obligations, the weighted average discount rates as of December 31, 2014 are estimated to be 3.98 percent and 3.90 percent, respectively. The weighted average initial healthcare trend rates for our OPEB plans are assumed to be 7.00 percent declining to 4.50 percent over the next 9 years. A 25 basis point increase to the December 31, 2014 discount rates would decrease the estimated benefit obligations for the U.S. and Canadian pension plans by $24.0 million, whereas a 25 basis point decrease would increase the estimated benefit obligations by $25.3 million. A 25 basis point increase to the December 31, 2014 discount rates would decrease the estimated OPEB obligations for the U.S. and Canadian pension plans by $2.7 million, whereas a 25 basis point decrease would increase the estimated benefit obligations by $3.3 million. If the assumed healthcare trend rates were 1 percent higher or 1 percent lower the estimated OPEB benefit obligations for the U.S. and Canadian OPEB plans would increase by $2.4 million or decrease the obligations by $2.1 million, respectively.\nMortality is another key assumption used to determine the benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The Company has historically utilized the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality. On October 27, 2014, the SOA published updated mortality tables for U.S. plans (\"RP-2014\") and an updated generational improvement scale (\"MP-2014\"), which both reflect improved longevity. The Company adopted the SOA's new RP-2014 and MP-2014 as published by the SOA for purposes of measuring pension and OPEB benefit obligations at year-end. The change to the mortality assumption increased the year-end pension and OPEB obligations by $74 million and $2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.\nGiven the pension assets and obligations, and subject to the foregoing variables and the uncertainties associated therewith, it is possible that we could be required to make substantial contributions in future years to the pension plans. These contributions could restrict available cash for our operations, capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nAs for OPEB benefits and nonqualified pension liabilities, the obligations to make payments with respect to these liabilities in the future may increase for several reasons. For example, with respect to OPEB, healthcare costs may escalate. These obligations will require annual funding that could restrict cash available to us for use for other purposes.\nWhile we intend to comply with any future funding obligations for our pension and OPEB plans through the use of cash from operations, there can be no assurance that we will generate enough cash to do so and also meet our other required or intended cash uses. Our inability to fund these obligations through cash from operations could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe chemicals industry is highly competitive. Many of the competitors of our chlorovinyls and aromatics chemicals businesses are larger and have greater financial and other resources and less debt than us. Moreover, barriers to entry are low in most product lines of our chlorovinyls and aromatics chemicals businesses. Capacity additions or technological advances by existing or future competitors could also create greater competition, particularly in pricing. We cannot provide assurance that we will have access to the financing necessary to upgrade our facilities in response to technological advances or other competitive developments.\nIn addition, we compete with national and international manufacturers of vinyl-based building and home improvement products. Some of these companies are larger and have greater financial resources and less debt than we have. Accordingly, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we have. Some of these competitors, who compete with our building product lines, may also be able to compete more aggressively in pricing and could take a greater share of sales and cause us to lose business from our customers. Many of the competitors of our building products business have operated in the industry longer than we have. Additionally, our building products face competition from alternative materials, such as wood, metal, fiber cement and masonry in siding, wood and aluminum in windows and iron and cement in pipe and fittings. An increase in competition from other vinyl exterior building products manufacturers or alternative building materials could cause us to lose customers and lead to decreases in net sales and profitability. To the extent we lose customers in the renovation and remodeling markets, we would likely have to market to the new home construction market, which historically has experienced more significant fluctuations in demand.\nWe rely heavily on third party transportation, which subjects us to risks and costs that we cannot control, and which risks and costs may materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely heavily on railroads, barges and other shipping companies to transport raw materials to the manufacturing facilities used by each of our businesses and to ship finished products to customers. These transport operations are subject to various hazards and risks, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards, as well as interstate transportation regulations. In addition, the methods of transportation we utilize, including shipping chlorine and other chemicals by railroad, may be subject to additional, more stringent and more costly regulations in the future. If we are delayed or unable to ship finished products or unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any such new regulations or public policy changes related to transportation safety, or these transportation companies' failure to operate properly, or if there were significant changes in the cost of these services due to new or additional regulations, or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship goods, which could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and costs of operations. For example, our costs of transporting our chlor-alkali products, particularly railroad shipment costs, are a significant portion of our cost of sales, and have been increasing over the past several years. If these cost increases continue, and we are unable to control them or pass the increased costs onto customers, our profitability in our chlor-alkali segment would be negatively impacted.\nOperation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") information systems, and the conversion from multiple ERP systems to a fewer number of ERP systems, may negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our information systems infrastructure in order to process orders, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain regulatory compliance and otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. We operate on multiple ERP information systems, which complicate our processing, reporting and analysis of business transactions and other information. Since we must process and reconcile our information from multiple systems, the chance of errors is increased, and we may incur significant additional costs related thereto. Inconsistencies in the information from multiple ERP systems could adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently and may result in heightened risk to our ability to maintain our books and records and comply with regulatory requirements. Further, from time to time we may transition a portion of our operations from one of our ERP systems to another. For example, we are in the process of transitioning our chemicals division from operating on multiple ERP systems to a single ERP system. The transition to a different ERP system or to a single ERP system from multiple ERP systems involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention away from normal daily business operations;\n\u2022 loss of or delays in accessing data;\n\u2022 increased demand on our operations support personnel;\n\u2022 initial dependence on unfamiliar systems while training personnel to use new systems; and\n\u2022 increased operating expenses resulting from training, conversion and transition support activities.\nAny of the foregoing could result in a material increase in information technology compliance or other related costs and could materially negatively impact our operations. In addition, any failures or delays in the transition to a single ERP system in our chemicals division, or any other division, could delay and/or impede our ability to order materials and services, manufacture products, fill and ship customer orders, invoice customers, generate management reports and timely prepare financial statements and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting, and thus, could unfavorably impact our net sales, profitability, business operations and regulatory compliance in a significant manner.\nA significant portion of our hourly workers are represented by labor unions and therefore subject to collective bargaining agreements; if we are unable to enter into new agreements or renew existing agreements before they expire, our workers subject to collective bargaining agreements could engage in strikes or other labor actions that could materially disrupt our ability to conduct our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 6,000 active employees. Approximately 1,600 or 27 percent, of these employees are represented by labor unions and are therefore subject to collective bargaining agreements that will expire by the end of 2018. At our Lake Charles South Facility and Natrium, West Virginia facility, two of our largest facilities, approximately 61 percent and 68 percent, respectively, of the workforce operate under collective bargaining agreements.\nIf we are unable to reach new collective bargaining agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to conduct our operations. New collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in the future.\nIf our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings, which could be significant.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable) and other intangible assets are reviewed if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which could be significant.\nWe may evaluate asset dispositions, asset acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that may impact our results of operations, and we may not achieve the expected results from these transactions.\nFrom time to time, and subject to the agreements governing our existing debt or otherwise, we may enter into agreements to dispose of certain assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of any such assets at any anticipated prices, or at all, or that any such sale will occur during any anticipated time frame. In addition, subject to the agreements governing our existing debt or otherwise, we may engage in business combinations, purchases of assets or contractual arrangements or joint ventures. Subject to the agreements governing our existing debt or otherwise, some of these transactions may be financed with our additional borrowings. The integration of any business we may acquire may be disruptive to us and may result in a significant diversion of management attention and operational resources. Additionally, we may suffer a loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, loss of revenues, increases in costs or other difficulties. If the expected efficiencies and synergies from any such transactions are not fully realized, our results of operations could be adversely affected, because of the costs associated with such transactions or otherwise. Other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of our businesses, thereby yielding increased short-term liquidity, but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term. The failure to realize the expected long-term benefits of any one or more of these transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur participation in joint ventures exposes us to a number of risks, including risks of shared control.\nFrom time to time we enter into joint ventures, such as our building products strategic joint venture arrangements with several customers, our ownership of a 60 percent interest in the TCI joint venture and our joint venture in RS Cogen. We expect that we will evaluate opportunities to enter into additional joint ventures in the future, subject to any applicable restrictions arising in connection with the agreements governing our existing debt. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If there are differences in views among joint venture participants in how to operate the joint venture that result in delayed decisions or the failure to make decisions, or our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan and fulfill its obligations. In that case, we may be required to write down the value of our investment in a joint venture, increase the level of financial or other commitments to the joint venture or, if we have contractual agreements with the joint venture, our operations may be materially adversely affected. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we\nmust translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in various currencies might occur in one or many of such currencies over time. From time to time, we may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, in particular, the Canadian dollar, would not materially adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, we are exposed to volatility in interest rates. When appropriate, we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. We cannot assure you, however, that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products or cause standard business processes to become ineffective, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of information or damage to our reputation. While we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure, network disruption or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements relating to future events and our intentions, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the future.

Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have a material adverse effect on our actual future results, performance or achievements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to us and our business, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled \"Risk Factors\" and in our subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any duty to update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations, except as required by law.", "PERMNO": 75222, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "AXLL"}
