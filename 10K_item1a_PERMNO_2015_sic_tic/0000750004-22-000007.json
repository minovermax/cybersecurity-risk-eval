RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business operations. You should also refer to the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Forward-Looking Statements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business. Except where the context otherwise indicates, references below to the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cours\u201d and \u201cus\u201d include all of our subsidiaries.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Relating to Economic and Current Conditions Impacting us and our Business\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, continue to and, in the future, could significantly impact our operations and, should negative impacts such as significant player engagement develop, adversely affect and continue to adversely affect our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u2022We have signed definitive agreements to sell our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of the Pending Divestitures, that the Pending Divestitures will yield additional value for our stockholders or that the Pending Divestitures will not adversely impact our business, financial results, results of operations, cash flows or stock price.\n\u2022Failure to successfully execute on our new strategy and impending rebranding initiative could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial information.\n\u2022Our future results of operations may be negatively impacted by slow growth or declines in the replacement cycle of gaming machines and by the slow growth of new gaming jurisdictions or slow addition of casinos in existing jurisdictions.\n\u2022We have foreign operations which expose us to business and legal risks, including compliance with anti-corruption laws, and a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in British Pounds Sterling, Australian Dollars and Euros, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Structure\n\u2022Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which may not be successful.\n\u2022Agreements governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness and require us to make payments on our indebtedness. Were this to occur, we would not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated indebtedness.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit agreement to finance required capital expenditures under new contracts and meet our other cash needs or satisfy our minimum liquidity covenant. These obligations require a significant amount of cash, which would reduce our available liquidity.\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industries\n\u2022We operate in highly competitive industries, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses.\n\u2022Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to, and offer products and services that keep pace with, changing technology and evolving industry standards.\n\u2022We invest significant resources in our R&D efforts, which may not lead to successful or commercially viable new technologies, services or products.\n\u2022Our success depends on our ability to produce new and innovative products and services that respond to customer demand and create strong and sustained player appeal.\n\u2022We may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of SciPlay being a standalone public company, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Relating to our Technology\n\u2022Our success depends on the security and integrity of the systems and products we offer, and security breaches or other disruptions could compromise our information or the information of our customers and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n\u2022Our business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information.\n\u2022We rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Political or Other Regulatory Factors\n\u2022We and our industries are subject to strict government regulations that may limit our existing operations, have an adverse impact on our ability to grow and affect our license eligibility or expose us to fines or other penalties.\n\u2022Legislative interpretation and enforcement of certain gaming could adversely affect financial performance and reputation.\n\u2022We may not be able to capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of digital gaming or other trends and changes in the gaming, social and digital gaming industries, including due to laws and regulations governing these industries.\n\u2022Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of our tax positions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022We have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring costs, the benefits of which are unpredictable and may not be achieved.\n\u2022We may incur additional impairment charges.\n\u2022We depend on our key employees and rely on skilled employees with creative and technical backgrounds.\nRisks Relating to Discontinued Operations\n\u2022Unfavorable economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have and could continue to significantly disrupt our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses.\n\u2022Within our Lottery business, we often enter into joint ventures or other business relationships in foreign jurisdictions, which presents additional risks, including not realizing the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate.\n\u2022Our Lottery business depends heavily on our ability to win, maintain and renew our long-term Lottery contracts, and we could lose substantial revenue if we are unable to renew such contracts on substantially similar terms or at all.\n\u2022The success of our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses depends on our ability to produce new and innovative products and services that respond to customer demand and create strong and sustained player appeal. If we fail to do so, we could lose business to our competitors.\n\u2022Our Lottery business depends on suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. The risk factors generally are separated into seven groups: risks relating to economic and current conditions impacting us and our business, risks relating to our capital structure, risks relating to our business and our industries, risks relating to our technology, risks relating to legal, political and other regulatory factors, general risk factors and risks relating to discontinued operations.\nRisks Relating to Economic and Current Conditions Impacting us and our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, continue to and, in the future, could significantly impact our operations and, should negative impacts such as significant player engagement develop, adversely affect and continue to adversely affect our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, and public perception thereof, have contributed to consumer unease and may continue to lead to decreased discretionary spending and consumer travel, which have had, and will continue to have, a negative effect on us, especially in our Gaming business. Other future health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks or variants of COVID-19, such as Delta and Omicron, could do the same. We cannot predict the ultimate effects that the outbreak of COVID-19, any resulting unfavorable social, political and economic conditions and decrease in discretionary spending or travel would have on us, as they would be expected to impact our customers, suppliers and business partners in varied ways in different communities. In our Gaming business, especially our Participation gaming, SciPlay business segment and iGaming business segment, our revenue is largely driven by players\u2019 disposable incomes and level of gaming activity. The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has led to economic and financial uncertainty for many consumers and has reduced, and may continue to reduce or maintain at low amounts, the disposable incomes of players across all of our business units. This resulted in fewer patrons visiting casinos , whether land-based or online, and lower amounts spent per casino visit and may result in, reduced spend on online gambling activities, which negatively impact the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of our casino customers, their ability to purchase or lease our products and services and revenues to our online casino partners and, therefore, our iGaming business revenue.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting unfavorable economic conditions have also impacted, and could continue to impact, the ability of our customers to make timely payments to us. These unfavorable conditions have caused, and could continue to or may cause, some of our Gaming customers to temporarily close gaming venues or declare bankruptcy, which would adversely affect our business. In prior years, our Gaming business has expanded the use of extended payment term financing for gaming machine purchases, and we expect to continue to provide a higher level of extended payment term financing in this business until demand from our customers for such financings abates or our business model changes. These arrangements may increase our collection risk, and if customers are not able to pay us, whether as a result of financial difficulties, bankruptcy or otherwise, we may incur provisions for bad debt related to our inability to collect certain receivables. In addition, both extended payment term financing and operating leases result in a delay in our receipt of cash, which reduces our cash balance, liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to changing economic events. In 2020, we saw a negative impact on future demand of certain Gaming products as a result of COVID-19, which has resulted and, depending on the evolving nature of the pandemic, has the potential to later result in material inventory charges, which could increase our cost of products and decrease our gross margin. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $48 million in charges related to inventory in our Gaming business segment. COVID-19 has also caused significant volatility in both the credit and equity markets, having led to an economic downturn and having the continued potential to lead to further economic downturn. The difficulty or inability of our customers to generate or obtain adequate levels of capital to finance their ongoing operations may reduce their ability to purchase our products and services. Suppliers to our iGaming business may suffer financial difficulties and may not be able to offer their services and products, which could restrict the provision of our services and negatively impact our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We did not have any material charges related to inventory during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nVarious gambling regulators have implemented additional responsible and safer gambling measures relating to our iGaming casino business including the implementation of bet limits, spin speeds, deposit limits and bonusing, which could negatively impact our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, particularly if additional gambling regulators follow suit.\nFurthermore, this outbreak of COVID-19 has caused, and may continue to cause us and certain of our suppliers, to implement temporary adjustment of work schemes allowing employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. In 2020, we took measures to monitor and reduce the impact of the outbreak, including putting in place a global crisis monitoring team, protocols for responding when employees are infected and enhanced cleaning procedures at all sites, but we cannot assure these will be sufficient to mitigate the risks faced by our and our partners\u2019 work forces. We also took measures to reduce operating costs and ensure liquidity given the uncertain impact of COVID-19 on revenue, deferred all non-critical capital expenditures, and implemented a number of employee-related actions. However, we experienced and may still experience lower work efficiency and productivity, which may adversely affect our service quality, and our business operations were and could again be disrupted if and/or when any of our employees has been or is suspected of infection, since this has and may cause our employees to be quarantined and/or our offices to be temporarily shut down. We may continue to incur some costs for our operations, and our revenues could be impacted again. As a result of some of the above developments, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the full fiscal year of 2020 were adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The extent to which this outbreak further impacts our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of this outbreak and the actions taken by governmental authorities and us to contain it or treat its impact. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on each of our business segments and measures taken by us in response to COVID-19, see section captioned \u201cBusiness Overview - Highlights, including recent developments - Impacts of COVID-19 on Business Operations, Financial Results and Liquidity\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThere can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of the Pending Divestitures, that the Pending Divestitures will yield additional value for our stockholders or that the Pending Divestitures will not adversely impact our business, financial results, results of operations, cash flows or stock price.\nOn June 29, 2021, we announced our intention to divest our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses. On September 27, 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Sports Betting business to Endeavor in a cash and stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive $1 billion in cash and approximately 7.6 million shares of Endeavor Class A common stock (valued at approximately $200 million as of the purchase agreement date), subject to customary purchase price closing adjustments. On October 27, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Lottery business to Brookfield for total consideration of $6.05 billion consisting of $5.825 billion in cash and an earn-out of up to $225 million based on the achievement of certain EBITDA targets in 2022 and 2023, subject to customary purchase price closing adjustments.\nThe Pending Divestitures expose us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including continued diversion of management\u2019s time to the processes; the incurrence of significant expenses associated with the review and pursuit of any transaction; increased difficulties in attracting, retaining or motivating key management personnel; the potential loss of key customers, suppliers, vendors and other key business partners\u037e the need to provide transition services, which may result in additional costs and the diversion of resources and focus\u037e a reduction of net investments in our international subsidiaries available for hedging, which could result in increased volatility in our operating results; and exposure to potential litigation. Any of these factors could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or stock price.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to realize the anticipated operational, strategic or financial benefits from the Pending Divestitures including (i) our ability to transform and execute on our strategic vision to become the leading cross-platform global game company and (ii) any repayment, refinancing and/or restructuring of existing indebtedness on terms acceptable to us with net proceeds of the Pending Divestitures. There can be no assurance that any of these transactions and anticipated benefits will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. The proposed transactions and anticipated benefits are dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other factors, market conditions (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), industry trends, regulatory developments, litigation and the interest of third parties in these businesses. See the section below captioned \u201cRisks Relating to Discontinued Operations\u201d for risk factors relating to our held-for-sale Lottery and Sports Betting businesses.\nFailure to successfully execute on our new strategy and impending rebranding initiative could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial information.\nWe are executing a new strategy in becoming the leading, cross-platform global game company (more fully described in in Part I, Item 1 above). Jointly with our new strategy, we also are in the process of rebranding our Company and operate under a new name and logo. Successful execution on our strategy may present unexpected challenges and uncertainties. We may incur integration and optimization expenses to execute and facilitate our strategies, including costs necessary to complete the Pending Divestitures.\nOur new business strategy is to invest in great content and franchises across land-based, digital and mobile platforms, expand in high-growth markets, enable a seamless player experience with innovative platforms, deleverage and maximize cash flow to fuel investment and be driven by high-performing talent and culture. Our strategy is focused upon growth including growing our digital revenue mix and pursuit of acquisitions supportive of our strategic goals. For additional information on risks related to our acquisition strategy, see the risk factor captioned \u201cOur inability to complete acquisitions and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our growth or disrupt our plans and operations.\u201d If we are not successful in accomplishing each component of our new business strategy, we may suffer negative impacts on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the success of our new brand and name will be integral in allowing our new strategy and business focus to be successful. Developing and maintaining awareness of our Company and our brand is important to attracting new and existing customers to our products. The importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our industry intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Although we plan to invest substantial resources to promote our brand, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed under our former brand. Even if our brand recognition and loyalty increases, this may not result in increased revenue and profitability. For these reasons, our rebranding initiative may not produce the benefits expected, could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future results of operations may be negatively impacted by slow growth or declines in the replacement cycle of gaming machines and by the slow growth of new gaming jurisdictions or slow addition of casinos in existing jurisdictions.\nDemand for our Gaming products and services is driven by the replacement of existing gaming machines in existing casinos, the establishment of new jurisdictions, the opening of additional casinos in existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos. Slow growth or declines in the replacement cycle of gaming machines have reduced and will continue to reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and have resulted and could continue to result in material inventory charges, which could increase our cost of products and decrease our gross margin. We recorded charges related to inventory of $48 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 in our Gaming business segment primarily due to the COVID-19 disruption impacting future demand combined with a reassessment of our Gaming product strategy. We did not have any material charges related to inventory during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe opening of new casinos, expansion of existing casinos and replacement of existing gaming machines in existing casinos fluctuate with demand, economic conditions, regulatory approvals and the availability of financing. Originally these had been negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While those negative effects have abated, there is still potential for negative effects if the pandemic worsens. In addition, the expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions can be a protracted process. In the U.S., U.K. and other international jurisdictions in which we operate, governments usually require a public referendum and legislative action before establishing or expanding gaming. Any of these factors could delay, restrict or prohibit the expansion of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have foreign operations which expose us to business and legal risks, including compliance with anti-corruption laws, and a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in British Pounds Sterling, Australian Dollars and Euros, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks.\nWe are a global business and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from operations outside of the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived approximately 28% of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S.\nOur consolidated financial results are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because portions of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the British Pound Sterling, the Australian dollar and the Euro. Such fluctuations may arise from inflation, government debt or other causes. Exchange rate fluctuations have in the past adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the value of our assets outside the U.S. in the future. If a foreign currency is devalued in a jurisdiction in which we are paid in such currency, we may require our customers to pay higher amounts for our products, which they may be unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, a portion of our debt is denominated in Euros, and the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more member states of the EU or, in extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the Euro entirely, could adversely affect the value of our Euro-denominated debt, and the treatment of debt obligations previously denominated in Euros would be uncertain. This uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our foreign operations, including on our Euro-denominated debt. In addition, if such events occurred, the financial and capital markets within and outside Europe could constrict and negatively impact our ability to finance our business. Such events could also cause a substantial reduction in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact our customers and our business.\nOur operations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to additional risks customarily associated with such operations, including: the complexity of foreign laws, regulations and markets; the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions; the impact of foreign labor laws and disputes; the ability to attract and retain key personnel in foreign jurisdictions; the economic, tax and regulatory policies of local governments; compliance with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit us and our agents from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; compliance with applicable sanctions regimes regarding dealings with certain persons or countries; import and export restrictions and other trade barriers, including imposition of tariffs; and increased trade tensions between countries or political and economic unions. Certain of these laws also contain provisions that require accurate record keeping and further require companies to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective or an employee or intermediary fails to comply with the applicable regulations, we may be subject to criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. Any such violation could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, our international business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by terrorist activity, political unrest or other economic or political uncertainties. Further, U.S. and foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales.\nFor example, in 2018 the U.S. announced certain trade actions under Section 232, and Section 301 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, including tariff increases on several imported products. These U.S. tariffs, along with other U.S. trade actions, have triggered retaliatory actions by certain affected countries, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). In January 2020, the United States and the PRC signed a limited trade deal in which the PRC agreed to purchase more products from the U.S. in exchange for a reduction in planned and existing tariffs. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. and other countries, and trade negotiations between the U.S. and the PRC, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, tariffs and other trade restrictions may be imposed on or otherwise become applicable to our product offerings or supply chain, and the impact of these trade actions on our business remains uncertain. While tariffs and other trade actions by the U.S. and other countries have not yet had a significant impact on our business and we are implementing measures to limit the impact of tariffs on our cost structure, we cannot predict further developments. Tariffs and other trade actions could result in increases in our cost of doing business and in the sale prices of certain of our products and could negatively impact demand for our products, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions.\nIn addition, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including difficulties in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with entering jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company.\nWe may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions and our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nUnfavorable U.S. and international economic conditions, or decreased discretionary spending or travel due to other factors such as terrorist activity or threat thereof, civil unrest, health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks, or public perception thereof or other economic or political uncertainties, have adversely affected our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including recession, economic slowdown, decreased liquidity in the financial markets, decreased availability of credit, relatively high rates of unemployment and inflation, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business. Socio-political factors such as terrorist activity or threat thereof, civil unrest or other economic or political uncertainties, or health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks, or public perception thereof that contribute to consumer unease may also result in decreased discretionary spending or travel by consumers and have a negative effect on our businesses. We cannot fully predict the effects that unfavorable social, political and economic conditions, economic uncertainties and public health crises and any resulting decrease in discretionary spending or travel would have on us, as they would be expected to impact our customers, suppliers and business partners in varied ways. For a description of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises, see the risk factor captioned \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, continue to and, in the future, could significantly impact our operations and, should negative impacts such as significant player engagement develop, continue to adversely affect our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\u201d In our Gaming business, especially our Participation gaming business, our revenue is largely driven by players\u2019 disposable incomes and level of gaming activity which may be reduced by unfavorable economic conditions. A further or extended decline in disposable income may\nresult in reduced play levels on our Participation gaming machines, causing our results of operations and cash flows from these products to decline. Additionally, higher travel and other costs may adversely affect the number of players visiting our customers\u2019 casinos. Adverse changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences, resulting in fewer patrons visiting casinos and reduced play levels, could also be driven by factors such as an unstable job market, outbreaks of contagious diseases or public perception thereof or fears of terrorism or other violence. A decline in play levels has negatively impacted the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of our casino customers and their ability to purchase or lease our products and services.\nUnfavorable economic conditions have also impacted, and could continue to impact, the ability of our Gaming customers to make timely payments to us. These conditions, and the concentration of certain outstanding Gaming segment receivables, may increase our collection risks and materially impact our estimate of receivables allowance for credit losses. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions have caused, and may cause in the future, some of our Gaming customers to temporarily close gaming venues or ultimately declare bankruptcy, which adversely affects our business. Consistent with other suppliers in the gaming industry, our Gaming business has recently expanded the use of extended payment term financing for gaming machine purchases, and we expect to continue to provide a higher level of extended payment term financing in this business until demand from our customers for such financings abates or our business model changes. These financing arrangements may increase our collection risk, and if customers are not able to pay us, whether as a result of financial difficulties, bankruptcy or otherwise, we may incur provisions for bad debt related to our inability to collect certain receivables. In addition, both extended payment term financing and operating leases result in a delay in our receipt of cash, which reduces our cash balance, liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to changing economic events. Unfavorable economic conditions may also result in volatility in the credit and equity markets. The difficulty or inability of our customers to generate or obtain adequate levels of capital to finance their ongoing operations may reduce their ability to purchase our products and services. Refer to Note 7 for international locations with significant concentrations of our receivables with terms longer than one year.\nIn our iGaming business based on a Participation model, our revenue is largely driven by disposable incomes and level of player activity. Unfavorable economic conditions have previously reduced and may later reduce the disposable incomes of end users consuming the services, which could negatively impact revenues for the iGaming business. Suppliers to our iGaming business may suffer financial difficulties and may not be able to offer their services and products, which could restrict the provision of our services and negatively impact our revenues. Various gambling regulators have implemented additional responsible and safer gambling measures relating to our iGaming casino business as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the implementation of bet limits, spin speeds, deposit limits and bonusing, which could negatively impact on our revenues, particularly if additional gambling regulators follow suit.\nThere are ongoing concerns regarding the debt burden of certain countries, particularly in Europe and South America, and their ability to meet their future financial obligations, which have resulted in downgrades of the debt ratings for these countries. We currently operate in, and our growth strategy may involve pursuing expansion or business opportunities in certain of these jurisdictions, such as Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Puerto Rico, Turkey and Ukraine among others. These sovereign debt concerns, whether real or perceived, could result in a recession, prolonged economic slowdown, or otherwise negatively impact the general health and stability of the economies in these countries or more broadly. In more severe cases, this could result in a limitation on the availability or flow of capital, thereby restricting our liquidity and negatively impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Structure\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $8,690 million, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, consisting primarily of borrowings under our credit agreement, and Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2021, our total available liquidity (excluding our SciPlay business segment, but including cash and cash equivalents totaling $44 million of the businesses held for sale) was $903 million, which included $638 million of undrawn availability under SGI\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nOur level of indebtedness could affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness; require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry or competitive developments or conditions; and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate or in pursuing our strategic objectives. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of higher interest rates as a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest. If interest rates increase, the interest payment obligations under our non-hedged variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our results of operations, cash flows and\nfinancial condition would be negatively impacted. All of these factors became more severe given the unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainties and decrease in discretionary spending and consumer travel as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have less debt than we do.\nCertain of our variable rate debt, including under certain of our debt agreements and the SciPlay Revolver, relies on LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority mostly phased out LIBOR by the end of 2021, extending to the end of June 2023 for U.S. dollar LIBOR only. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. In December 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 that substantially followed legislation proposed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York establishing the SOFR as a commercially reasonable substitute for and commercially substantial equivalent to LIBOR. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR, such as SOFR, or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt. We may in the future pursue additional amendments to the agreements underlying this debt to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As a result, additional financing to replace our LIBOR-based debt may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, which in turn are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and our other obligations. Our results of operations and general economic and financial conditions have been negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which made it more difficult for us to meet our debt obligations from cash flows from operating activities.\nWe are required to make scheduled payments of principal on the term loans borrowed under our credit agreement, and our credit agreement requires that a portion of our excess cash flow be applied to prepay amounts borrowed under our credit agreement. We are also required to repay the entire principal amount of our Senior Notes at their maturity (see Note 15). We have also, from time to time, repurchased or otherwise retired or refinanced our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise and may continue to do so in the future. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material. If we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or before maturity, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, especially uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur lenders, including the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement or in the SciPlay Revolver, may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards, which could make it more difficult for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility or the SciPlay Revolver or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected if we were unable to draw funds under our revolving credit facility or the SciPlay Revolver because of a lender default or to obtain other cost-effective financing. Any default by a lender in its obligation to fund its commitment under our revolving credit facility or the SciPlay Revolver (or its participation in letters of credit) could limit our liquidity to the extent of the defaulting lender\u2019s commitment. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to meet our commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot assure that any of these actions could be completed on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. Moreover, our existing debt agreements contain, and our future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness and require us to make payments on our indebtedness. Were this to occur, we would not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated indebtedness.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement and the SciPlay Revolver and the indentures governing our Senior Notes, impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions\non our activities that may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in new business activities. Subject to certain exceptions, our credit facilities and/or indentures restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or purchase other debt;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022make loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022engage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022engage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into arrangements that would prohibit us from granting liens or restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer assets; and\n\u2022alter the business we conduct.\nIn addition, prior to the Credit Agreement Amendment and the Credit Agreement Extension Agreement, the SGI credit agreement contained a covenant that was tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and required us to not exceed a maximum consolidated net first lien leverage ratio of 5.00x Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), with this ratio stepping down to 4.75x beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 and 4.50x beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021. We amended the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant in the credit agreement with the requisite lenders under SGI\u2019s revolving credit facility on May 8, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Agreement Amendment\u201d) and subsequently extended the Credit Agreement Amendment on October 8, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Agreement Extension Amendment\u201d) to implement a financial covenant relief period, which extends the relief period through the first quarter of 2022. As a result, (a) SGI is not required to maintain compliance with the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant during the Covenant Relief Period, (b) the step down of the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant following the Covenant Relief Period was revised, (c) SGI must maintain liquidity (excluding SciPlay) of at least $275 million during the Covenant Relief Period, (d) SGI is restricted in its ability to further incur indebtedness and liens, make restricted payments and investments and prepay junior indebtedness during the Covenant Relief Period, subject to certain exceptions and further subject, in some instances, to maintaining minimum liquidity (excluding SciPlay) of at least $400 million and (e) a LIBOR floor of 0.500% was established on borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the Covenant Relief Period.\nThe following table summarizes the revised consolidated net first lien leverage ratio and Consolidated EBITDA:\nAdditionally, the SciPlay Revolver requires that SciPlay maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio not to exceed 2.50x and maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 4.00x. Future financing arrangements may impose similar requirements.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on us, especially in our Gaming business. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will continue to maintain liquidity sufficient to satisfy our current obligations or comply with the minimum liquidity requirement set forth in SGC\u2019s credit agreement or return to compliance with the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant following the Covenant Relief Period.\nWe also cannot assure that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the agreements governing our indebtedness if for any reason we are unable to comply with these obligations or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit agreement to finance required capital expenditures under new contracts and meet our other cash needs or satisfy our minimum liquidity covenant. These obligations require a significant amount of cash, which would reduce our available liquidity.\nOur Gaming operations business generally requires significant upfront capital expenditures for gaming machine, software customization and implementation, systems and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration. In connection with a Gaming operations contract, our customers often obtain new gaming machines, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to fulfill the contract.\nHistorically, we have funded these upfront cash outflows through cash flows generated from operations, available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, which are negatively affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront cash outflows and other cash needs on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to fulfill certain contracts, which could result in our losing business or restrict our ability to grow, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Moreover, we may not realize the return on investment that we anticipate on such contracts due to a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated retail sales or amounts wagered, higher than anticipated capital or operating expenses and unanticipated regulatory developments or litigation. We may not have adequate liquidity to pursue other aspects of our strategy, including bringing our products and services to new customers or new or underpenetrated geographies or pursuing strategic acquisitions. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, or refinance or repay existing debt, we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, especially under the current unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnder SGI\u2019s amended revolving credit facility we currently have a minimum liquidity requirement (excluding SciPlay) of at least $275 million during the Covenant Relief Period and have further restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness and liens, make restricted payments and investments and prepay junior indebtedness during the Covenant Relief Period, subject to certain exceptions and further subject, in some instances, to maintaining minimum liquidity (excluding SciPlay) of at least $400 million. See Note 15 for details regarding the Credit Agreement Amendment and the Credit Agreement Extension Amendment. Therefore, even if we do have liquidity available to support our current cash needs, we may not be able to access that liquidity while still remaining in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. We cannot assure that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the minimum liquidity covenant, or will be able to obtain additional liquidity to cure such a violation, if for any reason we are unable to comply with that obligation.\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industries\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses.\nGaming\nOur Gaming business faces significant competition, not only from traditional gaming suppliers, but also from a number of other domestic and foreign providers, some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience than we do. In some cases, we compete against gaming operators, including illegal or unregulated operators. Additionally, we\nface competition from smaller gaming companies that have established certain competitive products in recent years and are able to focus their resources on developing a smaller number of high-performing products.\nWe compete on the basis of the content, features, quality, functionality, accuracy, reliability, price and financing terms of our products and services, and the responsiveness of our services. If we do not consistently deliver popular, high-quality games in a timely manner, or if consumers prefer competing products, our business might suffer. Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to our existing products. These products or enhancements may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality. Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, potentially taking sales away from them or reducing our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. We have experienced pricing pressures in the past, including in 2020 and in 2021. These competing products may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. We also compete based on the extent of our sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We on occasion provide extended payment term financing for product purchases, and we expect to continue to provide extended payment term financing until the impacts of COVID-19 and demand for such financing abate. We have also offered customers discounts and other offers and modified pricing and other contractual terms in connection with the sale or placement of our products and services. Our competitors may provide a greater amount of financing or better offers and terms than we do, and this may impact demand for our Gaming products and services. We cannot assure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers or agree to modify contractual terms in ways that are unfavorable to us, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe also compete to obtain space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors, and some of our product lines may compete against each other for this space. Consolidation of casino and other operators, increased competition among operators and reductions in capital expenditures by operators have significantly increased the level of competition among gaming suppliers and may do so in the future. Casino operators focus on performance, longevity, player appeal and price when making their purchasing decisions. Competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines and more game themes than ours may have an advantage in obtaining and retaining placements in casinos. Our Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world.\nWe also face high levels of competition in the supply of products and services for newly legalized gaming jurisdictions and for openings of new or expanded casinos. Our success depends on our ability to successfully enter new markets and compete successfully for new business, especially in the face of declining demand and lengthened cycles for gaming machine replacements as a result of COVID-19 disruptions.\nSciPlay\nSciPlay, which includes social casino games and from which we derive substantially all of our SciPlay revenue, is a rapidly evolving industry with low barriers to entry. Businesses can easily launch online or on mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with various established companies in these markets. The market for our games is also characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent launches of new games and features, changes in player needs and behavior, disruption by innovative entrants and evolving business models and industry standards. As a result, our industry is constantly changing games and business models in order to adopt and optimize new technologies, increase cost efficiency and adapt to player preferences.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy depends on our continuous ability to attract and retain players, adapt to the emergence of new mobile hardware or operating systems, expand the market for our games, maintain a technological edge and offer new capabilities to players. We also compete with social gaming companies, including those that offer social casino games such as Playtika, Product Madness/Big Fish Games (Aristocrat), Zynga Inc., DoubleU Games/Double Down Interactive, GSN/Bash Gaming and Huuuge games, some of which have no connection to regulated real money gaming, and many of those companies have a base of existing players that is larger than ours. In some cases, we compete against real money gaming operators who have expanded their games to include social casino games and have in the past leveraged their land-based gaming relationship with us to license social casino game content from us. In those cases, customers of such real money gaming operators may choose to play our content as it is offered by the operator and not as it is offered by our social casino games, detrimentally impacting our results.\nSome of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources and, in some cases, the ability to rapidly combine online platforms with traditional staffing and contingent worker solutions. These companies may use these advantages to develop different platforms and services to compete with our games, spend more on advertising and brand marketing, invest more in research and development or respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities,\ntechnologies, standards, regulatory conditions or player preferences or requirements. As a result, our players may decide to stop playing our games or switch to our competitors\u2019 games.\nMoreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others, including our current or future third-party suppliers. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of existing or prospective players. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenue from existing and new buyers. If we are unable to compete effectively, successfully and at reasonable cost against our existing and future competitors, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe offer players regular free play and frequent discounts for purchases of virtual coins to extend play in connection with our social casino gaming business. We cannot assure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our players, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\niGaming\nOur iGaming business is also subject to significant competition. Our iGaming business focuses on the supply of game content to online casino operators, and there are a number of competitors in that industry, including from illegal or unregulated operators.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in offering our technology, content and services to digital gaming operators as we expect to face intense competition from our traditional competitors in the igaming industry and a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or, in some cases, the operators themselves), some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience in this area than we do. In addition, there is a risk that the authorization of the provision of gaming offerings via interactive channels in a particular jurisdiction could, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our Gaming offerings through traditional channels in such jurisdiction. Any such adverse impact would be magnified to the extent we are not involved in, and generating revenue from, the provision of iGaming products or services in such jurisdiction.\nIn order to stay competitive in our iGaming business, we will need to continue to create, source and market game content that attracts players and invest in new and emerging technologies. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries.\nOur success depends upon our ability to adapt to, and offer products and services that keep pace with, changing technology and evolving industry standards.\nOur ability to anticipate or respond to changing technology and evolving industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services, including, but not limited to, gaming content, gaming machines, CMSs, table products and digital gaming products and services, on a timely basis or at all is a significant factor affecting our ability to remain competitive, retain existing contracts or business and expand and attract new customers and players. We cannot assure that we will achieve the necessary technological advances or have the financial resources needed to introduce new products or services on a timely basis or at all.\nIntroducing new and innovative products and services requires us to adapt and refine our manufacturing, operations and delivery capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs associated with our product innovations, or if we are unable to develop products or upgrade our production capacity in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted. In the past, we have experienced delays in launching new products and services due to the complex or innovative technologies embedded in our products and services. Such delays can adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe invest significant resources in our R&D efforts, which may not lead to successful or commercially viable new technologies, services or products.\nWe have invested, and intend to make future investments of, significant resources in R&D efforts. We invest in a number of areas, including product development for game and system-based hardware, software and game content. In addition, because of the sophistication of our newer products and the resources committed to their development, they are generally more expensive to produce and, for SciPlay and iGaming technologies, to maintain. If our new services and products do not gain market acceptance or the increase in the average selling price of these new products is not proportionate to the increase in production cost, in each case as compared to our prior products, or if the average cost of production does not go down over time, whether by reason of long-term customer acceptance, our ability to find greater efficiencies in the manufacturing process as we refine our production capabilities or a general decrease in the cost of the technology, our margins will suffer and could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot assure that our investment\nin R&D will lead to successful new technologies or products. If a new service or product is not successful, we may not recover our development, regulatory approval or promotion costs.\nOur success depends on our ability to produce new and innovative products and services that respond to customer demand and create strong and sustained player appeal.\nOur success depends upon our ability to respond to dynamic customer demand by producing new and innovative products and services. The process of developing new products and services is inherently complex and uncertain. If we fail to accurately anticipate customer needs and end user preferences through the development of new products and services, we could lose business to our competitors, which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur businesses develop and source game content both internally and through third-party suppliers. We also seek to secure third-party brands for incorporation into our game content. We believe that creative and appealing game content produces more revenue for our gaming machine customers and provides them with a competitive advantage, which in turn enhances our revenue and our ability to attract new business and to retain existing business. We cannot assure that we will be able to sustain the success of our existing game content or effectively develop or obtain from third parties game content or licensed brands that will be widely accepted both by our customers and players.\nOur success also depends on creating products and services with strong and sustained player appeal. We are under continuous pressure to anticipate player reactions to, and acceptance of, our new products, avoid declining play levels on our leased gaming machines and continue to provide successful products that generate a high level of play. In some cases, a new game or gaming machine will only be accepted by our casino or digital gaming customers if we can demonstrate that it is likely to produce more revenue and Net win and/or has more player appeal than our existing products and services or our competitors\u2019 products and services. WAP, premium and daily fee Participation gaming machines are replaced on short notice by casino operators if they do not meet and sustain revenue and profitability expectations. Customers may cancel pending orders with us if our products are not performing to expectations at other casinos.\nIn addition, the social gaming landscape is rapidly evolving and is characterized by major fluctuations in the popularity of social products and platforms, such as the dramatic increase in the popularity of mobile platforms. We may be unable to develop products at a rate necessary to respond to these changes, or at all, or that anticipate the interests of social players. Likewise, our SciPlay offerings operate largely through Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft platforms. If alternative platforms increase in popularity, we could be adversely impacted if we fail to timely create compatible versions of our products.\nCompetition is intense in the digital and social gaming landscape. The increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases the potential competition in our SciPlay and iGaming businesses, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution. As more competitors enter the market, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nOur inability to complete multiple acquisitions and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our growth or disrupt our plans and operations.\nOur growth strategy depends on our pursuit of strategic acquisitions. Our ability to succeed in implementing our acquisition strategy will depend to some degree upon our ability to identify and complete commercially viable acquisitions, including multiple acquisitions carried out simultaneously and in short time frames. We cannot assure that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire or do so within the intended timeframes. We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our acquisitions and our combined operations, including acquired assets, operations and personnel. In addition, the expected cost synergies or any other anticipated benefits associated with such acquisitions may not be fully realized in the anticipated amounts or within the contemplated timeframes or cost expectations, which could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We expect to incur incremental costs and capital expenditures related to our contemplated integration activities.\nAcquisition transactions may disrupt our ongoing business. The integration of acquisitions will require significant time and focus from management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business or delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of SciPlay being a standalone public company, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated strategic benefits expected as a result of SciPlay being a standalone public company, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits include the following:\n\u2022allowing investors to evaluate the distinct merits, performance and future prospects of the SciPlay business, independent of our other businesses\u037e\n\u2022improving the SciPlay business\u2019s strategic and operational flexibility and increasing management focus as SciPlay continues to implement its strategic plan and allowing the SciPlay business to respond more effectively to different player needs and the competitive environment for its business\u037e\n\u2022creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate the SciPlay business\u2019s ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing its capital stock\u037e and\n\u2022facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of the SciPlay business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives of the SciPlay business.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits of SciPlay being a standalone public company for a variety of reasons, and it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe consummation of the SciPlay initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in 2019 diluted our economic interest in the SciPlay business, and as a result we only benefit from a portion of any profits and growth of that business, and from any dividends and other distributions from that business, if any. We currently do not expect SciPlay to declare or pay any cash dividends, other than tax distributions and certain cash distributions related to the impact of taxes pursuant to the TRA, and therefore its operating cash flows are not available for our use other than within SciPlay. If SciPlay discontinues the payment of, or is unable to pay, such distributions to us, this will further reduce our available liquidity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, SciPlay generated 54% of our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations and 24% of our net cash provided by operating activities (including discontinued operations). Furthermore, the terms of any indebtedness incurred by SciPlay business may, and the terms of the SciPlay Revolver will, limit the ability of SciPlay business to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, or to amend the agreements between SciPlay and us and our other subsidiaries.\nWe depend on our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by an interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or a serious quality assurance lapse, including as a result of the insolvency of any of our key suppliers.\nSimilarly, the manufacture and maintenance of our gaming machines and gaming systems are dependent upon a regular and continuous supply of raw materials and components, many of which are manufactured or produced outside of the U.S. Certain of the components we use are customized for our products. The assembly of certain of our products and other hardware is performed by third parties. Any interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or services or any material quality assurance lapse with respect thereto could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may be unable to find adequate replacements for our suppliers within a reasonable time frame, on favorable commercial terms or at all. The impact of the foregoing may be magnified as we continue to seek to streamline our gaming supply chain by reducing the number of our suppliers. Further, manufacturing costs may unexpectedly increase and we may not be able to successfully recover any or all of such cost increases. Additionally, in 2021, we experienced pressures on the supply chain related to parts sourcing, which contributed to approximately $5 million of inventory obsolescence charge. Because of the use of certain shared parts in some of our gaming machines in both old and new cabinets, supply chain pressures on availability of these parts may require us to re-allocate shared parts, rendering further units obsolete if such conditions sustain for an extended period of time.\nIn all of our businesses, we rely upon a number of significant third-party suppliers and vendors delivering parts, equipment and services on schedule in order for us to meet our contractual commitments. Furthermore, we outsource the manufacturing of certain of our sub-assemblies to third parties in the U.S., Europe, Central America and Asia. The willingness of such third parties to provide their services to us may be affected by various factors. Changes in law or regulation in any jurisdiction in which we operate may make the provision of key services to us unlawful in such jurisdictions. To the extent that third parties are unwilling or unable to provide services to us, this may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial performance and prospects. Failure of these third parties to meet their delivery commitments could result in us being in breach of, and subsequently losing, the affected customer orders, which loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, cash flows and financial condition. We rely on network and/or telecommunications services for certain of our products. For instance, any disruption to our network or telecommunications could impact our linked or networked games, which could reduce our revenue.\nIn our SciPlay and iGaming businesses, we often rely on third-party data center providers to, among other things, host our remote game servers. Our SciPlay and iGaming businesses could be adversely impacted by breaches of or disruptions to these third-party data centers, including through disruptions in our RMG business, potential service level penalties with respect to our customers, reputational harm, the disclosure of proprietary information or the information of our customers or the theft of our or our customers assets, and to the extent any such data center provider was unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us.\nIn certain regions, we enter into agreements with local distributors for the distribution of our land-based gaming products to one or more customers. Changes to these distributor relationships, including modification or termination of our agreements or difficulties with any such distributor could prevent us from delivering products or services to our customers on a timely basis, or at all, and could negatively impact our business. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and any resulting unfavorable social, political and economic conditions have negatively impacted our suppliers and contract manufacturers in varied ways in different communities, which could lead to interruption or cessation of services provided to us. For more information on the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19, see the risk factor captioned \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, continue to and, in the future, could significantly impact our operations and, should negative impacts such as significant player engagement develop, adversely affect and continue to adversely affect our operations, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\u201d\nOur SciPlay business largely depends upon our relationships with key third-party platform providers, who we rely on to make our games available to players and to collect revenue, and changes in those relationships could negatively impact our SciPlay business.\nIn our SciPlay business, our services operate largely through Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon platforms, with some games available on the Microsoft platform, which also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our games. Substantially all of our SciPlay revenue is generated by players using those platforms. Consequently, our expansion and prospects of our SciPlay offerings depend on our continued relationships with these providers, and any emerging platform providers that are widely adopted by our target player base. Our relationships with Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are not governed by contracts but rather by these platform providers\u2019 standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platforms, and which the platform providers can change unilaterally on short or without notice. Version updates, such as Apple's iOS 14.5 update in April 2021 which included changes to its AppTracking Transparency policy and now requires user permission before developers can track a user across apps and websites owned by other companies or access a user\u2019s device\u2019s advertising identifier, which has reduced the quantity and quality of data available to us. These changes could, among other things, have a detrimental impact on our ability to conduct targeted advertising on platforms, increase the cost to obtain new users and impact the return on investment of advertising spend. Our SciPlay business will also be adversely impacted if we are unable to continue these relationships in the future or if the terms and conditions offered by these providers are altered to our disadvantage. For instance, if any of these providers were to increase their fees, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would suffer.\nIn addition, our SciPlay business would be harmed if:\n\u2022these platform providers discontinue or limit our access to their platforms;\n\u2022governments or private parties, such as internet providers, impose bandwidth restrictions or increase charges or restrict or prohibit access to those platforms;\n\u2022these platforms decline in popularity;\n\u2022these platforms modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service or other policies, including fees;\n\u2022these platforms impose restrictions or make it more difficult for players to buy coins, chips and cards; or\n\u2022these platforms change how the personal information of players is made available to developers or develop their own competitive offerings.\nIf alternative platforms increase in popularity, we could be adversely impacted if we fail to create compatible versions of our games in a timely manner, or if we fail to establish a relationship with such alternative platforms. Likewise, if our platform providers alter their operating platforms, we could be adversely impacted as our offerings may not be compatible with\nthe altered platforms or may require significant and costly modifications in order to become compatible. If our platform providers were to develop competitive offerings, either on their own or in cooperation with one or more competitors, our growth prospects could be negatively impacted. If our platform providers do not perform these functions in accordance with our platform agreements, we could be adversely impacted.\nIn the past, some of these platform providers have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their features that permit our players to purchase coins, chips and cards. For example, in the second and third quarters of 2018, we were negatively impacted by data privacy protection changes implemented by Facebook, which impaired our players\u2019 ability to access their previously acquired coins, chips and cards and purchase additional coins, chips and cards. If similar events recur on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact players\u2019 ability to download our games, access social features or purchase coins, chips and cards, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, operating results and brand.\nOur future results of operations may be negatively impacted by ownership changes and consolidation in the gaming industry, including by casino operators.\nAs repeat customers represent a substantial part of our Gaming business revenue, our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be negatively affected if our casino customers are sold to or merge with other entities. Such entities may purchase more products and services from our competitors, reduce spending on our products or cause downward pricing pressures. Consolidation among casino operators could result in order cancellations or a slowing in the replacement cycle for existing gaming machines, or could require our current customers to purchase our competitors\u2019 products, any of which could negatively impact our Gaming business.\nOur results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance.\nOur results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally strongest in the spring and summer. Player activity for our SciPlay business is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. Certain other seasonal trends and factors that may cause our results to fluctuate include: the geographies where we operate; holiday and vacation seasons; climate; weather; economic and political conditions; timing of the release of new products; significant equipment sales or the introduction of gaming activities in new jurisdictions or to new customers; and other factors.\nIn light of the foregoing, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in another quarter or for the full fiscal year. We cannot assure that the seasonal trends and other factors that have impacted our historical results will repeat in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nRisks Relating to our Technology\nOur success depends on the security and integrity of the systems and products we offer, and security breaches or other disruptions could compromise our information or the information of our customers and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe believe that our success depends, in large part, on providing secure products, services and systems to our customers, and on our ability to avoid, detect, replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our products and services. Our businesses sometimes involve the storage, processing and transmission of players\u2019 proprietary, confidential and personal information. We also maintain certain other proprietary and confidential information relating to our business and personal information of our personnel. All of our products and services are designed with security features to prevent fraudulent activity. However, we cannot guarantee that these security features will effectively stop all fraudulent activities. Despite our security measures, our products, services and systems are vulnerable to attacks by hackers, customers, retailers, vendors or employees or breached due to malfeasance or other disruptions. Any security breach or incident that we experience could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of our or our players\u2019 data, the loss, corruption or alteration of this data, interruptions in our operations or damage to our computers or systems or those of our players or third-party platforms. Any of these could expose us to claims, litigation, fines and potential liability. Our ability to prevent anomalies and monitor and ensure the quality and integrity of our products and services is periodically reviewed and enhanced, but may not be sufficient to prevent future attacks, breaches or disruptions. Similarly, we regularly assess the adequacy of our security systems, including the security of our games and software, to protect against any material loss to any of our customers and our players, as well as the integrity of our products and services to end users and the integrity of our games to players. Expanded use of the internet and other interactive technologies may result in increased security risks for us and our customers. We cannot assure that our business or a business we acquire will not be or has not been affected by fraudulent activities or a security breach or lapse, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOnline transactions may be subject to sophisticated schemes to defraud, launder money or other illegal activities. There is a risk that our products or systems may be used for those purposes by our customers\u2019 players. There is also a risk that we will be subject to fraudulent activities by our employees. In addition, our gaming machines have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past. Games and gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations, or they may be shut down by regulators. The occurrence of anomalies in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our gaming machines or our other products and services (including our SciPlay and iGaming products and services), may give rise to claims from players or customers, may lead to claims for lost revenue and profits and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by regulatory authorities, including suspension or revocation of our licenses or other disciplinary action. Additionally, in the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our products and services, substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nAn increasing number of online services have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their services. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of a business we acquire, occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and brand, or the security measures and brand of a business we acquire, could be harmed, and we could lose players. Data security breaches and other data security incidents may also result from non-technical means, for example, actions by employees or contractors. Any compromise of our security, or the security of a business we acquire, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability that is not always limited to the amounts covered by our insurance. Any such compromise could also result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures. Any of these effects could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on protecting our intellectual property in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our intellectual property includes certain patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to our products and services (including gaming machines, digital gaming products, table games, shufflers and accessories, and gaming systems), and proprietary or confidential information that is not subject to patent or similar protection. Our success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain protection for the trademarks, trade dress, names, logos or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright and patent protection for our proprietary technologies, designs, software and innovations. We cannot assure that we will be able to build and maintain consumer value in our trademarks, obtain patent, trademark or copyright protection or that any patent, trademark or copyright will provide us with competitive advantages. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court recently tightened the standard for patent eligibility of software patents. Despite revised U.S. Patent and Trademark Office guidelines in 2019, similar decisions in the future may negatively impact the validity or enforceability of certain of our patents, our ability to protect our inventions, innovations and new technology and the value of our substantial patent portfolio. Under a patent cross-licensing agreement with IGT, which relates to technology that is used in substantially all of our gaming machines, we can offer games using patented game features from the patent portfolios of other members of IGT\u2019s slot game features program, and such members can likewise offer games using patented game features from our patent portfolio. This arrangement may diminish the competitive advantage our slot games may derive from our patents.\nOur intellectual property protects the integrity of our games, systems, products and services. Competitors may independently develop similar or superior products, software or systems, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In cases where our technology or product is not protected by enforceable intellectual property rights, such independent development may result in a significant diminution in the value of such technology or product.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and independent contractors regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information, but we cannot assure that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information will be honored.\nWe are currently making, and in the future may make, claims of infringement, invalidity or enforceability against third parties. For example, with the emergence of digital gaming, we have increased enforcement against parties that infringe our intellectual property.\nThis enforcement could:\n\u2022cause us to incur greater costs and expenses in the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022potentially negatively impact our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022cause one or more of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property interests to be ruled or rendered unenforceable or invalid; or\n\u2022divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nWe rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties, including from our competitors, for use in our Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming businesses. Substantially all of our gaming machines and portions of our SciPlay and iGaming offerings and services use intellectual property licensed from third parties. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market. We cannot assure that these third-party licenses, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot renew and/or expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property.\nSome of our license agreements contain minimum guaranteed royalty payments to the third party. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to offset the minimum guaranteed royalty payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our license agreements typically contain restrictions on our ability to use or transfer the licensed rights in connection with certain strategic transactions. Certain of our license agreements grant the licensor rights to audit our use of the licensor\u2019s intellectual property. Disputes with licensors over uses or terms could result in the payment of additional royalties or penalties by us, cancellation or non-renewal of the underlying license or litigation.\nThe regulatory review process and licensing requirements also may preclude us from using technologies owned or developed by third parties if those parties are unwilling to subject themselves to regulatory review or do not meet regulatory requirements. Some gaming authorities require gaming manufacturers to obtain approval before engaging in certain transactions, such as acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations, financings, stock offerings and share repurchases. Obtaining such approvals can be costly and time consuming, and we cannot assure that such approvals will be granted or that the approval process will not result in delays or disruptions to our strategic objectives.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems, and any failures in our systems or errors, defects or disruptions in our products and services could diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability and have disrupted and could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results.\nWe rely on information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These third parties are typically under no obligation to renew agreements and there is no guarantee that we will be able to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage and support our business operations and to maintain internal control over our financial reporting. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading current systems and preventing security breaches. Among other things, our systems are susceptible to damage, outages, disruptions or shutdowns due to fire, floods, power loss, break-ins, cyber-attacks, network penetration, denial of service attacks and similar events. While we have and will continue to implement network security measures and data protection safeguards, our servers and other computer systems are vulnerable to any number of threats, including viruses, malicious software, hacking, break-ins or theft, data privacy or security breaches, third-party security breaches, employee error or malfeasance and similar events. Failures in our systems or services or unauthorized access to or tampering with our systems and databases could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any failures in our computer systems or telecommunications services could affect our ability to operate our linked games or otherwise conduct business.\nA meaningful portion of our SciPlay and iGaming gaming traffic is hosted by third-party data centers, such as Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Continent 8 and Claranet. Such third parties provide us with computing and storage capacity, and are under no obligation to renew the agreements related to these services with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities and we may incur significant costs and possible lengthy service interruptions in connection with doing so, potentially causing harm to our reputation. If a game is unavailable or operates more slowly than anticipated when a player attempts to access it, that player may stop playing the game and be less likely to return to the game.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure, including those operated by third parties, have and may again experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. We have no control over third parties that provide services to us and those parties could suffer problems or make decisions adverse to our business. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events. However, such disruptions could materially and adversely impact our ability to deliver products or services to customers and interrupt other processes. For example, in 2019, Flash was removed from the Google Chrome browser, resulting in player friction and disruptions in delivering our SciPlay and iGaming services to our customers. If our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time, to key decision makers, the ability to manage our business could be disrupted and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSeveral of our products and services rely on data transferred over the internet. Access to the internet in a timely fashion is necessary to provide a satisfactory user experience to the consumers of our products. Third parties, such as telecommunications companies, could prevent access to the internet or limit the speed of our data transmissions, with or without reason, causing an adverse impact on our user experience that may materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, telecommunications companies may implement certain measures, such as increased cost or restrictions based on the type or amount of data transmitted, that would impact consumers\u2019 ability to access our products, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, internet penetration may be adversely affected by difficult global economic conditions or the cancellation of government programs to expand broadband access.\nIf we or a company we acquire sustains cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, regulatory fines or punishment and other negative consequences.\nOur information technology systems and infrastructure are subject to cyber-attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, theft, computer hacking, employee error or malfeasance or other security breaches. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Threats to our information technology systems and infrastructure include:\n\u2022experienced computer programmers and hackers who are able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns or who are able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities;\n\u2022security incidents, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and the data stored on those systems, and the data of our business partners;\n\u2022third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, are also a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. Although we have insurance coverage for protecting against damages resulting from cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our insurance coverage for protecting against damages resulting from cyber-attacks does not cover incidents which occur at companies we acquire after such cyber-attack. As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed U.S. and non- U.S. laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection. In addition, our customers may encourage, or require, compliance with certain security standards, such as the voluntary cybersecurity framework released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which consists of controls designed to identify and manage cyber-security risks, and we could be negatively impacted to the extent we are unable to comply with such standards.\nThe intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products and services, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies. If technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others, including our competitors, we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies. If the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies, our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure that our business activities, games, products, services and systems will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us. In addition to infringement claims, third parties may allege claims of invalidity or unenforceability against us or against our licensees or manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology. A successful challenge to, or invalidation of, one of our intellectual property interests, a successful claim of infringement by a third party against us, our products or services, or one of our licensees in connection with the use of our technologies, or an unsuccessful claim of infringement made by us against a third party or its products or services could adversely affect our business or cause us financial harm. Any such claim and any resulting litigation, should it occur, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time consuming to defend or require us to pay significant amounts in damages;\n\u2022invalidate our proprietary rights;\n\u2022cause us to cease making, licensing or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products or services or limit our ability to bring new products and services to the market in the future;\n\u2022require us to enter into costly or burdensome royalty, licensing or settlement agreements in order to obtain the right to use a product, process or component;\n\u2022impact the commercial viability of the products and services that are the subject of the claim during the pendency of such claim; and/or\n\u2022require us by way of injunction to remove products or services on lease or stop selling or leasing new products or services.\nFailure of our technological blocking systems could result in violations of laws or regulations and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and prospects.\nThere is no guarantee that the technical blocks we implement and which our customers implement will be effective. These systems and controls are intended to ensure that our customers do not accept bets from end-users located in those jurisdictions where we have made a decision not to offer all or certain of our products and services. Any failure of such systems and controls may result in violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any claims in respect of any such violations could have cost, resource, and, in particular if successful, reputational implications, and implications on our ability to retain, renew or expand our portfolio of licenses, and so have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and prospects.\nMoreover, there is an additional, ongoing risk that the current list of jurisdictions from which our customers and the Company must block access is enlarged, as there is a possibility that regulators who grant licenses to customers and/or the Company will require the blocking of specific additional jurisdictions. Similarly, jurisdictions may update their laws or regulations in such a way as to render the supply of gaming services into that jurisdiction legally or commercially unsustainable. In all such circumstances, additional blocking activity may have a detrimental effect on our financial position.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our global enterprise resource planning system conversion, it could disrupt our business or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year conversion from certain legacy ERP systems to our primary global ERP system. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information on our operations to management. Our ERP system migration will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. There are inherent risks associated with upgrading or changing systems, including inaccurate data or reporting. The process of upgrading and standardizing our ERP system is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Although we believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate these risks through, among other things, testing, training and staging implementations, we cannot assure that we will not experience data loss, disruptions, delays or negative business impacts from the upgrades. Any\noperational disruptions during the course of this process and any delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system or in the performance of our legacy systems could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses. Additionally, while we have spent considerable efforts to plan and budget for the implementation of the new ERP system, changes in scope, timeline or cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Political or Other Regulatory Risks\nThe provisions of our bylaws requiring exclusive forum in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, administrative or investigative or that assert any claim or counterclaim (i) brought in our name or right or on our behalf, (ii) asserting a claim for breach of any fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Nevada Revised Statutes (\u201cNRS\u201d), Chapters 78 or 92A or any provision of our articles of incorporation or our bylaws or (iv) asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws further provide that, in the event that the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada does not have jurisdiction over any such action, suit or proceeding, then any other state district court located in the State of Nevada will be the sole and exclusive forum therefor and in the event that no state district court in the State of Nevada has jurisdiction over any such action, suit or proceeding, then a federal court located within the State of Nevada will be the sole and exclusive forum therefor. Application of the choice of forum provisions may be limited in some instances by law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent our bylaws restrict the courts in which claims arising under the federal securities laws may be brought, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision and we note that our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAlthough we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Nevada law in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, these provisions may have the effect of increasing the costs to bring a claim, and limiting a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors and officers. This may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 articles of incorporation and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe and our industries are subject to strict government regulations that may limit our existing operations, have an adverse impact on our ability to grow and affect our license eligibility or expose us to fines or other penalties.\nIn the U.S. and many other countries, the provision of Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming products and services is subject to extensive and evolving regulation. These regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Therefore, we are subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed or operate. Most jurisdictions require that we be licensed, that our key personnel and certain of our security holders be found suitable or be licensed, and that our products be reviewed and approved before placement. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned. If a license, approval or finding of suitability is required by a regulatory authority and we fail to seek or do not receive the necessary approval, license or finding of suitability, or if it is granted and subsequently revoked, then we may be prohibited from providing our products or services for use in the particular jurisdiction. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license, or affect our eligibility for a license, in other jurisdictions. We may also become subject to regulation in any new jurisdictions in which we decide to operate in the future, including due to expansion of a customer\u2019s operations. Gaming authorities have levied and may levy fines against us or seize certain of our assets if we violate gaming regulations. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses or approvals or that the licensing process will not result in delays or adversely affect our operations. The failure to obtain or retain a required license or approval in any jurisdiction would decrease the geographic areas where we are permitted to operate and generate revenue, may limit our ability to obtain a license in other jurisdictions and may put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nWe cannot assure that authorities will not seek to restrict our business in their jurisdictions or institute enforcement proceedings against us. We cannot assure that any instituted enforcement proceedings will be favorably resolved, or that such proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain and renew existing licenses or to obtain new licenses in other jurisdictions. Our reputation may also be damaged by any legal or regulatory investigation, regardless of whether or not we are ultimately accused of, or found to have committed, any violation.\nOften, our games, Gaming product hardware and software and our iGaming RMG must be approved in the jurisdictions in which they are operated, and we cannot assure you that such products or services will be approved in any jurisdiction. Our networked gaming technology requires regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to the shipment or implementation of any gaming machines, products or services and, although we have received approvals from the jurisdictions in which we currently operate this technology, we cannot assure that we will receive the approvals necessary to offer it in additional gaming jurisdictions. Many of our customers are required to be licensed, and delays in approvals of our customers\u2019 operations or expansions may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, current regulations in a number of jurisdictions where our customers operate, such as Macau SAR and Singapore, limit the amount of space allocated to our products or limit the amount of new product available to operators to an amount that has been pre-approved by regulators. Substantial changes in any such regulations could adversely affect demand for our products.\nA substantial portion of our U.K. Gaming reporting unit revenue is concentrated with Ladbrokes Coral Group (which was acquired by Entain (formerly GVC Holdings PLC) in March 2018), which operates LBOs in the U.K. Effective as of April 1, 2019, fixed-odds betting terminals maximum stakes limit was required to be reduced from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. As a result of this change, a number of LBO operators commenced a rationalization of their retail operations, which among other measures has included closure of certain LBO shops. The rationalization is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\nEffective as of April 14, 2020, the U.K. Gambling Commission banned gambling businesses from allowing consumers in Great Britain to use credit cards to gamble in all online and offline gambling products, with the exception of non-remote lotteries. The U.K. Gambling Commission announced changes to license conditions, effective as of March 31, 2020, which required all online gambling operators to participate in a multi-operator self-exclusion scheme, GAMSTOP, which allowed consumers to self-exclude from online operators with one request. We will continue to monitor the impact of the ban and the changes to license conditions on our iGaming and Gaming business segments and overall business, but believe the impact will continue to be immaterial. The U.K. government\u2019s review of the U.K.\u2019s Gambling Act 2005 and anticipated increased regulatory scrutiny as a result could negatively affect our ability to operate in the U.K.\nWe and certain of our affiliates, major stockholders (generally persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically 5% or more) of our equity securities), directors, officers and key employees are subject to extensive background investigations and suitability standards in our businesses. For additional details regarding the background investigations, the risk of failure of any such individuals or entities to submit to such background investigations, the significant approval and licensing discretion of regulatory authorities, and the authority granted to these regulatory authorities, see \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibit 99.5 \u201cGaming Regulations.\u201d Our failure, or the failure of any of our major stockholders, directors, officers, key employees, products or technology, to obtain or retain a required license or approval in one jurisdiction could negatively impact our ability (or the ability of any of our major stockholders, directors, officers, key employees, products or technology) to obtain or retain required licenses and approvals in other jurisdictions.\nIn light of these regulations and the potential impact on our business, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws allow for the restriction of stock ownership by persons or entities who fail to comply with informational or other regulatory requirements under applicable gaming laws, who are found unsuitable to hold our stock by gaming authorities, whose stock ownership adversely affects our ability to obtain, maintain, renew or qualify for a license, contract, franchise or other regulatory approval from a gaming authority or a purported transferee of a stockholder who acquires shares made invalid pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. The licensing procedures and background investigations of the authorities that regulate our businesses and the restriction in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit potential investors from becoming significant stockholders or inhibit existing stockholders from retaining or increasing their ownership.\nThere are instances where a state in which a Native American tribe conducts Class III gaming activities disagrees with such tribe regarding the regulation of gaming, including the regulation of gaming suppliers. In those instances, we make every effort to comply with both state and tribal regulation and fulfill our contractual obligations. However, there may be and have been situations where any such disagreement impedes or creates uncertainty with respect to our ability to supply gaming products and services to such tribal customer or otherwise negatively impacts our relationship with such customer or gaming regulators. There are additional complexities that may impact disputes or other interactions with Native American tribe customers. For example, Native American tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits, similar to the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the individual states and the U.S. In addition, certain commercial agreements with Native American tribes\nare subject to review by regulatory authorities such as the National Indian Gaming Commission, and, among other things, any such review could require substantial modifications to any such agreement we enter into with a Native American tribe customer.\nOur customers are required to comply with all applicable laws. In addition, we maintain and update a list of jurisdictions where we believe there is legal or regulatory risk associated with remote gaming and require that our customers contractually agree not to offer our games or accept wagers from end users in such jurisdictions. Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that our customers will remain in compliance with laws or with the terms of their contracts with us or that a breach of any of the foregoing will be identified or cured in a timely manner.\nWe have developed and implemented an internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming activities and legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. Refer to \u201cGovernment Regulation - General\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details about the compliance program. We cannot assure that such steps will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine, suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses or other penalties.\nLaws and regulations relating to our SciPlay and iGaming businesses are evolving. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the evolving regulatory landscape for digital gaming, see the risk factors captioned \u201cWe may not be able to capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of digital gaming or other trends and changes in the gaming, lottery, social, and iGaming industries, including due to laws and regulations governing these industries\u201d; \u201cLegislative interpretation and enforcement of certain gaming activities could adversely affect financial performance and reputation\u201d; \u201cRegulators and investors may perceive gaming suppliers and operators similarly, and consider their respective regulatory risk to be similar\u201d; \u201cFailure of our technological blocking systems could result in violations of laws or regulations and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and prospects\u201d; \u201cExpectations of a shift to regulated digital gaming may not come to fruition\u201d; \u201cWe may incur additional impairment charges\u201d; and \u201cWe rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of third parties\u201d; and \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Exhibit 99.5 \u201cGaming Regulations\u201d for additional information regarding certain of the regulations that govern our Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming businesses.\nLegislative interpretation and enforcement of certain gaming activities could adversely affect financial performance and reputation.\nSome jurisdictions are seeking to regulate gaming; others are seeking to prohibit it. We generate a portion of our operating results through licensing our proprietary software technology and games to enable gaming operators to provide gaming services to customers where such services are dependent on that software and the functionality it provides. Laws and regulations relating to the supply of such services are complex, inconsistent and evolving, and we may be subject to such laws either directly through explicit service provision or indirectly insofar as we have assisted the supply to customers who are themselves subject to such laws. For example, where supply by the Company to the customer is critical to the gaming transaction, there is a risk that a regulator could take direct enforcement action against us.\nMany jurisdictions have not updated their laws to address the supply of remote gaming, which by its nature is a multi-jurisdictional activity. Moreover, the legality of such activities and related services is subject to uncertainties arising from differing approaches by legislatures, regulators and enforcement agents including in relation to determining in which jurisdiction the gaming takes place and therefore which law applies and in relation to regulations being interpreted in unfavorable or unanticipated ways.\nWe monitor legal and regulatory developments in all of our material gaming markets and generally seek to keep abreast of legal and regulatory developments affecting our industries. However, we do not necessarily monitor, on a continuous basis, the laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we or our customers do business and, therefore, we or our customers may operate in jurisdictions where we may be unaware of the full extent of the legal or regulatory risk.\nSometimes we are able to take the additional precautionary step of blocking wagers from jurisdictions where we are aware of material legal or regulatory risk associated with remote gaming. In addition, the Company protects itself through contractual mechanisms with our customers explicitly allowing us to suspend or terminate services if such customers offer our games or accept wagers from end users in certain jurisdictions.\nDespite the monitoring we have undertaken and the other precautions we take, it is possible that, due to the above factors, such measures are not sufficient and that criminal or regulatory actions could be brought against us or our employees or directors, any or all of which could have a detrimental effect on the our financial performance and reputation. Furthermore,\nactions brought against our customers could also have a detrimental effect on our financial performance or reputation, including if such actions prevent or delay the receipt of revenue from such customers.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of digital gaming or other trends and changes in the industries in which we operate, including due to laws and regulations governing these industries.\nWe participate in the new and evolving digital gaming industries through our SciPlay and iGaming offerings. Part of our strategy is to take advantage of the liberalization of digital gaming, both within the U.S. and internationally. These industries involve significant risks and uncertainties, including legal, business and financial risks. The success of these industries and of our digital gaming products and services may be affected by future developments in social networks, including Facebook, mobile platforms, regulatory developments, data privacy laws and other factors that we are unable to predict and are beyond our control. This fast-changing environment can make it difficult to plan strategically and can provide opportunities for competitors to grow their businesses at our expense. Consequently, our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition relating to our products and services are difficult to predict and may not grow at the rates we expect, and we cannot assure that these products and services will be successful in the long term.\nThere are still significant forces working to limit or prohibit digital gaming in the U.S. For additional information regarding proposed laws at the federal or state level, see \u201cGovernment Regulation - iGaming\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The enactment of digital gaming legislation that federalizes significant aspects of the regulation of digital gaming and/or limits the forms of internet wagering that are permissible at the state or federal level could have an adverse impact on our ability to pursue our digital gaming strategy in the U.S.\nInternationally, laws relating to digital gaming are evolving, particularly in Europe. For additional information, including steps taken by European governments, the European Commission dropping enforcement actions, and regulatory developments in countries outside Europe and the U.S., regarding how laws relating to digital gaming are evolving internationally, see \u201cGovernment Regulation - iGaming\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any such state, federal or foreign laws and regulations, or the extent to which any such laws and regulations will facilitate or hinder our interactive strategy.\nOur business is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, and laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer data. The scope of data privacy and security regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely within the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Our SciPlay and iGaming businesses are subject to evolving regulations, and the status of any particular jurisdiction may change at any time. The regulatory structure surrounding certain aspects of these businesses is currently in flux in some jurisdictions. See the risk factor captioned \u201cGaming opponents persist in their efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming, which, if successful, could limit the growth of our operations\u201d and \u201cGovernment Regulation - SciPlay\u201d and \u201cGovernment Regulation - iGaming\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on evolving regulations applicable to our SciPlay and iGaming businesses.\nKnow-your-customer and geo-location programs and technologies supplied by third parties are an important aspect of certain internet and mobile gaming products and services because they confirm certain information with respect to players and prospective players, such as age, identity and location. Payment processing programs and technologies, typically provided by third parties, are also a necessary feature of interactive wagering products and services. These programs and technologies are costly and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, we cannot assure that products containing these programs and technologies will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they will perform accurately or otherwise in accordance with our required specifications. See the SciPlay and iGaming sections in the risk factor captioned \u201cWe operate in highly competitive industries, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses\u201d for additional information on risks regarding internet and mobile gaming products and services.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of our tax positions, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax benefits that we intend to eventually derive could be undermined due to changing tax laws. In addition, the taxing authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business regularly examine our income and other tax returns and we expect that they may examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty.\nCertain of our U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax attributes may be subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) (or comparable provisions of state or foreign law) in the event that certain changes in ownership were to occur. Tax attributes that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as carry forwards until they expire and can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryover period subject to the limitation in each year. Given the Company\u2019s significant U.S. tax attributes, we continuously monitor potential ownership changes under Section 382. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced an ownership change, triggering the application of Section 382. We do not expect any resulting Section 382 limitations to have a significant impact on the use of our tax attributes.\nGaming opponents persist in their efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming, which, if successful, could limit the growth of our operations.\nThere is significant debate over, and opposition to, land-based and interactive RMG. We cannot assure that this opposition will not succeed in preventing the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is presently prohibited, prohibiting or limiting the expansion of gaming where it is currently permitted or causing the repeal of legalized gaming in any jurisdiction. Any successful effort to curtail the expansion of, or limit or prohibit, legalized gaming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, there is significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social and digital gaming, including social casino gaming. Some states or countries have anti-gaming groups that specifically target social casino games. Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern interactive social gaming, social casino games specifically. These could result in a prohibition on interactive social gaming, or social casino gaming altogether, restrict our ability to advertise our games, or substantially increase our costs to comply with these regulations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign legislation or regulations relating to our SciPlay and iGaming businesses or the extent to which they may affect our SciPlay and iGaming businesses.\nExpectations of a shift to regulated digital gaming may not come to fruition.\nOur business strategy includes a gradual shift into new, regulated digital gaming markets. We expect there to be an opportunity to grow revenue by being among the first systems providers to obtain a license to operate digital gaming systems in markets where end-users historically have been reliant on unregulated digital gaming. However, there is no guarantee that end users who are currently engaging in unregulated digital gaming (in the U.S. or elsewhere) will transition away from unregulated gaming to regulated gaming in the wake of regulation, which is itself uncertain as to timing and scope and varies on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Our ability to influence end-user tastes and habits is limited, and if the introduction of regulation fails to result in a migration of end-users from unregulated gaming to regulated gaming (from which we currently derive and are expected to derive revenue through revenue sharing and fixed fees arrangements with our sports wagering customers), this may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial performance and prospects.\nData privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business could increase the cost of our operations and subject us to possible sanctions and other penalties\nWe collect, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. Our businesses are therefore subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data. Such laws and regulations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules. In particular, the EU has adopted strict data privacy and security regulations. Following certain developments in the EU, including the EU\u2019s GDPR and proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d), data privacy and security compliance in the EU are increasingly complex and challenging. The GDPR created new compliance obligations applicable to our business and some of our players and it also imposes increased financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious violations). Compliance with the GDPR and similar regulations increases our operational costs and can impact operational efficiencies.\nThe scope of data privacy and security regulations worldwide continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely within the U.S. and other jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020. This law, among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers, imposes new rules for collecting or using information about minors, and affords consumers new abilities to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information. It is unclear how courts will interpret the CCPA. The U.S. Congress may also pass a law to preempt all or part of the CCPA. Further, California recently passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which amends the CCPA to provide more comprehensive privacy protections to consumers once it becomes effective in January 2023. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA may be significant, and the CCPA required us to\nupdate our policies to include CCPA-specific clauses and procedures. A number of other proposals related to data privacy or security are pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union is contemplating the adoption of the ePrivacy Regulation, expected in 2021, that would govern data privacy and the protection of personal data in electronic communications, in particular for direct marketing purposes. Efforts to comply with these and other data privacy and security restrictions that may be enacted could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and increase the cost of our operations. Failure to comply with such restrictions could subject us to criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. In part due to the uncertainty of the legal climate, complying with regulations, and any applicable rules or guidance from self-regulatory organizations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection, may result in substantial costs and may necessitate changes to our businesses practices, which may compromise our growth strategy, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain players, and otherwise adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to players or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our players to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and businesses. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our games. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations, or agreements, such violations may put our players\u2019 data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our players to lose trust in us and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and businesses. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if unrelated to our businesses, industry or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring costs, the benefits of which are unpredictable and may not be achieved.\nIn the past, we have implemented various business improvement, optimization and restructuring initiatives in an effort to streamline our organization, leverage our resources more efficiently, and reduce our operating costs. These initiatives encompassed a combination of headcount reductions, facilities streamlining, and reductions in other operating costs. Most recently, we have incurred and expect to incur additional restructuring costs related to the divestitures of our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses. We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in similar or additional future restructuring initiatives. Because we are not able to predict with certainty when we will reorganize portions of our business, we cannot predict the extent, timing and magnitude of additional restructuring charges. We may also not realize the anticipated reduction in operating costs.\nWe may incur additional impairment charges.\nWe review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill assets for impairment at least annually. Factors that may indicate a change in circumstances, such that the carrying value of our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other non-amortizing assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting unfavorable social, political, economic and financial conditions, during the first quarter of 2020 we performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment, which resulted in a $54 million goodwill impairment charge for our U.K. Gaming reporting unit further discussed below. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2021 for our U.K. Gaming reporting unit indicated that its fair value was substantially in excess (greater than 20%) of the carrying value and for all other reporting units, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. However, this could change in the future depending on prevailing conditions that could result in additional impairment charges. For more information on the assessment and the goodwill impairment charge, see section captioned \u201cBusiness Overview - Highlights, including recent developments - Impacts of COVID-19 on Business Operations, Financial Results and Liquidity\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 11.\nAs discussed above and further detailed in Note 11, the COVID-19 disruptions resulted in the widespread closures of LBO shops across the U.K., which, along with global economic uncertainty, contributed to further deterioration in business\nconditions from our 2019 annual goodwill test date, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $54 million during the first quarter of 2020. While our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2021 indicated that the carrying value of our U.K. Gaming reporting is not in excess than that of its estimated fair value, future adverse changes to our projections, could negatively impact the recoverability of the remaining carrying value of our goodwill and other assets for our U.K. Gaming reporting unit, which might result in additional material impairment charges. The remaining goodwill balance for our U.K. Gaming reporting unit as of December 31, 2021 was $127 million.\nMoreover, application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We cannot predict the occurrence of impairments, and we cannot assure that we will not have to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and as a result of corporate-wide rebranding, we determined that useful life for certain of our indefinite-lived and finite-lived trade names in our Gaming business segment warrant a change. We first performed an impairment assessment, which indicated that carrying values of these trade names are recoverable (or for our indefinite-lived assets, the estimated fair value was more likely than not in-excess of the carrying value). The change in useful life determination was treated as a change in estimate with a $109 million carrying value of these legacy trade names being amortized on a straight-line basis over a twenty-month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, which materially approximates the expected pattern of use over their remaining useful lives and periods over which these legacy trade names will contribute to the future cash flows of the respective asset groups. The incremental expense of this change for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10 million and is recorded in D&A. However, this could change in the future depending on prevailing conditions that could result in impairment charges. Such charges could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on our key employees and rely on skilled employees with creative and technical backgrounds.\nWe depend on the continued performance of our executive officers and key personnel, including Barry Cottle, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our ability to retain certain key employees and skilled technical workers has been and may continue to be impaired due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we lose the services of any of our executive officers or key personnel and cannot find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner, it could have an adverse impact on our business. Our ability to expand is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain talented employees in the U.S. and internationally who are capable of leading our employees to achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe also rely on our highly skilled, technically trained and creative employees to develop new technologies and create innovative products. Such employees, particularly game designers, engineers and project managers with desirable skill sets are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. 2021, in particular, was marked by a labor shortage that made, and continues to make, hiring and retaining skilled employees to support our products highly competitive. A lack of skilled technical workers could delay or negatively impact our business plans, ability to compete, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting, it could adversely affect our reputation and business.\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or when necessary implement new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we may suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, the inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud, regardless of the adequacy of those controls. We are currently undertaking an ERP system implementation in our largest business segment. In addition, the adoption of any new accounting standards may require us to add new or change existing internal controls, which may not be successful. Each of the preceding changes could materially impact our internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2021, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria outlined in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, however, we cannot assure that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be affected by severe weather and other geological events in the locations where we or our customers, suppliers or regulators operate.\nWe may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or tsunamis, that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, data service providers and regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers\u2019 facilities, such as Amazon Web Services, Apple,\nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft may impair or delay the operation, development, provisions or delivery of our products and services. Additionally, disruptions experienced by our regulators due to natural disasters or otherwise could delay our introduction of new products or entry into new jurisdictions where regulatory approval is necessary. While we insure against certain business interruption risks, we cannot assure that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. Any serious disruption to our operations, or those of our customers, our suppliers, data service providers, or our regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation, including the perception held by our customers, business partners and other key stakeholders. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, sustainability and social responsibility. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention, our corporate culture and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could incur costs in the event of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, which may adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations and real property are subject to U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur costs, including cleanup costs, fines or penalties, and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, which could negatively impact our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent or reduce environmental pollution, and these permits are subject to review, renewal and modification by issuing authorities.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are and may become subject to litigation claims in the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, with respect to employee matters, alleged product and system malfunctions, alleged intellectual property infringement and claims relating to our contracts, licenses and strategic investments. We have incurred and may incur significant expense defending or settling any such litigation. Additionally, adverse judgments that have been and may be decided against us resulted and could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, as as described more fully in Note 20 below, on April 17, 2018, a plaintiff, Sheryl Fife, filed a putative class action complaint, Fife v. Scientific Games Corporation, against SGC in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. On November 23, 2021, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the lawsuit for the amount of $24.5 million. On January 18, 2022, the parties executed a settlement agreement, and plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the parties\u2019 proposed settlement. On January 19, 2022, the district court granted preliminary approval to the parties\u2019 proposed settlement, and scheduled a hearing for final approval of the settlement on June 23, 2022. Although the case was brought against Scientific Games, pursuant to the Intercompany Services Agreement, we expect SciPlay to cover or contribute to the settlement amount due to the matter arising as a result of our business. But if SciPlay is unable to cover or contribute to the settlement amount, we may incur the full expense of the settlement amount. For additional information regarding our litigation, see Note 20.\nFailure to perform under our contracts may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages and contract termination.\nOur contracts, including our Gaming contracts relating to the provision of VLTs, typically permit a counterparty to terminate the contract at any time for a material failure to perform, other specified reasons and, in many cases, for no reason at all. Upon such a termination or failure to perform, we may be required to refund fees paid to us for services performed or allow our customers to return our products to us for a full refund. In the past, we have paid or incurred liquidated damages and have been required to allow the return of VLTs for a full refund under our contracts, and material amounts of liquidated damages could be imposed on us in the future, which could, if imposed, have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products.\nOur products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any problem with the performance of our products, such as a false jackpot or other prize, could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In addition, the occurrence of errors in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our products or software may\ngive rise to claims by our customers or by our customers\u2019 patrons, including claims by our customers for lost revenues and related litigation that could result in significant liability. Any claims brought against us by customers may result in diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees and payment of damages, lower demand for our products or services, or injury to our reputation. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover a judgment against us or a settlement payment and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and exclusions. In addition, a judgment against us or a settlement could make it difficult for us to obtain insurance in the coverage amounts necessary to adequately insure our businesses, or at all, and could materially increase our insurance premiums and deductibles. In addition, software bugs or malfunctions, errors in distribution or installation of our software, failure of our products to perform as approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies or other errors or malfunctions, may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities, including fines.\nLabor disputes and union organizing activities may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nCertain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils, including employees in Europe, South America and Canada. In particular, the majority of our employees at our printing facilities in the U.K., Chile and Quebec, the majority of our employees in Austria and Germany, and a small number of employees in the U.S. are represented by unions or work councils. While we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without any disruptions in our operations or higher labor costs.\nWe cannot assure that we will not encounter conflicts or strikes with any labor unions that represent our employees or union organizing activities at our non-unionized facilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition or our customers\u2019 operations, could cause us to lose customers, or could increase our labor costs.\nRisks Relating to Discontinued Operations\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have and could continue to significantly disrupt our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused, and could continue to cause, some of our Lottery customers to temporarily close lottery operations, decrease spending on marketing of or purchases of Lottery products or declare bankruptcy, which would adversely affect our business. In our Lottery business, we believe that difficult economic conditions have contributed, or may contribute, to reductions in spending on marketing by our customers and, in certain instances, less favorable terms under our contracts, as many of our customers face budget shortfalls and seek to cut costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also resulted, and could continue to result, in the suspension or cancellation of some sporting events which has and could continue to negatively impact the financial condition of our sportsbook customers, their ability to purchase development and other services, their risk of payment default, or their spending levels as they seek to reduce costs, each of which could negatively impact our Sports Betting business revenue.\nWithin our Lottery business, we often enter into joint ventures or other business relationships in foreign jurisdictions, which presents additional risks, including not realizing the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate.\nOur investment in foreign jurisdictions within the Lottery segment often entails entering into joint ventures or other business relationships with locally based entities, which can involve additional risks arising from our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition, inconsistency between our business interests or goals and those of our partners and disputes between us and our partners, see the risk factor above captioned \u201cWe may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of our strategic equity investments and relationships.\u201d\nWe may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions and our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit agreement to finance required capital expenditures under new contracts and meet our other cash needs or satisfy our minimum liquidity covenant. These obligations require a significant amount of cash, which would reduce our available liquidity.\nOur Lottery business generally requires significant upfront capital expenditures for lottery terminal assembly, software customization and implementation, systems and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration. In connection with a renewal or bid of a Lottery systems contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service\nrequirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain or win the contract. In connection with the renewal of Lotterie Nazionali S.r.l.\u2019s (\u201cLNS\u201d) exclusive concession to operate the Italian instant games lottery, we paid our pro rata share, or \u20ac160 million (\u20ac10 million paid in 2017 and the remaining \u20ac150 million paid in 2018), of the \u20ac800 million payment LNS was required to make to obtain the concession.\nHistorically, we have funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations, available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement. In addition, we have seen an increase in lottery requests for proposal, some involving PMAs, which include economic terms that expose us to increased risk, such as requiring the guarantee of specific income thresholds or significant upfront payments. In addition, to the extent we are compensated under any of our contractual arrangements based on a share of our customers\u2019 revenue rather than payment for our expenses and services, we may incur upfront costs (which may be significant) prior to receipt of any revenue under such arrangements. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, which are negatively affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. See the similarly titled risk factor above captioned in the \u201cRisks Relating to our Capital Structure\u201d section.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses.\nLottery\nOur Lottery business faces competition from a number of domestic and foreign businesses, some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do, which impacts our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts. In addition, the U.S. lottery industry has matured with 48 U.S. jurisdictions offering instant game lotteries and/or draw lotteries. As some jurisdictions seek to privatize or outsource lottery operations (including partial privatizations through PMAs or otherwise), we face competition from both traditional and new competitors with respect to these opportunities. In some cases, we may find it necessary or desirable to enter into strategic relationships with third parties, including competitors, and may be required to commit significant sums of money in order to pursue these opportunities.\nWe continue to operate in an industry of intense price-based competition, which has affected and could continue to affect the number and the profitability of the lottery contracts we win. We believe our principal competitors in the instant lottery product business have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, their production capacity, resulting in pricing pressures in the instant lottery product business. This may adversely affect our ability to win or renew instant lottery product contracts or may reduce the profitability of instant lottery product contracts that we do win. We also compete in the international instant lottery product business with low-price printers whose quality we believe is lower than ours in regulated environments where laws are being reinterpreted to create competition from non-traditional lottery vendors and products. Our U.S. instant lottery product business could be adversely affected if additional foreign competitors operating in Canada export their lottery products to the U.S. or if other foreign competitors establish printing facilities in the U.S. or Canada to supply the U.S.\nWe face increased price competition in our Lottery systems business from our two principal competitors in that business. This may adversely affect our ability to win or renew lottery systems contracts or reduce the profitability of lottery systems contracts that we do win. We routinely bid against IGT and Intralot in lottery systems bids. Since 2016, we have taken away several of their incumbent supplier contracts including Arizona lottery systems (IGT), Kansas lottery systems (IGT), Turkey sports betting system (Intralot), and Turkey national lottery systems (IGT).\nAny future success of our Lottery business will also depend, in part, on the success of the lottery industry in attracting and retaining players in the face of increased competition for these players\u2019 entertainment dollars, and our own success in developing innovative products and systems to achieve this goal. Our failure to achieve this goal could reduce our revenue from our Lottery operations. Additionally, pressure on state and other government budgets could lead to other forms of gaming being legalized, which could adversely impact our Lottery business.\nSports Betting\nOur Sports Betting business is also subject to significant competition. Our Sports Betting business focuses on the supply of wagering solutions to operators, and there are a number of competitors in that industry, including from current customers who may desire to provide their own wagering platforms.\nIn jurisdictions that authorize sports betting, we cannot assure that we will be successful in offering our technology, content and services to sports betting operators as we expect to face intense competition from our traditional competitors in the gaming and lottery industries and a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or, in some cases, the operators themselves), some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience in this area than we do. In addition, there is a risk that the authorization of the sale of gaming and lottery offerings via digital channels in a particular jurisdiction could, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our Gaming and Lottery offerings through traditional channels in such\njurisdiction. Any such adverse impact would be magnified to the extent we are not involved in, and generating revenue from, the provision of digital gaming and lottery products or services in such jurisdiction.\nIn order to stay competitive in our Sports Betting business, we will need to continue to create and market sports betting solutions that attract players and invest in new and emerging technologies. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide sports wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to including sports wagering in such countries.\nRecently, there has been additional significant competition in the sports wagering market as a result of the legislative changes that have encouraged new market participants. Refer to \u201cGovernment Regulation - iGaming\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of such legislative changes.\nWe offer and have in the past offered customers discounts and free trials in connection with our Sports Betting business. We cannot assure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe heavily depend on our ability to win, maintain and renew our customer contracts, including our long-term Lottery contracts, and we could lose substantial revenue if we are unable to renew certain of our contracts on substantially similar terms or at all.\nGenerally, our Lottery contracts contain initial multi-year terms, with optional renewal periods at the discretion of the customer. Upon the expiration of any such contract, including any extensions thereof, a new contract may be awarded through a competitive bidding process. Conversely, in some instances, Lottery customers are authorized to extend contracts beyond the term initially agreed in the applicable contract without subjecting the contract to competitive bidding, thereby eliminating the possibility of obtaining that new business.\nWe cannot assure that our current contracts will be extended or that we will be awarded new contracts as a result of competitive bidding processes or otherwise in the future. In addition, it is common for competitors to protest the award of Lottery contracts to us. Such protests could delay or prevent our ability to enter into a new contract. In addition, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 has caused some lotteries to delay the competitive bidding process, which in turn has delayed awards of new contracts. The termination, expiration or failure to renew one or more of our contracts could cause us to lose substantial revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to win or renew other contracts or pursue growth initiatives. We cannot assure that new or renewed contracts will contain terms that are as favorable as our current terms or will contemplate the same scope of products and services as our current contracts, and any less favorable contract terms or diminution in scope could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are also required by certain of our customers to provide surety or performance bonds in connection with our contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had $272 million of outstanding performance bonds. We cannot assure that we will continue to be able to obtain surety or performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to provide such bonds would materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing or obtain new Lottery contracts.\nGiven the increased competition in the sports wagering landscape in the U.S., it is crucial that we remain innovative in this field in order to preserve our first-mover advantage, maintain current contracts and gain new contracts.\nThe success of our Lottery and Sports Betting businesses depends on our ability to produce new and innovative products and services that respond to customer demand and create strong and sustained player appeal. If we fail to do so, we could lose business to our competitors.\nOur success depends upon our ability to respond to dynamic customer demand by producing new and innovative products and services. The process of developing new products and services is inherently complex and uncertain. If we fail to accurately anticipate customer needs and end user preferences through the development of new products and services, we could lose business to our competitors, which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn our Lottery business, we believe that innovative game concepts and game content, such as multiplier games and game content that incorporates licensed brands, can enhance the revenue of our lottery customers and distinguish us from our competitors. We cannot assure that we will be able to sustain the success of our existing game content or effectively develop or obtain from third parties game content or licensed brands that will be widely accepted both by our customers and players.\nOur Lottery business depends on suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers.\nOur production of instant lottery products, in particular, depends upon a continuous supply of raw materials, supplies, power and natural resources. Our operating results could be adversely affected by an interruption or cessation in the supply of\nthese items or a serious quality assurance lapse, including as a result of the insolvency of any of our key suppliers. Similarly, the operation of our instant ticket printing presses and the manufacture and maintenance of our lottery systems are dependent upon a regular and continuous supply of raw materials and components, many of which are manufactured or produced outside of the U.S. Certain of the components we use are customized for our products. Additionally, in 2021, we experienced pressures on the supply chain related to parts sourcing. See the above risk factor captioned \u201cWe depend on our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers\u201d.\nOur results of operations for our Sports Betting business fluctuate due to unpredictability and long sales cycles and, therefore, our periodic operating results with regards to our Sports Betting business are not guarantees of future performance.\nThe results of operations for our Sports Betting business can fluctuate due a variety of factors. It is difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue from sports wagering in our Sports Betting business because our sports wagering customers typically invest substantial time, money and other resources researching their needs and available competitive alternatives before deciding to purchase our solutions. Typically, the larger the potential sale, the more time, money and other resources will be invested by customers. Our sports wagering sales cycles also vary depending on the products and technology our prospective customers are looking to license. As a result, it may take many months after our first contact with a customer before a sale can actually be completed. In addition, we rely on our technology team to integrate our sports wagering software with that of the customer\u2019s, and therefore, our sales efforts are vulnerable to delays at both the customer level and the integration level. During these long sales cycles, events may occur that affect the size or timing of the launch, or even cause it to be cancelled, including: purchasing decisions may be postponed during periods of economic uncertainty; we or our competitors may announce or introduce new solutions; our competitors may offer lower prices; technology problems of customers may arise to slow deadlines or launch targets; or budget and purchasing priorities of customers may change. If any of these events were to occur, sales of our sports wagering solutions or services may be cancelled or delayed, which would reduce our revenue and income.\nIn light of the foregoing, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in another quarter or for the full fiscal year. We cannot assure that the seasonal trends and other factors that have impacted our historical results will repeat in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nRegulators and investors may perceive gaming or sports wagering suppliers and operators similarly, and consider their respective regulatory risk to be similar.\nWhile operators that directly provide sports wagering services to their customers are generally perceived to be exposed to a greater degree of enforcement risk than their suppliers, in some jurisdictions laws extend to directly impact such suppliers. Furthermore, a supplier\u2019s nexus with a particular jurisdiction may expose it to specific enforcement risks, irrespective of whether there has been an attempt to bring proceedings against any supported operator. In some circumstances, enforcement proceedings brought against an operator may result in action being taken against a supplier (and even brought in the absence of the former).\nUltimately, the market may view, or in the future may view, the regulatory risk associated with the business of supplying software and services to sports wagering operators as being comparable with the regulatory risk attaching to operators themselves. In such circumstances, there is an associated risk that investors may apply valuation methods to any such supplier that are the same as the valuation methods used to value operators, and which build in the same regulatory risk even though, in many territories, such suppliers would be considered sufficiently removed from the transactional activity to warrant the application of a discrete risk analysis. If suppliers to our sports wagering operators suffer financial difficulties from realized regulatory risk, they may not be able to offer their services and products, which could restrict the provision of our services and negatively impact our revenues.\nExpectations of a shift to regulated digital sports wagering may not come to fruition.\nOur business strategy includes a gradual shift into new, regulated digital gaming markets. We expect there to be an opportunity to grow revenue by being among the first systems providers to obtain a license to operate digital gaming systems in markets where end-users historically have been reliant on unregulated digital gaming. However, there is no guarantee that end users who are currently engaging in unregulated digital gaming (in the U.S. or elsewhere) will transition away from unregulated gaming to regulated gaming in the wake of regulation, which is itself uncertain as to timing and scope and varies on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Our ability to influence end-user tastes and habits is limited, and if the introduction of regulation fails to result in a migration of end-users from unregulated gaming to regulated gaming (from which we currently derive and are expected to derive revenue through revenue sharing and fixed fees arrangements with our sports wagering customers), this may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial performance and prospects.\nOn May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the U.S. overturned the PASPA, a decision that opened up a path to legalization of sports wagering across the country. Following this ruling, at least 30 states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports wagering with some of those states permitting online sports wagering. Other states are considering legislation that would permit legal sports wagering, both land based and online. As a result of the change in regulations, we expanded, and expect to further expand, our sports wagering business. Our ability to expand our digital gaming and sports wagering operations depends on adoption of regulations permitting sports wagering in the U.S. We cannot assure when, or if, such regulations will be adopted, or the terms of such regulations, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of our strategic equity investments and relationships in our Lottery business.\nUnder certain circumstances we pursue growth through strategic equity investments, including joint ventures, as a means to, among other things, gain access to new and important geographies, business opportunities and technical expertise, while simultaneously offering the potential for reducing capital requirements.\nOur strategic equity relationships include investments in LNS, Northstar New Jersey Lottery Group LLC (\u201cNorthstar New Jersey\u201d), Hellenic Lotteries S.A., Beijing Guard Libang Technology Co. Ltd., and Beijing CITIC Scientific Games Technology Co.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of these strategic equity investments and relationships and other strategic investments and relationships that we may make or enter into, or may not realize them in the timeframes expected. These arrangements pose significant risks that could have a negative effect on our operations, including: the potential diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our core business; the potential failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other value associated with these arrangements; unanticipated costs and other unanticipated events or circumstances, including losses for which we may be responsible for our pro rata portion; possible adverse effects on our operating results during any integration process; impairment charges if our strategic equity investments or relationships are not as successful as we originally anticipate; and our potential inability to achieve the intended objectives of these arrangements.\nFurthermore, our strategic equity investments and other strategic relationships pose risks arising from our reliance on our partners and our lack of sole decision-making authority, which may give rise to disputes between us and our partners. For instance, our investments in LNS and Northstar New Jersey are minority investments in ventures whose largest equity holder is Lottomatica and Gtech Corporation (now known as IGT), respectively, and, although certain corporate actions require our prior consent, we do not unilaterally control decisions relating to the governance of these entities.\nThe failure to avoid or mitigate the risks described above or other risks associated with such our strategic arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79338, "SIC": 3570, "TIC": "SGMS"}
