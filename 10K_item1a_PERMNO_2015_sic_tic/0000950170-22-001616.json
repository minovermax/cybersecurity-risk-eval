{"cik": "949870", "company": "BOSTON BEER CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks described below should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock. These are risks and uncertainties that management believes are most likely to be material and therefore are most important for an investor to consider. The Company\u2019s business operations and results may also be adversely affected by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to it, or which it currently deems immaterial, or which are similar to those faced by other companies in its industry or business in general. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Company\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results have been and are expected to continue to be affected by the pandemic and its effects.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and business have been negatively affected and could continue to be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related weak, or weakening of, economic or other conditions, particularly in the United States where the Company derives most of its revenue and profit, but also in Europe, where some of the Company\u2019s ingredient suppliers are located. National, state and local governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e., social distancing), and in certain cases, ordering businesses to close or limit operations or people to stay at home. Although the Company has been permitted to continue to operate its breweries in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, there is no assurance that the Company will be permitted to operate these facilities under every future government order or other restriction and in every location or that the third-party breweries on which the Company relies for production will similarly be permitted to continue to operate or that mass infections could materially effect staffing levels. In particular, any limitations on, or closures of, the Company\u2019s Pennsylvania, Cincinnati or Milton breweries or its third-party breweries, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture products and service customers and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the principal impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic were a significant reduction in keg demand from the on-premise channel and higher labor and safety related costs at Company-owned breweries. The Company expects to continue to be impacted as the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. Continued or additional disruptions to the Company\u2019s business and potential associated impacts to the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products, due to adverse and uncertain economic conditions, such as increased unemployment, a prolonged downturn in economic growth and other financial hardships, or a decline in consumer confidence, as a result of health concerns;\n\u2022unpredictable drinker behaviors and reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products, due to on-premise closures, government quarantines and other restrictions on social gatherings;\n\u2022inability to manufacture and ship the Company\u2019s products in quantities necessary to meet drinker demand and achieve planned shipment and depletion targets, due to disruptions at the Company-owned breweries and third-party breweries caused by:\nothe Company\u2019s inability to maintain a sufficient workforce at Company-owned breweries, due to the health-related effects of COVID-19 and similar staffing issues at third-party breweries;\nodisruptions at the Company-owned breweries and third-party breweries caused by an inability to maintain a sufficient quantity of essential supplies, such as ingredients and packaging materials, and maintain logistics and other manufacturing and supply chain capabilities necessary for the manufacture and distribution of the Company\u2019s products;\nofailure of third parties on which the Company relies, including the Company\u2019s packaging and ingredients suppliers, third-party breweries, distributors, and logistics and transportation providers, to continue to meet on a timely basis their obligations to the Company, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties;\n\u2022potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations, including increased labor, freight and logistics costs and other expenses; or\n\u2022significant changes in the conditions in markets in which the Company produces, sells or distributes Company products, including prolonged or additional quarantines, governmental and regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close the Company\u2019s operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict the ability of the Company\u2019s employees to perform necessary business functions, restrict or prevent consumers access to the Company products, or otherwise prevent the Company\u2019s third-parties from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale and support of Company products.\nThese impacts could place limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to operate effectively and could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition and operating results. The Company has implemented policies and procedures at its Company-owned breweries to address potential risks, including entrance screening and temperature checks, face mask requirements, reorganizing work to increase social distancing between and among shifts, and adding two hours of workspace cleaning per shift. As the situation continues to evolve and more information and guidance becomes available, the Company may adjust its current policies and procedures, to address the rapidly changing variables related to the pandemic. Additional impacts may arise, of which the Company is not currently aware. The nature and extent of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nRisks Associated with Our Industry\nThe Company faces substantial competition.\nThe High End and Beyond Beer categories within the United States are highly competitive due to the participation of large domestic and international brewers in the categories and the increasing number of craft brewers and craft distilleries, who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target drinkers.\nThe two largest brewers in the United States, AB InBev and Molson Coors, participate actively in the High End and Beyond Beer categories, through numerous launches of new hard seltzers and spirit RTDs from existing brands or new brands, importing and distributing import brands, and with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing brands. In addition, AB InBev\u2019s High End Division and Molson Coors\u2019 Tenth and Blake were formed as business units headquartered in the United States that are focused exclusively on competing in the High End and Beyond Beer categories. Imported beers, such as Corona\u00ae, Heineken\u00ae, Modelo Especial\u00ae and Stella Artois\u00ae, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. Heineken and Constellation Brands (owner of the United States Distribution rights to Corona and Modelo Especial) may have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. The Company anticipates competition will remain strong as some existing beverage companies are building more capacity, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles. The anticipated continued growth in the sales of hard seltzers, craft-brewed domestic beers, imported beers and spirits RTDs is expected to increase the competition in the market for High End beer and Beyond Beer occasions within the United States and, as a result, the Company may well face competitive pricing pressures and the demand for and market share of the Company\u2019s products may fluctuate and possibly decline.\nThe Company\u2019s products compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. The Company competes with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for traditional retail shelf, cold box and tap space, as well as e-commerce placement and for marketing focus by the Company\u2019s Distributors and their customers, all of which\nalso distribute and sell other alcoholic beverage products. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, including AB InBev, Molson Coors, Constellation, Heineken and Mark Anthony Brands, have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. Moreover, the introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with the Company\u2019s products or that diminish the importance of the Company\u2019s products to retailers or Distributors may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nFurther, while the number of craft brewers and craft distilleries continues to increase, the alcoholic beverage industry has also seen continued consolidation among brewers in order to take advantage of cost savings opportunities for supplies, distribution and operations. Illustrative of this consolidation is AB InBev\u2019s $107 billion purchase of SAB Miller and the related sale by SAB Miller to Molson Coors of its 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture with Molson Coors, as well as Heineken\u2019s acquisition of Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $1 billion. Also, in the last several years, both AB InBev and Molson Coors have introduced numerous new hard seltzers and purchased multiple regional craft breweries and craft distilleries with the intention to expand the capacity and distribution of these brands.\nMore recently in 2021 and entering 2022, large non-alcoholic beverage companies including Pepsi, Coca-Cola Company (\u201cCoke\") and Monster Beverage Corporation (\u201cMonster\u201d) have begun to enter these markets through licensing agreements with alcoholic beverage companies to develop alcohol versions of existing traditional non-alcohol brands or, in the case of Monster, the acquisition of the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in early 2022. Coke has entered into agreements with Molson Coors to develop, market and sell Topo Chico brand Hard Seltzer. Coke also announced agreements with Constellation to develop, market and sell FRESCA\u2122 Mixed, a line of spirits RTDs. As previously discussed, the Company has entered into an agreement with Pepsi to develop, market and sell alcohol beverages which include Hard Mountain Dew, to take advantage of this trend.\nDue to the increased leverage that these combined operations will have in distribution and sales and marketing expenses, the costs to the Company of competing could increase. The potential also exists for these large competitors to increase their influence with their Distributors, making it difficult for smaller beverage companies to maintain their market presence or enter new markets. The continuing consolidation could also reduce the contract brewing capacity that is available to the Company. These potential increases in the number and availability of competing brands, the costs to compete, reductions in contract brewing capacity and decreases in distribution support and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nChanges in public attitudes and drinker tastes could harm the Company\u2019s business. Regulatory changes in response to public attitudes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe alcoholic beverage industry has been the subject of considerable societal and political attention for several years, due to public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including driving under the influence, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol, including alcoholism. As an outgrowth of these concerns, the possibility exists that advertising by beer producers could be restricted, that additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements might be imposed, that further restrictions on the sale of alcohol might be imposed or that there may be renewed efforts to impose increased excise or other taxes on beer sold in the United States.\nThe domestic beer industry, other than the market for High End beer occasions and Beyond Beer occasions, has experienced a decline in shipments over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful hard seltzers. beers and spirts RTDs, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies. If consumption of the Company\u2019s products in general were to come into disfavor among domestic drinkers, or if the domestic alcohol beverage industry were subjected to significant additional societal pressure or governmental regulations, the Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, certain states are considering or have passed laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of marijuana. Currently it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcohol, but it is possible that legal marijuana usage could adversely impact the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company is dependent on its distributors.\nIn the United States, where approximately 96% of its beer is sold, the Company sells most of its alcohol beverages to independent beer Distributors for distribution to retailers and, ultimately, to drinkers. Although the Company currently has arrangements with over 400 Distributors, sustained growth will require it to maintain such relationships and possibly enter\ninto agreements with additional Distributors. Changes in control or ownership within the current distribution network could lead to less support of the Company\u2019s products.\nContributing to distribution risk is the fact that the Company\u2019s distribution agreements are generally terminable by the Distributor on relatively short notice. While these distribution agreements contain provisions giving the Company enforcement and termination rights, some state laws prohibit the Company from exercising these contractual rights. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its existing distribution arrangements may be adversely affected by the fact that many of its Distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large percentage of their revenue and, therefore, they may be influenced by such producers. If the Company\u2019s existing distribution agreements are terminated, it may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms, which may result in an increase in the costs of distribution.\nNo assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current distribution network or secure additional Distributors on terms not less favorable to the Company than its current arrangements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThere is no assurance of continued growth or that the Company can adapt to the challenges of the changing competitive environment.\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Company experienced a decline in the demand for its products, as craft beer growth rates slowed and the hard cider category declined. From 2018 to 2021, the Company experienced increases in demand for its products, driven by growth in its Truly and Twisted Tea brands, and grew 13%, 22%, 37% and 22% in depletion volume for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 25, 2021, the market for hard seltzer products experienced decelerating growth trends, which resulted in the annual volume growth rate declining from 158% in 2020 to 13% in 2021. The 2021 slowdown in growth trends greatly impacted the Company's volume of production and shipments, as well as its volume projections for the future. The 2021 volume reduction resulted in increased supply chain related costs which were recorded during the second half of the year. These direct costs include the destruction of excess inventory, provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, property, plant and equipment impairments, write-offs of third-party production prepayments and provisions for costs associated with the termination of various third-party production contracts. The combined expense of $102.9 million recognized for the above items contributed to the Company's decrease in operating income from 2020.\nThe Company is targeting shipment and depletion volume growth of between 4% and 10% in 2022. The Company\u2019s ability to sustain growth trends and meet these targets may be affected by an increasing number of competing beverages. The development of new products by the Company to meet these challenges may lead to reduced sales of the Company\u2019s existing brands and there is no guarantee that these new product initiatives will generate stable long term volume. Additionally, changes in the use of media and technology are impacting the economics of how brands are marketed to drinkers and may be diminishing the traditional competitive advantage the Company may have had in buying national media relative to smaller brands. While the Company believes that a combination of innovation, new brand messaging and exploration of new media, and increased investment and sales execution can lead to increased demand, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s actions will be successful in maintaining the Company\u2019s historical levels of profitability. Reduced sales, among other factors, could lead to lower brewery utilization, lower funds available to invest in brand support and reduced profitability, and these challenges may require a different mix and level of marketing investments to stabilize and grow volumes. A lower growth environment or periods of sales declines will present challenges for the Company to motivate and retain employees, maintain the current levels of distributor and retailer support of its brands, and fund its current brand investment levels, and could potentially require a review of long term organization and brewery needs. Currently, the Company believes it can continue to grow in 2022 and in future years, but there is no guarantee its efforts will be successful or profitable.\nThe Company may not be able to increase supply to meet the increased demand for its products.\nSince 2017, demand for the Company\u2019s products has grown significantly and the Company currently estimates depletion growth in 2022 to be between 4% and 10%. These estimated increases would result in 2022 depletion volume at over 2.4 times 2017 volumes.\nAs demand for its products has grown, the Company has faced increasing challenges in meeting that demand. The challenges have been both production constraints, primarily resulting from canning and variety pack capacity limitations, and can supply constraints. The Company has also become more reliant on third party-owned breweries, particularly City Brewing Company, LLC, to meet demand, as the percentage of its volume produced at Company owned breweries decreased from over 90% in 2017 to approximately 56% in 2021. The Company currently expects that the percentage of total production at\nbreweries and packaging facilities owned by others will be approximately 30% in 2022. The Company\u2019s reliance on production at City Brewing Company, LLC to meet demand has grew from 23% of the Company\u2019s total production volume in 2019 to 32% in 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to grow and continue to meet increasing consumer demand will be affected by:\n\u2022its ability to meet production goals and/or targets at the Company\u2019s owned breweries and third party-owned breweries;\n\u2022its ability to enter into new brewing contracts with third party-owned breweries on commercially acceptable terms;\n\u2022disruption or other operating performance issues at the Company\u2019s owned breweries or limits on the availability of suitable production capacity at third party-owned breweries;\n\u2022its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain packaging materials and ingredients, such as cans, flavorings, cardboard wraps and glass bottles from suppliers; and\n\u2022its ability to reduce risk of both over and under supply by improving and automating manual internal processes for demand and production planning.\nIf the Company fails to increase supply to meet consumer demand for its products, the Company\u2019s business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s advertising and promotional investments may affect the Company\u2019s financial results but not be effective.\nThe Company has made and expects to continue to make, significant advertising and promotional expenditures to enhance its brands. These expenditures may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in a particular quarter or even for the full year, and may not result in increased sales. Variations in the levels of advertising and promotional expenditures have in the past caused, and are expected in the future to continue to cause, variability in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations. While the Company attempts to invest only in effective advertising and promotional activities, it is difficult to correlate such investments with sales results, and there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s expenditures will be effective in building brand equity or growing long term sales.\nThe Company is dependent on key packaging suppliers and an increase in packaging costs could harm the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe demand for packaging materials in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity, as manufacturers attempt to adjust their supply chains to keep up with the increased demand, which has further increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Truly Hard Seltzer brand beverages are primarily packaged in sleek cans and Twisted Tea brand beverages are primarily packaged in standard cans. In 2020 and 2021, as the Truly and the Twisted brand families grew significantly and overall demand for cans increased, the Company experienced supply constraints for cans. These supply constraints have in turn impacted the Company\u2019s production schedules and increased can cost by having to use a more expensive supplier. The Company is working closely with its suppliers to ensure that the Company has an adequate supply of packaging materials. In addition, the Company is working to increase packaging capacity to accommodate its expected needs for 2022 but there is no assurance it will be successful.\nThe Company maintains competitive sources for the supply of packaging materials, such as cans, glass, cardboard wraps and shipping cases. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. In 2021, crowns and labels were each supplied by single sources. Although the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available, the loss of any of the Company\u2019s packaging materials suppliers could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured. Additionally, there has been acquisition, change in control and consolidation activity in several of the packaging supplier networks which could potentially lead to further disruption in supply and changes in economics. If packaging costs continue to increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along through increased prices. The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for certain packaging materials that have shielded it from some cost increases. These contracts have varying lengths and terms and there is no guarantee that the economics of these contracts can be replicated when renewed. The Company\u2019s inability to preserve the current economics on renewal could expose the Company to significant cost increases in future years. Some of these contracts require the Company to make commitments on minimum volume of purchases based on Company forecasts. If the Company's needs decline significantly from its forecasts, the Company would likely incur storage costs for excess production or contractual penalties that might be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nInability to react to changes in demand, reliance on Company-owned production facilities, reduced availability of breweries owned by others, and inability to leverage investment in the Company-owned breweries could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or financial results.\nAs previously discussed, during 2021, the market for hard seltzer products experienced decelerating growth trends which resulted in the annual volume growth rate declining from 158% in 2020 to 13% in 2021. The volume reduction resulted in combined direct supply chain related costs of $102.9 million recorded during the second half of the year.\nThe changes in growth trends in the Company\u2019s business, particularly for the Truly Hard Seltzer Brand, as well as added product complexity, heighten the management challenges that the Company faces. In recent years, the Company has had periods of excess capacity that were nevertheless accompanied by product shortages and service issues. The Company\u2019s supply chain struggled under the increased volume and experienced increased operational and freight costs as it reacted. In response to these issues, the Company significantly increased its packaging capabilities and tank capacity and added personnel to address these challenges. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively address changing consumer demand or manage such increasing product complexity without experiencing similar issues in the future. Planning failures, operating inefficiencies, insufficient employee training, control deficiencies or other similar issues could well have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The growth of the Company, changes in operating procedures and increased complexity have required significant capital investment. In the future, the Company on an overall basis may not see any operating cost leverage from these investments and there is no guarantee that it will.\nDuring 2021, the Company produced approximately 56% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company. This reliance on its own breweries exposes the Company to capacity constraints and risk of disruption of supply, as these breweries are operating at or close to current capacity in peak months. Management believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its brewing locations is temporarily interrupted, although as volumes at the Pennsylvania Brewery increase, severe interruptions there would be problematic, particularly during peak seasons. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental action, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shutdowns, pandemic-related or other staffing shortages, or natural or unavoidable catastrophes. If interruptions were to occur, the Company could face significant delays in starting replacement brewing locations and its operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company continues to avail itself of capacity at third-party breweries. During 2021, approximately 32% of the Company\u2019s annual shipment volume was brewed and/or packaged under service agreements with City Brewing Company, LLC. In selecting third party breweries for brewing services arrangements, the Company carefully weighs a brewery\u2019s sleek can packaging and automated variety packaging capability and capacity, its quality control capabilities throughout the production process and its ability to utilize traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods. To the extent that the Company needs to avail itself of a third-party brewing services arrangement, it exposes itself to higher than planned costs of operating under such contract arrangements than would apply at the Company-owned breweries, potential lower service levels and reliability than internal production, and potential unexpected declines in the brewing capacity available to it, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The use of such third party facilities also creates higher logistical costs and uncertainty in the ability to deliver product to the Company\u2019s customers efficiently and on time.\nAs the beer industry continues to consolidate and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could brew, ferment or package some of its products, if necessary, has become a more significant concern and, thus, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s needs will be uniformly met. The Company continues to work at its Company-owned breweries and with its third-party brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. Nevertheless, should an interruption occur, the Company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and/or increased production and/or distribution costs and be required to make significant capital investments to secure alternative capacity for certain brands and packages, the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. A production interruption caused by an acquisition or change of control of City Brewing or a simultaneous interruption at several of the Company\u2019s production locations would likely cause significant disruption, increased costs and, potentially, lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s emphasis on owning production facilities requires it to continue to make a significant level of capital expenditure to maintain and improve these facilities and to incur significant fixed operating costs to support them. In an uncertain volume environment, the Company faces the risk of not being able to support the owned brewery operating costs, if volumes were to decline. At the same time, despite making these expenditures and incurring these costs, if demand were to further increase above current volume estimates, the Company could still face the risk of not being able to meet the increased demand.\nThe Company attempts to mitigate production and distribution risks through a combination of owned breweries and access to third-party contract facilities, but there is no guarantee that this strategy will be successful, and it might result in short term costs and inefficiencies which could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nTurnover in Company leadership or other key positions may lead to loss of key knowledge or capability and adversely impact Company performance.\nThe Company has an experienced leadership team with an established track record of business success and innovation in the beverage and consumer goods industries. For example, Dave Burwick joined the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer in 2018. Prior to commencing that role, Mr. Burwick had served on Boston Beer\u2019s Board of Directors since 2005. His most recent prior role was Chief Executive Officer of Peet\u2019s Coffee and prior to joining Peet\u2019s, Mr. Burwick served as President of North America for Weight Watchers and in numerous leadership roles over 20 years at PepsiCo, including Chief Marketing Officer of Pepsi-Cola North America. The Company may well experience changes in key leadership or key positions in the future. The departure of key leadership personnel, especially a Chief Executive Officer, can take from the Company significant knowledge and experience. This loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts. Attracting, retaining, integrating and developing high performance individuals in key roles is a core component of the Company\u2019s strategy for addressing its business opportunities. Attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions, such as the declining growth environment that faced the Company in 2021. Failure to attract and retain the right talent, or to manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover smoothly, would affect the Company's ability to meet its challenges and may cause the Company to miss performance objectives or financial targets.\nThe Company has significantly increased its product offerings and distribution footprint, which increases complexity and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and financial results.\nThe Company has significantly increased the number of commercially available hard seltzers, beers, hard ciders, spirits RTDs and distilled spirits that it produces. In the last five years, the Company has developed, introduced and reformulated many new and existing beverage styles under the Truly Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. The Dogfish Head brand, acquired in July 2019, currently has over 25 styles of beer, 15 styles of distilled spirits, 5 spirits RTDs, three brewery tap rooms, a restaurant, and a boutique Inn. In January 2020, the Company opened the Samuel Adams Tap Room and small brewery in downtown Boston. The Company currently operates 10 retail locations, including eight brewery tap rooms, a cidery tasting room and a restaurant, where its beverages are sold and consumed on-premise. The Company developed and introduced the Bevy Long drink brand in late 2021 and has plans to launch three additional brands in 2022. Two of these three new brands, Hard Mountain Dew and Sauza Agave cocktails, are under agreements with Pepsi and Beam, respectively. During 2022, mostly under the Truly brand, the Company has plans to add new beverage styles and reformulate existing styles of beverages.\nThese additional brands, styles, reformulations and locations, along with the increases in demand for certain existing brands, have added to the complexity of the Company\u2019s product development process, as well as its brewing, fermenting, distilling, packaging, marketing and selling processes, and retail operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively manage such increased complexity, without experiencing coordination issues, operating inefficiencies, supply shortages or control deficiencies. Such inefficiencies or deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results\n.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition of Dogfish Head involves a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOn July 3, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Dogfish Head Brewery and various related operations, through the acquisition of all of the equity interests held by certain private entities in Off-Centered Way LLC, the parent holding company of the Dogfish Head Brewery operations. This transaction continues to involve certain risks, the occurrence of\nwhich could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u2022adverse impact on overall profitability, if the Company\u2019s expanded operations do not achieve the growth prospects, net revenues, earnings, cost or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in the Company\u2019s valuation models, or delays in the realization thereof; and\n\u2022the potential future write-off of significant amounts of intangible assets and/or other tangible assets if the Dogfish Head business does not perform in the future as expected, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts\nThe Company cannot assure that it will realize the expected benefits of the Dogfish Head transaction. The Company\u2019s failure to adequately manage the risks associated with the transaction could have a material adverse effect on its business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in drinker attitudes on brand equity and reliance on the Company\u2019s founders in the Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head brand communications may adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s production and results of operations.\nThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that drinkers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity, negative comments in social media, or our responses to negative publicity or comments. There is also no guarantee that the brand equities that the Company has built in its brands will continue to appeal to drinkers. Changes in drinker attitudes or demands, or competitor activity and promotion, could adversely affect the strength of the Company\u2019s brands and the revenue that is generated from that strength. It is possible that the Company could react to such changes and reposition its brands, but there is no certainty that the Company would be able to maintain volumes, pricing power and profitability. It is also possible that marketing messages or other actions taken by the Company could damage its brand equities, as opposed to building them. If such damage were to occur, it would likely have a negative effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nIn addition to these inherent brand risks, C. James Koch, the founder and Chairman of the Company, as well as the founders of Dogfish Head brand, Samuel Calagione, Founder and Brewer, Dogfish Head Brewery and Mariah Calagione, Founder and Communitarian, Dogfish Head Brewery, are an integral part of the Company\u2019s history, brand equity and current and potential future brand messaging and the Company relies on the positive public perception of these founders. The role of these founders as founders, brewers and leaders of the Company is emphasized as part of the Company\u2019s brand communication and has appeal to some drinkers. If these founders were not available to the Company to continue their active roles, their absence could negatively affect the strength of the Company\u2019s messaging and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s growth prospects. The Company and its brands may also be impacted if drinkers\u2019 perceptions of these founders including their social or political views, were to change negatively. If any negative changes were to occur, the Company might need to adapt its strategy for communicating its key messages regarding its history, equity and current and potential future brand messaging. Any such change in the Company\u2019s messaging strategy might have a detrimental impact on the future growth of the Company.\nThe Company is dependent on key ingredient suppliers, including foreign sources; its dependence on foreign sources creates foreign currency exposure for the Company; the Company\u2019s use of natural ingredients creates weather and crop reliability and excess/shortage inventory exposure for the Company.\nThe Company purchases a substantial portion of the ingredients used in its beverages including its flavorings, malt, hops, apples and other ingredients, from a limited number of foreign and domestic suppliers. The Company has historically not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its ingredient suppliers and currently believes that it will have sufficient supply of ingredients in 2022. The Company believes that there are alternative sources available for some of the ingredients, but there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to acquire such ingredients from substitute sources on a timely or cost-effective basis, in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders. The loss or significant reduction in the capability of a supplier to support the Company\u2019s requirements could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results, until alternative supply arrangements were secured.\nThe Company\u2019s beverages include many unique and proprietary flavors and combinations of flavors and some of these flavorings are single sourced. Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brand beverages are particularly reliant on the use of flavorings and variety of flavors as part of their appeal to drinkers.\nThe Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beer from four suppliers during 2021. Nevertheless, the Company believes that there are other malt vendors available that are capable of supplying part of its needs. The\nCompany is exposed to the quality of the barley crop each year, and significant failure of a crop would adversely affect the Company\u2019s costs.\nThe Company uses Noble hop varieties from Europe for many of its Samuel Adams beers and also uses hops grown in other areas of Europe, the United States, and New Zealand. Noble hops are grown in several specific areas in Germany and the Czech Republic that are recognized for growing hops with superior taste and aroma properties. The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site. The performance and availability of the hops, as with any agricultural product, may be materially adversely affected by factors such as adverse weather or pests and there is no guarantee the contracts will be fulfilled completely. The Company enters into purchase commitments with nine primary hop dealers and attempts to maintain a one to two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply and procures hops needed for new beers, based on its best estimate of likely short-term demand. The failure of management\u2019s assumptions regarding future sales growth, product mix and hops market conditions to prove accurate could result in future material losses.\nThe Company uses special varieties of apples in its ciders that it believes are important for the ciders\u2019 flavor profile. These apples are sourced primarily from European and United States suppliers and include bittersweet apples from France and culinary apples from Italy and Washington state. There is limited availability of these apples and many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating from apples to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply.\nThe Company\u2019s new product development can also be constrained by any limited availability of the desired ingredients. Growth rates higher than planned or the introduction of new products requiring special ingredients could create demand for ingredients greater than the Company can source.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts for certain hops and apples are payable in Euros, Pounds Sterling and New Zealand dollars, and therefore, the Company is subject to the risk that the Euro, Pound or New Zealand dollar may fluctuate adversely against the U.S. dollar. The Company has, as a practice, not hedged this exposure, although this practice is regularly reviewed. The cost of hops has increased in recent years due to the rising market price of hops and exchange rate changes. The continuation of these trends will impact the Company\u2019s product cost and potentially the Company\u2019s ability to meet the demand for its beers. The Company buys some other ingredients and capital equipment from foreign suppliers for which the Company also carries exposure to foreign exchange rate changes. Significant adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain operating hazards that could result in unexpected costs or product recalls that could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by all beverage companies, such as potential contamination of ingredients or products by bacteria or other external agents that may be wrongfully or accidentally introduced into products or packaging, or defective packaging and handling. Such occurrences may create bad tasting beverages, or pose health risk to the consumer or risk to the integrity and safety of the packaging. These could result in unexpected costs to the Company and, in the case of a costly product recall, potentially serious damage to the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality, as well as product liability claims.\nThe Company relies upon complex information systems and vulnerabilities or disruptions of these systems could expose us to liability and harm our business and operations.\nThe Company depends on information technology to be able to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial and accounting reporting accuracy to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. If the Company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, the Company could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. The Company recognizes that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware and ransomware. The Company has dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats. However, as with all large information technology systems, the Company\u2019s systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting information, disrupting business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information. Such unauthorized access could disrupt business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, remediation costs or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as litigation against the Company by third parties adversely affected by the unauthorized access. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The Company also relies on\nthird parties for supply of software, software and data hosting and telecommunications and networking, and is reliant on those third parties for the quality and integrity of these complex services. Failure by a third party supplier could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nAn increase in energy costs could harm the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIn the last five years, the Company has experienced significant variation in direct and indirect energy costs, and energy costs could change unpredictably. Increased energy costs would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs, including increases in the cost of ingredients and supplies. The Company\u2019s future operating expenses and margins could be dependent on its ability to manage the impact of such cost increases. If energy costs increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along through increased prices.\nThe Class B shareholder has significant control over the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock is not entitled to any voting rights except for the right as a class to (1) approve certain mergers, charter amendments and by-law amendments and (2) elect a minority of the directors of the Company. Although not as a matter of right, the Class A stockholders have also been afforded the opportunity to vote on an advisory basis on executive compensation. Consequently, the election of a majority of the Company\u2019s directors and all other matters requiring stockholder approval are currently decided by C. James Koch, who is the founder and Chairman of the Company, as the holder of 100% of the voting rights to the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Koch is able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the composition of the board of directors, approval of equity-based and other executive compensation and other significant corporate and governance matters, such as approval of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and makes most material transactions difficult or impossible to accomplish without the support of Mr. Koch. While Mr. Koch is currently the 100% holder of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock, there is nothing that prevents Mr. Koch or his heirs from transferring some or all shares of the Class B Common Stock to others.\nRisks Related to Law and Regulations\nChanges in tax, environmental and other regulations, government shutdowns or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade or other regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly regulated by federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with Distributors, environmental impact of operations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent reevaluation, varying interpretations and political debate, and inquiries from governmental regulators charged with their enforcement. In addition, any delays in federal or state government required approvals caused by federal or state government shutdowns, similar to the January 2019 federal government shutdown, could prevent new brands or innovations from getting to market on time or at all. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations to which the Company\u2019s operations are subject or any revisions to such laws and regulations or the failure to pay taxes or other fees imposed on the Company\u2019s operations and results could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of the Company\u2019s licenses, permits or approvals, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in federal and other tax rates could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThere is no guarantee that the Company will not face litigation that could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nWhile the Company has from time to time in the past been involved in material litigation, it is not currently a party to any pending or threatened litigation, the outcome of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or the results of its operations. In general, while the Company believes it conducts its business appropriately in accordance with laws, regulations and industry guidelines, claims, whether or not meritorious, could be asserted against the Company that might adversely impact the Company\u2019s results. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below.\nRisks Related to General Economic Conditions\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and cash flow may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic, financial and societal market conditions.\nVolatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s performance and operating results in a variety of ways, including: (a) prices for energy and agricultural products may rise faster than current estimates, including increases resulting from currency fluctuations; (b) the Company\u2019s key suppliers may not be able to fund their capital requirements, resulting in disruption in the supplies of the Company\u2019s raw and packaging materials; (c) the credit risks of the Company\u2019s Distributors may increase; (d) the impact of currency fluctuations on amounts owed to the Company by distributors that pay in foreign currencies; (e) the Company\u2019s credit facility, or portion thereof, may become unavailable at a time when needed by the Company to meet critical needs; (f) overall beer consumption may decline; or (g) drinkers of the Company\u2019s products may change their purchase preferences and frequency, which might result in sales declines.", "PERMNO": 82634, "SIC": 2082, "TIC": "SAM"}
