Carefully consider the risks described below, which represent some of the more critical risk factors that affect the Company, as well as the other information that has been provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below include all known material risks faced by the Company. Additional risks not presently known may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations.\nDifficult economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. The success of the Company\u2019s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside its control and difficult to predict. Factors such as commodity prices, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) can have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and investments, which could reduce its revenues and profitability. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead or require businesses to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values and to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts because their access to capital is impeded. This would in turn affect the Company\u2019s profitability or results of operations. These factors may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers. Volatility in the conditions of the global economic markets can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital at attractive prices. The Company\u2019s ongoing exposure to credit risks on its accounts receivable balances are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company has procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables; however, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Unstable economic conditions may also increase the volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s debt structure. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $1,032.4 million of consolidated indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations and refinance its indebtedness is dependent upon its ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, seasonality and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Company\u2019s debt levels and the terms of its indebtedness may limit its liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and pursuing other business opportunities due to difficulties accessing the credit and capital markets. If the Company is unable to repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due, it may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including undertaking alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or dedicating an unsustainable level of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s overall debt level and/or market conditions could lead the credit rating agencies to lower the Company\u2019s corporate credit ratings, which could limit its ability to issue additional debt in amounts and/or on terms that it considers reasonable.\nWe are exposed to fluctuating prices of oil and decreased demand for oil. The market for the Company\u2019s offshore support and shipping services is impacted by the comparative price for exploring, developing, and producing oil, by the supply and cost of natural gas and by the corresponding supply and demand for oil, both globally and regionally. Among other factors, the increased supply of oil and natural gas from the development of new oil and natural gas supply sources and technologies to improve recovery from current sources particularly shale, have reduced the price of oil. The advent of electric cars, development of alternative sources of energy to hydrocarbons, such as solar and wind power, could also diminish the demand for oil and natural gas. Such diminution of demand could place continued or additional pressure on the price of oil and therefore demand for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services, as developing offshore oil fields, particularly in deep waters, is one of the most expensive sources of hydrocarbons. Other factors that influence the supply and demand of and the relative price of oil include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, foreign exchange rates, economic conditions and actions by major oil-producing countries. The price of oil and the relative cost to extract, proximity to market and political imperatives of countries with offshore deposits affect the willingness to commit investment for contract drilling rigs and offshore support vessels used for offshore exploration, field development and production activities, which in turn affects the Company\u2019s results of operations. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices or rising costs result in projects being delayed or canceled and can give rise to impairments of the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine and Shipping Services assets.\nBeginning in the second half of 2014 and through the beginning of 2016, the price of oil dropped significantly, from a high of $107 per barrel during 2014 to a twelve-year low of less than $27 per barrel in February 2016 (on the New York Mercantile Exchange). While prices have recovered recently, they still remain depressed. As of December 31, 2016, the price per barrel was approximately $54. When the Company\u2019s customers experience low commodity prices or come to believe that they will be low in the future, they generally reduce their capital spending for offshore drilling, exploration and field development. Since 2014, offshore activity has been declining. The significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices continues to cause a reduction in many of the Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services customers\u2019 exploratory, drilling, completion and other production activities and, as a result, related spending on the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services. Because a prolonged material downturn in crude oil and natural gas prices and/or perceptions of long-term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans for exploration and production, the duration of reduced activity will likely continue for some time and the Company believes it will continue to result in a corresponding decline in demand for the equipment of Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services. The prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, has materially and adversely affected the Company by negatively impacting its fleet utilization, which in turn has negatively affected its revenues, cash flows and profitability, the fair market value of its vessels\nand its ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital to finance its business. It could also affect the collectability of the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services receivables and its ability to retain skilled personnel. Periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry and can lead to the Company\u2019s vessels being idle for long periods of time.\nIn addition, if difficult market conditions persist and an anticipated recovery is delayed beyond the Company\u2019s expectation, further deterioration in the fair value of vessels already impaired or revisions to the Company\u2019s forecasts may result in the Company recording additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods.\nDemand for many of the Company\u2019s services is impacted by the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production industry. The level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity has historically been volatile. This volatility is likely to continue. The level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including recessions and the level of activity in energy-consuming markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u2022\nassessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore and the relative cost of, and success in, doing so on land;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of oil and gas and oilfield service companies operating offshore;\n\u2022\nworldwide supply and demand for energy, other petroleum products and chemical products;\n\u2022\navailability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and international political and economic conditions, and policies including cabotage and local content laws;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting exploration, development, energy production and consumption;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and pricing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries\u037e\n\u2022\ninternational sanctions on oil producing countries and the lifting of certain sanctions against Iran\u037e\n\u2022\ncivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere\u037e\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation;\n\u2022\nregulation of drilling activities and the availability of drilling permits and concessions; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital projects.\nThe prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices has caused a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, which has resulted in a decline in demand and lower rates for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services and, in turn, lower utilization levels for Offshore Marine Services over the last two years. The continuation or worsening of such decrease in activity is likely to further reduce the day rates and utilization of the Company's Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services business, which would in turn affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, an increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity or petroleum drilling activity since the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 project development lead and planning times, reserve replacement needs, expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing vessels all combine to affect demand for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services vessels. Moreover, for the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 15% of Offshore Marine Services\u2019 operating revenues were earned in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and are therefore dependent on levels of activity in that region, which may differ from levels of activity in other regions of the world due to more localized factors.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on the ability of the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services to retain customers. The Company\u2019s customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider. The Company must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to its\ncustomers. Should this not be achieved, the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected, which in turn could affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company is subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. The Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that could materially adversely affect a portion of its business operations or materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters.\nThe Company may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and its results of operations, and may result in additional risks to its businesses. The Company continuously evaluates the acquisition and disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake significant transactions. Any such transaction could be material to the Company\u2019s business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business and the purchase of equity interests or assets. The form of consideration associated with such transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates the disposition of its operating businesses and assets, in whole or in part, which could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests in its subsidiaries (privately or through a public offering), or the spin-off of equity interests of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to its stockholders. For instance, on February 9, 2017, the Company filed Amendment No. 1 to the Form 10 it had initially filed with the SEC on December 13, 2016 in connection with a potential spin-off of SMHI to SEACOR's shareholders. We are not obligated to effect the spin-off of SMHI and no assurance can be given that the Company will ultimately choose to do so. To the extent a SMHI Spin-off does not occur prior to January 11, 2018, the holders of the 3.75% Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or part of the notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on that date; however, if the SMHI Spin-off is consummated, this requirement to repurchase the 3.75% Subsidiary Senior Notes would immediately terminate. In addition, no assurance can be given that the spin-off will achieve the Company\u2019s intended results or that the Company and SMHI will realize the intended benefits of the spin-off.\nThese types of significant transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenue and income streams, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, potential acceleration of taxes currently deferred, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, the Company cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or that significant transactions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or its results of operations. If the Company were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, it may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in its amount of debt or the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock.\nIf, following the completion of the SMHI Spin-off, there is a determination that the separation is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then the Company, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. The distribution is conditioned upon the Company\u2019s receipt of an opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, counsel to the Company, substantially to the effect that the separation qualifies as a transaction that is described in Section 355 of the Code. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and SMHI regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the Company or SMHI after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable, the Company and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nPrior to the separation, the Company and SMHI will enter into a tax matters agreement (the \u201cSMHI Tax Matters Agreement\u201d) that will govern the parties\u2019 respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. Taxes relating to or arising out of the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be borne by the Company, except, in general, if such failure is attributable to SMHI\u2019s action or inaction or the Company\u2019s action or inaction, as the case may be, or any event (or series of events) involving the assets or stock of SMHI\nor the assets or stock of the Company, as the case may be, in which case the resulting liability will be borne in full by SMHI or the Company, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if the Company is not responsible for its tax liabilities under the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement, the Company nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if SMHI were to fail to pay them. If he Company is required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the SMHI Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may again invest, in new business plans or acquisitions, some of which may not be directly linked to existing business lines or activities. These activities may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the plans or acquisitions, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. Investments in these positions also may involve securities or other assets that are not very liquid. As a result of the risks inherent in new ventures, there can be no assurance that any such venture will be successful, or that new ventures will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company engages in hedging activities which expose it to risks. For corporate purposes and also as part of its trading activities, the Company has in the past and may in the future use futures and swaps to hedge risks, such as escalation in fuel costs, the cost of agricultural materials and movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. With respect to ethanol, the Company may attempt to offset the effects of volatility by entering into forward contracts to sell a portion of its ethanol or purchase a portion of its corn requirements. The Company may also use other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn and ethanol. However, hedging activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. The Company may also purchase inventory in larger than usual levels to lock-in costs when it believes there may be large increases in the price of raw materials or other materials used in its businesses. Such purchases expose the Company to risks of meeting margin calls and drawing on its capital, counterparty risk due to failure of an exchange or institution with which it has entered into a swap, incurring higher costs than competitors or similar businesses that do not engage in such strategies, and losses on its investment portfolio. Such strategies can also cause earnings to be volatile. If the Company fails to offset such volatility, its results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been adversely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill. On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deepwater drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, sank after an apparent blowout and fire resulting in a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Macondo well (the \u201cDeepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident\u201d). The Company and its customers have extensive operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. New or additional government regulations or laws concerning drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other regions have in the past and could in the future materially increase the cost of drilling operation is the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company could incur liability in connection with its provision of spill response services. The Company provided spill and emergency response services, including in response to the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident in 2010. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Response Management, L.L.C. (\u201cORM\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, and National Response Corporation (\u201cNRC\u201d), which was a subsidiary of the Company at the time operating in the Company\u2019s now discontinued Environmental Services segment, are currently defendants in litigation arising from the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident. Although companies are generally exempt in the United States from liability under the CWA for their own actions and omissions in providing spill response services, this exemption might not apply if a company were found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct, or if it were to have failed to provide these services consistent with the National Contingency Plan or as otherwise directed under the CWA. In addition, the exemption under the CWA would not protect a company against liability for personal injury or wrongful death claims, or against prosecution under other federal or state laws. All of the coastal states of the United States in which the Company provides services have adopted similar exemptions, but, several inland states have not. If a court or other applicable authority were to determine that the Company does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing emergency response services, or if the other defenses asserted by the Company and its business segments are rejected, the Company could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages, including damages caused by others, subject to the indemnification provisions and other liability terms and conditions negotiated with its domestic customers. In the international market, the Company does not benefit from the spill response liability protection provided by the CWA and, therefore, is subject to the liability terms and conditions negotiated with its international clients, in addition to any other defenses available to the Company and its business segments. In connection with claims relating to clean-up operations following the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, the responsible party acknowledged and agreed to indemnify and defend ORM and NRC pursuant and subject to certain contractual agreements. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nIf Congress repeals the current $134.0 million cap for non-reclamation liabilities under OPA 90 or otherwise scales back the protections afforded to contractors thereunder, there may be increased exposure for remediation work and the cost for securing\ninsurance for such work may become prohibitively expensive. Without affordable insurance and appropriate legislative regulation limiting liability, drilling, exploration, remediation and further investment in oil and gas exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be discouraged and thus reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company could incur liability in connection with certain obligations relating to the Deepwater Horizon incident. In connection with the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, BP Exploration & Production, Inc. and BP America Production Company engaged the services of ORM and NRC. ORM and NRC were subsequently made defendants in litigation arising from the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident. In connection with claims relating to clean-up operations following the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, the responsible party acknowledged and agreed to indemnify and defend ORM and NRC pursuant and subject to certain contractual agreements and potential limitations. No assurance can be given that the responsible party will honor its obligation to indemnify the Company or J.F. Lehman & Company (\u201cJFL\u201d) under these arrangements. If the responsible party were to fail to honor its obligations, the Company may be faced with significant monetary payments that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact the Company. Media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by the Company, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and the morale of its employees, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased domestic and international laws and regulations may adversely impact the Company, and it may become subject to additional international laws and regulations in the event of high profile incidents, such as the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and technical and operational measures, whether or not in response to specific incidents, may increase the Company\u2019s costs and the costs of its customers\u2019 operations. For instance, on April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deepwater drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, sank after an apparent blowout and fire resulting in a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Macondo well (the \u201cDeepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident\u201d). In response to the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and gas exploration, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and all its relevant various sub-agencies, imposed temporary moratoria on drilling operations, by requiring operators to reapply for exploration plans and drilling permits that had previously been approved, and by adopting numerous new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations regarding offshore operations that are applicable to the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services customers and with which their new applications for exploration plans and drilling permits must prove compliant. Compliance with these new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations have materially increased the cost of drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. New or additional government regulations or laws concerning drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other regions have in the past and could in the future materially increase the cost of drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The changes may influence decisions by customers or other industry participants that could reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services segment.\nRisks from the Company\u2019s international operations. The Company operates vessels and transacts other business worldwide. Its ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company.\nActivity outside the United States involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nUnited States embargoes or restrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide services in foreign countries or cause retaliatory actions by such governments;\n\u2022\na change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nunwaivable, burdensome local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist acts, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for the Company\u2019s services and its profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes;\n\u2022\nimport or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nThe United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 regarding its membership in the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d) in which a majority of the U.K. electorate voted in favor of the British government taking the necessary action for the U.K. to withdraw from the E.U. (the \u201cBrexit\u201d). At this time, it is not certain what steps will need to be taken to facilitate the U.K.'s exit from the E.U. or the length of time that this may take. In particular, on November 3, 2016, the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales (the \u201cHigh Court\u201d) handed down its judgment in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin) (the \u201cBrexit Judgment\u201d). In summary, the High Court held that, as a matter of U.K. constitutional law, the U.K. government does not have the power under the Crown\u2019s prerogative to give the required notice for the U.K. to withdraw from the E.U. without express authority from Parliament. The U.K. government appealed the High Court Brexit Judgment to the Supreme Court. On January 24, 2017, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the High Court. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the Parliament voted on February 1, 2017 in favor of starting the Brexit process.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum and the consequences that may flow from the decision to exit the E.U. Among other things, the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the E.U., along with calls for the governments of other E.U. member states to also consider withdrawal, has caused, and is anticipated to continue to cause, significant new uncertainties and instability in European and global financial markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may affect the Company and its Offshore Marine Services and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing maritime, labor, environmental, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of support vessel services. The impact on the Company\u2019s business of any treaties, laws and regulations with and in the U.K. that replace the existing E.U. counterparts cannot be predicted. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnstable political, military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of Offshore Marine Services\u2019 operations are conducted could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of Offshore Marine Services\u2019 operating revenues resulted from its foreign operations. These operations are subject to risks, including potential vessel seizure, terrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, nationalization of assets, currency restrictions, import or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Economic sanctions or an oil embargo, for example, could have significant impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and, correspondingly, on the Company should Offshore Marine Services operate vessels in a country subject to any sanctions or embargo, or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupts its operations.\nOffshore Marine Services, Inland River Services, Shipping Services, Illinois Corn Processing and Witt O\u2019Brien\u2019s rely on several customers for a significant share of their revenues, the loss of any of which could adversely affect each of their businesses and operating results. The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of oil and gas explorations, development and production companies and government agencies. As of December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s operating revenues. The portion of Offshore Marine Services, Inland River Services, Shipping Services, Illinois Corn Processing\u2019s and Witt O\u2019Brien\u2019s revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of relevant activity by any such customer, the segment\u2019s ability to meet the customer\u2019s needs and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In addition, most of the Company\u2019s contracts with oil and gas customers can be canceled on relatively short notice and do not commit the Company\u2019s customers to acquire specific amounts of services or require the payment of significant liquidated damages upon cancellation. The loss of business from any of the Company\u2019s significant customers could have a material adverse effect such segment\u2019s or the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, to the extent any of the Company\u2019s customers experience an extended period of operating difficulty, its revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely effected.\nConsolidation of the Company\u2019s customer base could adversely affect demand for its services and reduce its revenues. In recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the Company\u2019s services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services\u2019 vessels and Shipping Services\u2019 tankers thereby reducing the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain or replace its offshore support vessels as they age. As of December 31, 2016, the average age of the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services\u2019 vessels, excluding its standby safety and wind farm utility vessels, was approximately eleven years. The Company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately 20 years, the expense (which typically increases with age) necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable. In addition, the Company must maintain its vessels to remain attractive to its customers and comply with regulations; however, the Company may be unable to carry out drydockings of its vessels or may be limited by insufficient shipyard capacity, which could adversely affect its ability to maintain its vessels. In addition, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable the Company to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels.\nAn increase in the supply of vessels, barges or equipment the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the Company\u2019s vessels, barges and equipment. The Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition. Expansion of the supply of vessels, barges and equipment would increase competition in the markets in which the Company operates. The refurbishment of disused or \u201cmothballed\u201d vessels and barges, conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels, barges and equipment could all add vessel, barge and equipment capacity to current worldwide levels. The current oversupply of vessels and equipment capacity in the offshore marine market could lower charter rates for the Company\u2019s Offshore Marine Services business and result in lower operating revenues. A significant increase in vessel, barge and equipment capacity could lower charter rates and result in lower operating revenues.\nIf the Company does not restrict the amount of ownership of its Common Stock by non-U.S. citizens, it could be prohibited from operating offshore support vessels, inland river vessels and barges and tankers in the United States, which would adversely impact its business and operating results. The Company is subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels, tankers and barges used to carry cargo between U.S. ports. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Although SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the Jones Act, a failure to maintain compliance would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and the Company would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during any period in which the Company does not comply or cannot demonstrate to the satisfaction of the relevant governmental authorities the Company\u2019s compliance with the Jones Act. In addition, the Company could be subject to fines and its vessels could be subject to seizure and forfeiture for violations of the Jones Act and the related U.S. vessel documentation laws.\nRepeal, Amendment, Suspension or Non-Enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for Offshore Marine Services, Shipping Services and Inland River Services and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. A substantial portion of the operations of Offshore Marine Services, Shipping Services and Inland River Services are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. There have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future. For example, in a recent congressional review of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial circumstances, several proponents of repealing the Jones Act offered bills to exempt the island from the Jones Act. Although the proposals focused mainly on the delivery of goods and bulk products to Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, and the bills were not passed, there is a risk that such legislation could be reintroduced by the special committee tasked with overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s financial reorganization, which could lead to broader legislation affecting other aspects of the Jones Act.\nRepeal, substantial amendment or waiver of such provisions could significantly adversely affect the Company by, among other things, resulting in additional competition from competitors with lower operating costs, because of their ability to use vessels built in lower-cost foreign shipyards, owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the Company\u2019s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Because foreign vessels may have lower construction costs and operate at significantly lower costs than companies operating in the U.S. coastwise trade, such a change could significantly increase competition in the U.S. coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s investment in Jones Act product carriers could be negatively impacted if the Jones Act is suspended or repealed, or if the price of natural gas increase to levels that reduce the competitiveness of U.S. refineries. The investment in Jones Act product carriers could also be improvident if all existing tankers and tank barges are replaced with additional newly built equipment when they come to the end of their economic life. The repeal on December 18, 2015 of the law restricting the export of U.S. crude oil may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company also has a significant investment in a Company that uses VLGC\u2019s in the foreign Liquefied Petroleum Gas (\u201cLPG\u201d) trade. If the expected rise in production of LPG in the U.S. does not occur, or if most of the production of LPG is consumed domestically in petrochemical plants, or if the price of propane and butane increases to levels that lower demand, this investment may decrease in value.\nRestrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the Company\u2019s vessels could limit its ability to sell off any portion of its business or result in the forfeiture of its vessels. Compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade. If the Company were to seek to sell any portion of its business that owns any of these vessels, it would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of the Company\u2019s business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market. Furthermore, if at any point the Company or any of the entities that directly or indirectly own its vessels cease to satisfy the requirements to be a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act, the Company would become ineligible to operate in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of its vessels.\nSEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws limit the ownership of Common Stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights. Under the Jones Act, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of SEACOR\u2019s capital stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Certain provisions of SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the Common Stock. In addition, the 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 and the 3.0% Convertible Notes due 2028 issued by the Company and the 3.75% Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 issued by SMHI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which, under limited circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s Common Stock, have controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the Jones Act.\nUnder the provisions of SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, the aggregate percentage of ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class of SEACOR\u2019s capital stock (including Common Stock) is limited to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws authorizes SEACOR\u2019s Board of Directors, under certain circumstances, to increase the foregoing permitted percentage to no more than 24%. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation further provides that any issuance or transfer of shares to non-U.S. citizens in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against the Company and that neither the Company nor its transfer agent shall register such purported issuance or transfer of shares to non-U.S. citizens or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise the Company\u2019s remedies. Any such excess shares in the hands of a non-U.S. citizen shall not have any voting or dividend rights and are subject to redemption by the Company in its discretion. The liquidity or market value of the shares of Common Stock may be adversely impacted by such transfer restrictions.\nAs a result of the above provisions, a proposed transferee of the Common Stock that is a non-U.S. citizen may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. The Company, in its discretion, is entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by its Board of Directors in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in its Restated Certificate of Incorporation) by non-U.S. citizens in excess of such maximum permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which may be paid in cash or promissory notes at the discretion of the Company. Such excess shares shall also not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by the Company. As a result of these provisions, a purported\nstockholder who is not a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act may be required to sell its shares of Common Stock at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment in such shares. Further, the Company may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case the Company\u2019s financial condition may be materially weakened.\nSo that the Company may ensure its compliance with the Jones Act, its Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws permit it to require that owners of any shares of its capital stock provide confirmation of their citizenship. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation to the Company, its Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide the Company with certain remedies, including the suspension of the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares and deposit of any such dividends and distributions into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing foreign ownership restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company\u2019s Common Stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nIf non-U.S. citizens own more than 22.5% of SEACOR\u2019s Common Stock, the Company may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and it could be forced to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. SEACOR\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions prohibiting ownership of its Common Stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, in excess of 22.5% of such shares in order to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. In addition, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the Company to redeem such excess shares, including those shares issued upon conversion or exchange of the Company\u2019s convertible notes. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, by cash or promissory notes. However, the Company may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because its operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25.0% of the Common Stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25.0% of any such class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock, or fail to exercise its redemption rights because it is unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, the Company will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S-flag vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by the United States in case of national emergency or national defense need. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 provides that, during a national emergency declared by Presidential proclamation or a period for which the President has proclaimed that the security of the national defense makes it advisable, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition the ownership or use of any vessel owned by U.S. citizens (which includes us) and any vessel under construction in the United States. If any of the Company\u2019s vessels were purchased or chartered by the federal government under this law, it would be entitled to just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a charter, the fair market value of charter hire, but the Company would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages it may suffer. The purchase or charter for an extended period of time by the federal government of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels under this law could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the release or continued use of offshore resources for oil and gas production. Because Offshore Marine Services\u2019 operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, the government\u2019s exercise of authority under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases (for example, due to a serious incident of pollution) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could disrupt operations and expose the Company to liability. The operation of offshore support vessels, tankers, short-sea container, roll-on/roll-off vessels, towboats, tugs and barges is subject to various risks, including catastrophic disaster, adverse weather, mechanical failure and collision. For instance, the Company\u2019s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be adversely affected by weather. The Atlantic Hurricane season runs from June through November. Tropical storms and hurricanes may limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate its vessels in the proximity of storms, reduce oil and gas exploration, development and production activity, could result in the Company incurring additional expenses to secure equipment and facilities and may require the Company to evacuate its vessels, personnel and equipment out of the path of a storm. Additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions, capsizing, grounding, oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors. These risks could endanger the safety of the Company\u2019s personnel, equipment, cargo and other property, as well as the environment. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be held liable for resulting damages,\nincluding loss of revenues from or termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates, increased operating costs, increased governmental regulation and reporting and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and customer relationships. Any such events would likely result in negative publicity for the Company and adversely affect its safety record, which would affect demand for the Company\u2019s services in a competitive industry. In addition, the affected vessels could be removed from service and would then not be available to generate revenues.\nRevenues from Shipping Services could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for domestic refined petroleum products, crude oil or chemical products, or a change in existing methods of delivery. A reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products, crude oil or chemical products, the development of alternative methods of delivery of refined petroleum products or crude oil, or an increase in domestic refining capacity could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nConstruction of additional refined petroleum product, natural gas or crude oil pipelines could have a material adverse effect on Shipping Services\u2019 revenues. Long-haul transportation of refined petroleum products, crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by tanker. Existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in, or do not reach, all of the markets served by Shipping Services\u2019 tankers. The construction and operation of new pipeline segments could have a material adverse effect on Shipping Services\u2019 business.\nThe Company is subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the Company\u2019s operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight, including by the USCG, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), NTSB, EPA, IMO, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the CBP, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\u201cBSEE\u201d) and state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and to regulation by port states and classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping). The Company is also subject to regulation under international treaties, such as SOLAS, MARPOL, and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (\u201cSTCW\u201d). These agencies, organizations, regulations and treaties establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. The CBP and USCG are authorized to inspect vessels at will. The Company has and will continue to spend significant funds to comply with these regulations and treaties. Failure to comply with these regulations and treaties may cause the Company to incur significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations as well as those of individual countries in which the Company operates, relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws that that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into U.S. navigable and other waters or into waters covered by international law or such individual country. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions, or the suspension or termination of the Company\u2019s operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment, increased manning, specific training, or operational changes, and the phase-out of certain product tankers. Some environmental laws impose strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources, which could subject the Company to liability without regard to whether it was negligent or at fault. Under OPA 90, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from the discharge of oil within the navigable waters of the United States and the EEZ around the United States. In addition, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties, criminal liability and costs for natural resource and other damages under other federal and state laws and civil actions. These laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers. Because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and it is the Company\u2019s view that this trend is likely to continue. The Company cannot be certain that existing laws, regulations or standards, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws and regulations and standards will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Regulation of the shipping industry will likely continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company. In addition, a serious marine incident occurring in U.S. waters that results in significant oil pollution could result in additional regulation and lead to strict governmental enforcement or other legal challenges. Additional environmental and other requirements, as well as more stringent enforcement policies, may be adopted that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate, require the Company to incur substantial additional costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. For more information, see Item 1. \u201cGovernment Regulation - Environmental Compliance.\u201d\nInland River Services could experience variation in freight rates. Freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges change. The volume of freight transported on inland river waterways may vary as a result of various factors, such as global economic conditions and business cycles, domestic and international agricultural production\nand demand, and foreign currency exchange rates. Barge participation in the industry can also vary year-to-year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service. Extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact Inland River Services.\nInland River Services\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected by the decline in U.S. grain exports. Inland River Services\u2019 business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including crop harvest yield levels in the United States and abroad, and the demand for grain in the United States. A shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for U.S. grain. Conversely, an abundance of grain overseas can decrease demand for U.S. grain. A decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity, which would likely lower freight rates earned by Inland River Services.\nInland River Services\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected by international economic and political factors. The actions of foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by Inland River Services. Foreign trade agreements and each country\u2019s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for U.S. imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities that Inland River Services transports. National and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or U.S. imports or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates could affect the demand for the transportation of cargoes handled by Inland River Services. These actions or developments could have an adverse impact on Inland River Services.\nInland River Services\u2019 results of operations are affected by seasonal activity. Inland River Services\u2019 business is seasonal, and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower in the first and second quarters of the year and higher in the third and fourth quarters, during the grain harvest.\nInland River Services\u2019 results of operations are affected by adverse weather and river conditions. Weather patterns, such as excessive rainfall or drought, can affect river levels and cause ice conditions during winter months, which can hamper barge navigation. Locks and dams on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes, which may delay barge movements. These conditions could adversely impact Inland River Services.\nThe aging infrastructure on the U.S. Inland River Waterways may lead to increased costs and disruptions in Inland River Services\u2019 operations. Many of the locks and dams on the U.S. Inland River Waterways were built early in the last century, and their age makes them costly to maintain and susceptible to unscheduled maintenance outages. Delays caused by malfunctioning locks and dams could increase Inland River Services\u2019 operating costs and delay the delivery of cargoes. Moreover, in the future, increased user taxes could be imposed to fund necessary infrastructure improvements, and such increases may not be recoverable by Inland River Services through pricing increases. The foregoing risks could also make inland barge transport less competitive than rail.\nInland River Services\u2019 results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations. For the most part, Inland River Services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors. The price of these services can rise when fuel prices escalate and could adversely impact Inland River Services\u2019 results of operations and cash flows.\nThe results of ICP\u2019s ethanol operations are principally reliant on managing the volatility and uncertainty associated with the spread between the prices of corn, natural gas, alcohol, and distillers grains. The results of the Company\u2019s alcohol manufacturing business, ICP, are significantly affected by commodity prices and, in particular, the spread between the input costs of corn and natural gas that ICP purchases compared with the output prices of alcohol and distillers grains that it sells. Market forces that ICP does not control also affect prices, including weather, demand, shortages, export prices, and governmental policies. Market prices for alcohol produced in the U.S. are also influenced by the supply of and demand for imported alcohol. Imported alcohol, including sugarcane alcohol imported from Brazil also competes with ICP\u2019s domestic alcohol production. Consequently, ICP\u2019s operating results may fluctuate substantially with increases in corn or natural gas input prices or decreases in alcohol, and distillers grains and, thus, ICP\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by such activity. Narrow spreads between alcohol and corn prices would adversely affect ICP\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance and excise tax risks associated with operations involving alcohol. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries, ICP and Gateway Terminals LLC, are involved in the production, shipment and sale of alcohol products for a variety of industrial and non-industrial uses, with customers located in the United States and elsewhere. Such activities fall within the jurisdiction of certain alcohol control and excise taxation agencies, most notably including a Bureau within the Treasury Department - the Alcohol & Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d). Failure to adhere to the regulations and policies of TTB and similar state regulatory agencies could expose these subsidiaries to excise tax liabilities arising from the production, shipment, or sale of alcohol. In addition, failure to adhere to such regulations and policies could give rise to adverse enforcement action by TTB and similar state regulatory agencies. Remedies that such government agencies might seek to pursue as a result of compliance failures could include: the power to suspend or revoke government approvals necessary to continue producing, shipping, or selling alcohol; the assessment of excise taxes, interest, and tax penalties; and criminal prosecution of the subsidiaries and/or their officials. Such remedies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses, risks may arise for which the Company may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability. Further, to the extent the proceeds from insurance are not sufficient to repair or replace a damaged asset, the Company would be required to expend funds to supplement the insurance and in certain circumstances may decide that such expenditures are not justified, which, in either case, could adversely affect its liquidity and ability to grow.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s Seassurance business. The Company\u2019s subsidiary, Seassurance Ltd., provides insurance-related marine transportation compliance products, including Certificates of Financial Responsibility (\u201cCOFRs\u201d) and the provision of International Carrier Bonds (\u201cICBs\u201d), primarily to owners and operators of vessels calling at ports in the United States and traversing U.S. waters. Guarantees to support COFRs are provided to enable customers to demonstrate financial security required by U.S. Coast Guard regulations for such vessels to trade in U.S. waters. As provider of these guarantees, Seassurance undertakes that any liabilities of the customer under the OPA 90 and/or CERCLA will be satisfied up to the liability limits applicable to the vessel under these statutes. Seassurance typically acquires rights of recovery from the insurer for payments made and exposure under the guarantees, subject to a retained risk of $3.0 million in respect of each incident. Although shipowners\u2019 liabilities under OPA and CERCLA traditionally have been satisfied by P&I insurers, and guarantees to support COFRs have rarely, if ever, been called upon, the risk exists that such liabilities may not be met by P&I insurers and, thus, could exceed the $3.0 million level of retained risk. There is also a risk of multiple exposures for Seassurance if a series of such incidents were to occur. Effective June 30, 2016, the Company ceased issuing new COFR guarantees. All outstanding COFR guarantees will expire on or before June 30, 2017.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks. The Company is exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks and although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For instance, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar results in higher prices for U.S. exports, which may adversely affect Inland River Services, Shipping Services and ICP\u2019s operating results. The Company has, and anticipates that it will continue to have, contracts denominated in foreign currencies. It is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods, and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could give rise to reduced prices from shipyards and incentivize additional investment in new equipment in the shipping and offshore marine services markets notwithstanding the current state of such markets. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that the Company undertakes. The Company holds a large proportion of its net assets in cash equivalents and short-term investments, including a variety of public and private debt and equity instruments. Such investments subject the Company to risks generally inherent in the capital markets. Given the relatively high proportion of the Company\u2019s liquid assets relative to its overall size, its financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected by the results of the Company\u2019s capital management and investment activities and the risks associated with those activities. Volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty also increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the Company\u2019s debt and equity instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. In addition, changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Specifically, rising interest rates, including a potential rapid rise in interest rates, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on its business. Attracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of the Company\u2019s business segments is an important factor in its future success. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive and the Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key members of our management, the loss of whom could disrupt our business operations. The Company depends to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of its executive officers and key management personnel. The Company does not maintain key-man insurance. The loss of services of one or more of the Company\u2019s executive officers or key management personnel could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure to successfully complete construction or conversion of the Company\u2019s vessels, repairs, maintenance or routine drydockings on schedule and on budget could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, the Company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or\nconvert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions. The Company also routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Construction and conversion projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in either construction or drydockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction, conversion or undergoing drydockings. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction, conversion or retrofit could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs the markets recover or the Company changes its marketing strategies or for other reasons, the Company may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously cold-stacked vessels to class. In response to the decrease in demand stemming from lower oil and natural gas prices, the Company has cold-stacked a number of its offshore support vessels. As of December 31, 2016, 49 of 133 owned and leased-in offshore support vessels were cold-stacked worldwide, and eight had been retired and removed from service. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to quickly bring these offshore support vessels back into service or that the cost of doing so would not be significant. Cold-stacked vessels are not always maintained with the same diligence as Offshore Marine Services marketed fleet. As a result, and depending on the length of time the offshore support vessels are cold-stacked, the Company could incur deferred drydocking costs for regulatory recertification to return these vessels to active service and may incur costs to hire and train mariners to operate such vessels. These costs are difficult to estimate and could be substantial. Delay in reactivating cold-stacked offshore support vessels and the costs and other expenses related to the reactivation of cold-stacked offshore support vessels could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nA violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations. In order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, the Company is subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. The Company has adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, the Company does business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. The Company\u2019s personnel and intermediaries, including its local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future. As a result, the Company faces the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of its employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to the Company\u2019s control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which the Company may be subject. Any allegation or determination that the Company has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn outbreak of any contagious disease, such as Ebola, H1N1 Flu or the Zika Virus , may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations. The outbreak of diseases, such as Ebola, H1N1 Flu, commonly referred to as Swine Flu, or the Zika Virus, has in the past curtailed and may in the future curtail travel to and from certain countries, or geographic regions. Restrictions on travel to and from these countries or other regions due to additional incidences for diseases, such as Swine Flu and other communicable diseases, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with climate change and environmental regulations. Governments around the world have, in recent years, placed increasing attention on matters affecting the environment and this could lead to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that in turn could result in a reduction in demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel. Governments could also pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and therefore the services provided by the Company. Alternatively, changes in U.S. law permitting additional drilling on federal lands could divert capital from offshore exploration. In addition, new environmental or emissions control laws or regulations may require an increase in the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or in the Company\u2019s capital spending for additional equipment or personnel to comply with such requirements and could also result in a reduction in revenues due to downtime required for the installation of such equipment. Such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, as well as investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of its common stock. The Company is required to report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K management\u2019s assessment of the effectives of such controls. In addition, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is also required to attest to, and report on, the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting.\nAs described in Part II Item 9A \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\u201d in connection with its evaluation, management identified material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting related to the (i) review and approval of manual journal entries made to the Company\u2019s general ledger and (ii) review and documentation of assumptions, data and calculations used in the Company\u2019s assessment of potential impairments of vessels, goodwill and other-than-temporary impairments of its equity method investments.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of such material weakness, management concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2016.\nManagement has begun to develop a remediation plan but has not finalized the plan. There can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented or whether the remediation efforts will be successful. As management continues to evaluate and work to improve the Company\u2019s internal controls, management may determine to take additional measures to address these material weaknesses or determine to modify its remediation plan.\nUntil the remediation plan is fully implemented, management will continue to devote time and attention to these efforts. If the Company does not complete the remediation of the material weaknesses in a timely fashion, or at all, or if the remediation plan is inadequate, there will be an increased risk that the Company will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. The existence of a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal controls could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any such financing. The identification of the material weakness could also cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements and could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.\nThe Company relies on information technology, and if it is unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. The Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to capture knowledge of its business; to coordinate its business across its operation bases; and to communicate within the Company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. The Company\u2019s information technology systems are becoming increasingly integrated, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and its business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, and data loss and corruption. There is no assurance that the Company will not experience these service interruptions or cyber-attacks in the future. Further, as the methods of cyber attacks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.\nSignificant exercises of stock options or conversion of convertible debt could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 17,400,705 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding; however, the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved for issuance under the Company\u2019s stock plans, including upon the exercise of options issued under such plans, or shares issuable upon the exchange or conversion of the Company\u2019s convertible debt. The exercise of outstanding options, the issuance of shares reserved for issuance under the Company\u2019s Stock Plans and the conversion of convertible debt instruments could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, will reduce the percentage of Common Stock held by the Company\u2019s current stockholders and may cause its current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to access capital markets could be limited. From time to time, the Company may need to access the capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets for long-term financing could be limited by among other things, oil and gas prices, its existing capital structure, its credit ratings and the health of the shipping, response and overall oil and gas industry. In addition, many of the factors that affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of the Company\u2019s control. To the extent required to do so, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to access to the capital markets on acceptable terms.", "PERMNO": 78137, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "CKH"}
