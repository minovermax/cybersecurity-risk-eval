{"cik": "1606745", "company": "Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nThe combined financial information of our company, for the periods prior to the Trip Spin-Off, is not necessarily representative of our future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows nor does it reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand-alone company during the periods presented.\nBecause the historical combined financial information of our company included in these financial statements includes the results of our legacy business and because such financial information largely reflects the historical results of BuySeasons, it is not representative of our future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor does it reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand-alone company, pursuing independent strategies, during the periods presented, especially in light of the fact that the future results of operations will be significantly comprised of the results of TripAdvisor.\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including to make debt service payments under the Margin Loan Agreements (as defined below) and any other credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly owned subsidiary BuySeasons, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates from its operating activities.\nTripAdvisor generated $387 million, $349 million and $239 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. TripAdvisor uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates unless TripAdvisor declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Historically, TripAdvisor has not paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in TripAdvisor\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that TripAdvisor will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nWe have no operating history as a separate company upon which you can evaluate our performance.\nWe do not have an operating history as a separate public company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business strategy will be successful on a long-term basis. We may not be able to grow our businesses as planned and may not be profitable.\nI-11\nIf TripAdvisor\u2019s spin-off from Expedia, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TripAdvisor could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nAs a condition to the completion of TripAdvisor\u2019s spin-off from Expedia, Expedia obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS, along with an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Expedia Board of Directors regarding the qualification of the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cthe Code\u201d). The IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions as well as the accuracy of certain representations, statements and undertakings that Expedia and TripAdvisor made to the IRS and to counsel. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if TripAdvisor or Expedia breaches any of the covenants, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel may be invalid.\nMoreover, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether TripAdvisor\u2019s spin-off from Expedia qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS private letter ruling or on which the opinion of counsel was based is false or has been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by any IRS ruling.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement between TripAdvisor and Expedia, TripAdvisor is generally required to indemnify Expedia for any taxes resulting from the spin-off (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) any act or failure to act by TripAdvisor described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement, (ii) any acquisition of TripAdvisor\u2019s equity securities or assets or those of a member of its group, or (iii) any failure of the representations with respect to TripAdvisor or any member of its group to be true or any breach by TripAdvisor or any member of its group of any covenant, in each case, which is contained in the separation documents or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel.\nFactors Relating to Our Businesses\nIf TripAdvisor is unable to continue to increase visitors to its websites and to cost-effectively convert these visitors into repeat users or contributors, its advertising revenue could decline.\nThe primary asset that TripAdvisor uses to attract visitors to its websites and convert these visitors into repeat users is TripAdvisor\u2019s continued ability to collect, create, organize and distribute high-quality, commercially valuable content that meets their specific interests and enables them to share and interact with the content and supporting communities. There can be no assurances that TripAdvisor will continue to obtain content in a cost-effective manner or in a manner that meets rapidly changing consumer demand. Any failure to obtain such content or organize and distribute such content in a manner that will engage users, or a failure to provide products that are perceived as useful, reliable and trustworthy, could adversely affect user experiences and reduce traffic driven to its websites, which would make TripAdvisor\u2019s websites less attractive to advertisers. Any change in the cost structure pursuant to which TripAdvisor obtains its content, or in travelers\u2019 relative appreciation of user-based versus expert content or our user-based content versus other sites\u2019 user-based content, could also reduce traffic driven to TripAdvisor\u2019s websites, which would negatively impact its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor derives substantially all of its revenue from advertising and any significant reduction in spending by its advertisers could harm its business.\nTripAdvisor derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. While TripAdvisor enters into master advertising contracts with its partners, these agreements generally address matters such as privacy and compliance, payment terms and\nI-12\nconditions, termination and indemnities. Most of TripAdvisor\u2019s click-based advertising contracts can be terminated by its partners at will or on short notice. TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to grow advertising revenue with its existing or new advertising partners is dependent in large part on its ability to generate revenue for them. Advertisers will not continue to do business with TripAdvisor if their investment in such advertising does not generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis, or if it does not deliver advertisements in an effective manner. If TripAdvisor is unable to provide value to its advertisers, they will likely stop placing ads on its websites, which would harm our financial condition and business. In addition, we cannot guarantee that TripAdvisor\u2019s current advertisers will fulfill their obligations under existing contracts, continue to advertise beyond the terms of existing contracts or enter into any additional contracts with it.\nClick-based advertising accounts for the majority of TripAdvisor\u2019s advertising revenue. Any changes TripAdvisor makes to its business model may impact its advertising revenue in ways that it does not expect. If TripAdvisor\u2019s partners do not receive the benefits they expect from their advertising spend with it, they may reduce their spending. In addition, if new, more effective advertising models were to emerge, there can be no assurance that TripAdvisor would have the ability to offer these models, or offer them in an effective manner.\nFurthermore, TripAdvisor\u2019s cost-per-click (\u201cCPC\u201d) pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. If its large advertisers become less competitive with each other, merge with each other or with its competitors, focus more on per-click profit than on traffic volume, or are able to reduce CPCs, this could have an adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s click-based advertising revenue which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpenditures by advertisers also tend to be cyclical, subject to variation based on budgetary constraints, project cancellation or delay, and to reflect overall economic conditions and buying patterns. If TripAdvisor is unable to generate advertising revenue due to factors outside of its control, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 businesses could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation.\nOur subsidiaries rely heavily on Internet search engines such as Google on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, including through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate traffic to their websites. Our subsidiaries obtain a significant amount of traffic via search engines and, therefore, utilize techniques such as search engine optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) and search engine marketing (\u201cSEM\u201d) to improve their placement in relevant search queries. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our subsidiaries\u2019 websites can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our subsidiaries\u2019 websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects our subsidiaries\u2019 paid or unpaid search ranking, or if competitive dynamics impact the effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. Furthermore, our subsidiaries\u2019 failure to successfully manage their SEO and SEM strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to their websites, as well as increased costs if our subsidiaries were to replace free traffic with paid traffic.\nIn addition, to the extent that Google (including Google + Local and Google Hotel Finder) and Bing (including Bing Travel), or other leading search or metasearch engines that have a significant presence in TripAdvisor\u2019s key markets, disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities, or refer those leads to suppliers directly, or to other favored partners, there could be a material adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s business and financial performance. For example, during 2011, Google completed its acquisition of flight search technology company ITA Software and separately made changes to its hotel search results, including both expanding and promoting the use of Google + Local. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on TripAdvisor\u2019s search traffic, whether on desktop, tablet or mobile devices, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nI-13\nTripAdvisor relies on a relatively small number of significant advertisers and any reduction in spending by or loss of those advertisers could seriously harm its business.\nTripAdvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of significant advertisers. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014, TripAdvisor\u2019s two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries), accounted for a combined 46% of its total revenue. If any of its significant advertisers were to cease or significantly curtail advertising on TripAdvisor\u2019s websites, TripAdvisor could experience a rapid decline in its revenue over a relatively short period of time.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s success depends upon the acceptance, and successful measurement, of online advertising as an alternative to offline advertising.\nThe long-term growth of TripAdvisor\u2019s business will depend heavily on the continued acceptance of online advertising as an alternative or supplement to offline advertising and the increase in the percentage of the advertising market allocated to online advertising which may not happen in a manner or to the extent that it currently expects. TripAdvisor competes with traditional media for advertising dollars, in addition to websites with higher levels of traffic. If online advertising ceases to be an acceptable alternative or supplement to offline advertising then its business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted.\nBecause the online marketing industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, it uses different methods than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness. The adoption of Internet advertising, particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising, requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and evaluating new advertising and marketing technologies and services. As a result, TripAdvisor is continually evaluating changes to aspects of its business model to keep pace with the expectations of users and advertisers, and these changes may not yield the benefits it expects. In particular, it is dependent on its clients\u2019 adoption of new metrics to measure the success of online marketing campaigns.\nIn addition, if advertisers materially change their transaction attribution models or their return on investment calculations and/or increase their return on investment targets with respect to online advertising in general, or TripAdvisor traffic in particular, they might reduce the prices they are willing to pay for TripAdvisor\u2019s advertising products, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in the use of devices other than personal computers may negatively affect TripAdvisor\u2019s revenue and financial results.\nIn general, TripAdvisor\u2019s content was originally designed for users accessing the Internet on a desktop or laptop computer. The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, such as mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles and television set top devices, has increased substantially in the last few years and TripAdvisor anticipates that the rate of use of these computing devices will continue to grow. The lower resolution, functionality and memory associated with some of these alternative devices make the use of TripAdvisor\u2019s products and services through such devices much more difficult and versions of its products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users. Although the substantial majority of users of alternative computing devices also access and engage with TripAdvisor\u2019s websites on personal computers and/or tablets, TripAdvisor\u2019s users could decide to increasingly access its products primarily through alternative computing devices. TripAdvisor has developed services and applications to address limitations of these smaller devices and its advertising revenue continues to grow, however, TripAdvisor monetizes users of alternative computing devices at a lower rate compared to users who access its websites through personal computers.\nDeclines or disruptions in the economy in general and the travel industry in particular could adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance are affected by the health of the global economy generally as well as the worldwide travel industry in particular. Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business\nI-14\ndiscretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns. Decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services, thereby causing a reduction in revenue.\nThe global economy may be adversely impacted by a number of negative economic developments including defaults on government debt, significant increases in fuel and energy costs, tax increases and other matters that could reduce discretionary spending, continued tightening of credit markets, further declines in consumer confidence, and policy missteps. These conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor relies on the value of its brand and consumer trust in its brand. If TripAdvisor is not able to maintain and enhance its brand, or if events occur that damage its reputation and brand, TripAdvisor\u2019s business may be harmed.\nTripAdvisor believes that the TripAdvisor brand has contributed significantly to its success and that maintaining and enhancing its brand is critical to expanding its base of users, creating content and attracting advertisers. As a result, TripAdvisor invests significantly in brand marketing including, most recently, television. TripAdvisor expects these investments to continue, or even increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including increased spending from competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where its brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing, and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines as destination sites for travelers. Such efforts may not maintain or enhance consumer awareness of its brands and, even if TripAdvisor is successful in its branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective or as efficient as they have been historically. If TripAdvisor is unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of its brands or to generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor receives significant media coverage in its various geographic markets. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, TripAdvisor\u2019s privacy practices, product changes, the accuracy of user-generated content, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity could adversely affect its reputation with its site users and its advertisers. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of TripAdvisor\u2019s user base and result in decreased revenue, which could adversely affect its business and financial results.\nIntense competition could reduce TripAdvisor\u2019s market share and harm its financial performance.\nThe market for the services TripAdvisor offers is intensely competitive. TripAdvisor faces competition from a number of different sources and many of its competitors have significantly greater and more diversified resources than TripAdvisor does and may be able to leverage other aspects of their business to enable them to compete more effectively against it. More specifically:\n\u00b7\nTripAdvisor currently faces competition from travel service providers such as major hotel companies, airlines and rental car companies, many of which have their own websites to which they drive business. For example, several major hotel companies launched an online hotel reservation service with a stated goal of driving consumers directly to their brand websites thereby reducing the share received by online travel agents. They may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rates, better room availability or additional features or amenities through this reservation service than are available through services like TripAdvisor\u2019s.\n\u00b7\nTripAdvisor currently faces competition from online travel agents, such as Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries), and this competition may increase to the extent that these online travel agents accumulate and develop a comprehensive offering of travel-related reviews and resources. The barriers to entry for these companies may be limited given their access to travel-related information and relationships with consumers.\n\u00b7\nTripAdvisor faces increased competition from the large search engines and social networking sites, companies, such as Google and Facebook, or other companies, which competition will only increase should they chose to compete more directly with it in the travel review space, and create commercially valuable online content at significant scale. For example, Google + Local, with its aggregated reviews and local recommendations, competes with TripAdvisor and Google\u2019s access to more comprehensive data regarding\nI-15\nuser search queries through its search algorithms gives it a significant competitive advantage over other companies in the industry, including TripAdvisor. In addition, if significant numbers of users adopt Facebook\u2019s newly released Graph Search to get travel recommendations, it could have the effect of reducing traffic and user engagement on TripAdvisor.\n\u00b7\nTripAdvisor also faces competition from travel agencies, wholesalers and travel operators as well as operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo, Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, TripAdvisor competes with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities.\n\u00b7\nFor TripAdvisor\u2019s vacation rental business, TripAdvisor also faces competition from several companies, including HomeAway and Airbnb, some of whom have a larger inventory of rooms available than TripAdvisor does.\n\u00b7\nFor TripAdvisor\u2019s restaurant reservation and attractions business, the competition is not as consolidated as it is for other areas of its business; however, TripAdvisor faces competition from certain companies like OpenTable in the United States.\nMany of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources compared to it and have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic as well as large client bases. TripAdvisor expects to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the travel advertising market. Certain of the companies it does business with, including some of its click-based advertising partners, are also its competitors. The consolidation of TripAdvisor\u2019s competitors and partners, including Expedia (through its investment in Trivago) and Priceline (through its acquisition of Kayak and OpenTable), may affect its relative competitiveness and its partner relationships. Competition and consolidation could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on TripAdvisor\u2019s advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to its websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on its websites. For example, Google (through its launch of Google Hotel Finder, evolution and expansion of Google + Local and preferred top placement of Places results in Google organic travel search results) and Microsoft\u2019s Bing (through its launch of Bing Travel), have each taken steps to appeal more directly to travel customers, which could lead to diversion of customer traffic to their own websites or those of a favored partner, or undermine TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost, or at all. Competition in TripAdvisor\u2019s industry may result in pricing pressure, loss of market share or decreased member engagement, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor is regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nTripAdvisor is regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using its platforms, and other matters. The sale of hardware products also exposes TripAdvisor to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. In addition, TripAdvisor\u2019s businesses face intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes it to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit its ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on TripAdvisor because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for TripAdvisor\u2019s pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect TripAdvisor\u2019s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing TripAdvisor from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in TripAdvisor\u2019s business practices\nI-16\nor product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nTripAdvisor may be subject to claims that it violated intellectual property rights of others, which claims are extremely costly to defend and could require it to pay significant damages and limit its ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. TripAdvisor has received in the past, and may in the future receive, notices that claim it has misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claim against TripAdvisor, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject TripAdvisor to significant liability for damages and could result in TripAdvisor having to stop using technology or content found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. TripAdvisor might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, TripAdvisor could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase its operating expenses. TripAdvisor may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, or content, which could require significant effort and expense and make it less competitive in the relevant market. Any of these results could harm our business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor is dependent upon the quality of traffic in its network to provide value to online advertisers, and any failure in its quality control could have a material adverse effect on the value of its websites to its advertisers and adversely affect its revenue.\nTripAdvisor uses technology and processes to monitor the quality of and to identify any anomalous metrics associated with, the Internet traffic that it delivers to online advertisers. These metrics may be indicative of low quality clicks such as non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the mechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. Even with such monitoring in place, there is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that online advertisers deem to be invalid, will be delivered to such online advertisers. As a result, TripAdvisor may be required to credit amounts owed to it by its advertisers. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to TripAdvisor\u2019s relationships with advertisers, and could adversely affect its advertising pricing and revenue.\nTripAdvisor relies on assumptions and estimates and data from third parties to calculate certain of its key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm TripAdvisor\u2019s reputation and negatively affect our business.\nCertain key metrics, such as the number of TripAdvisor\u2019s active users, unique visitors, total traffic and number of reviews and opinions, are calculated, in some cases, using internal company data and, in other cases, relying on data from third parties. While these numbers are based on what TripAdvisor believes to be reasonable calculations for the applicable periods of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and user engagement across its large user base around the world. For example, a single person or user may have multiple accounts or browse the internet on multiple browsers, some mobile applications automatically contact TripAdvisor\u2019s servers for regular updates with no user action and TripAdvisor is not able to capture user information on all of its platforms. As such, the calculations of TripAdvisor\u2019s active users and unique visitors may not accurately reflect the number of people actually using its platforms. In addition, TripAdvisor\u2019s measures of user growth and user engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similar metrics of its competitors due to differences in methodologies utilized by TripAdvisor and the third parties for which it relies on this data.\nTripAdvisor is continually seeking to improve its ability to estimate these key metrics. TripAdvisor regularly reviews and adjusts its processes for calculating internal metrics to improve their accuracy. If TripAdvisor\u2019s users, advertisers, partners and shareholders do not perceive its metrics to be accurate representations or if TripAdvisor discovers material inaccuracies in its user metrics, its reputation may be harmed. In which case, users may not use TripAdvisor\u2019s\nI-17\nproducts and services and advertisers and partners may be less willing to allocate their budgets to its products and services which could negatively affect TripAdvisor\u2019s business and operating results.\nOur subsidiaries rely on information technology to operate their business and maintain competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems. As their operations grow in size and scope, they must continuously improve and upgrade their systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of their systems and infrastructure. Our subsidiaries\u2019 future success also depends on their ability to adapt their services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of their services in response to competitive service and product offerings. The emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter their markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as they would like or in a cost-effective manner.\nIf TripAdvisor does not continue to innovate and provide tools and services that are useful to travelers, it may not remain competitive, and its business and financial performance could suffer.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s success depends in part on continued innovation to provide features and services that make its websites and smartphone and tablet computing applications useful for travelers. Its competitors are continually developing innovations in online travel-related services and features. As a result, TripAdvisor is continually working to improve its business model and user experience in order to drive user traffic and conversion dates. TripAdvisor can give no assurances that the changes it makes will yield the benefits it expects and will not have adverse impacts that TripAdvisor did not anticipate. If TripAdvisor is unable to continue offering innovative products and services and quality features that travelers want to use, existing users may become dissatisfied and use a competitor\u2019s offerings and, it may be unable to attract additional users, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nNew technologies could block TripAdvisor\u2019s ads, which would harm its business.\nTripAdvisor derives most of its revenue from fees paid to it by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for its users. Technologies have been developed that can block the display of online ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of some web-based advertising products. As a result, these technologies and tools could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s culture emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes user engagement over short-term financial results.\nTripAdvisor has a culture that encourages rapid development and release of new and improved products, which may at times result in unintended consequences or decisions that are poorly received by users or advertisers. TripAdvisor\u2019s culture also prioritizes user engagement, or website \u201cstickiness,\u201d over short-term financial results. TripAdvisor has taken actions in the past and may continue to make product decisions going forward that have the effect of reducing its short-term revenue or profitability if it believes that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience and/or conversion rates and CPC pricing, and will thereby improve its financial performance over the long-term. The short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than TripAdvisor anticipates. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that TripAdvisor expects, in which case its user growth and engagement, its relationships with users and advertisers, and its business and results of operations could be harmed.\nI-18\nThe online vacation rental market is rapidly evolving and if TripAdvisor fails to predict the manner in which the market develops, its business and prospects may suffer.\nTripAdvisor offers vacation rental services through its U.S.-based FlipKey and Vacation Home Rentals and European-based Holiday Lettings and Niumba. The online vacation rental market is relatively new and rapidly evolving in many respects, including acceptance of the business model by travelers, property owners and property managers; from a business and marketing perspective as well as the regulatory environment. TripAdvisor operates in various disparate jurisdictions and markets and has limited insight into trends that may develop in those markets and may affect its business. Since TripAdvisor began offering such services, there have been and continue to be significant business, marketing and regulatory developments. Operating in new and untested jurisdictions requires significant management attention and financial resources. TripAdvisor cannot assure that its expansion efforts will be successful, and the investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth may not produce the desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nIf TripAdvisor fails to attract and maintain a critical mass of vacation rental listings and travelers, its vacation rental marketplaces will become less valuable and this may have a negative impact on its business.\nIn TripAdvisor\u2019s vacation rental business, revenue is generated when owners or managers of vacation rental properties pay TripAdvisor fees to list and market vacation rental properties to users who visit the websites comprising its marketplace, owners and/or travelers pay it fees upon booking a transaction and property managers pay TripAdvisor fees for email and telephone leads from potential travelers. As a result, TripAdvisor\u2019s success in this area primarily depends on its ability to attract owners, managers, travelers and advertisers to its marketplace. If property owners and managers do not perceive the benefits of marketing their properties through TripAdvisor\u2019s websites, or elect to list them with a competitor instead of listing with TripAdvisor, its volume of new listings and listing renewals may suffer. As a result, TripAdvisor may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of vacation properties to attract travelers to its websites. A larger competitor already exists in the vacation rental space, with significantly more users and listed properties, and new competitors with significant financial resources are continually emerging.\nEach of our company and TripAdvisor may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nIn connection with the Trip Spin-Off, we have outstanding borrowings of $404 million at December 31, 2014, including PIK interest, under two margin loan agreements (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreements\u201d) entered into by our bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cTripSPV\u201d). Borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreements are guaranteed solely by our company and secured by our ownership interest in TripAdvisor. All of our equity interests in TripAdvisor will be held through TripSPV. Because our primary asset consists of our equity interests in TripAdvisor and the Margin Loan Agreements prohibit, with limited exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by TripSPV, our company is very limited in its ability to incur additional financing (other than a contingent line of credit provided to our company by Liberty, pursuant to which our company is able to borrow up to $200 million under limited circumstances (the \u201cLiberty Line of Credit\u201d), and our cash reserves and limited operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, the Margin Loan Agreements provide that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loans will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest and, during approximately the first two years of the term of the Margin Loan Agreements, a prepayment premium. If the company or TripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged stock of TripAdvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition as well as our access to capital on a going forward basis.\nTripAdvisor is party to a term loan with a remaining principal of $300 million, as well as a revolving credit facility of $200 million at December 31, 2014. These arrangements may limit TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to secure significant additional financing in the future on favorable terms, and its cash reserves and operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy its financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time. The ability of TripAdvisor to secure additional\nI-19\nfinancing and satisfy its financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon its future operating performance.\nIn addition, the availability of capital for our company and TripAdvisor will be subject to prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, all of which are beyond the control of our company and TripAdvisor. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms, if at all, to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, TripAdvisor may be unable to issue or develop new or enhanced existing services, and both our company and TripAdvisor may be unable to complete acquisitions, repurchase equity or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company and TripAdvisor. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nFurther, if TripAdvisor raises additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, including as a result of the lack of availability of debt financing, our company may experience significant dilution.\nTripAdvisor is also accumulating a greater portion of its cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously. The repatriation of such funds for use in the United States, including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or debt refinancings, may result in additional U.S. income tax expense and higher cost for such capital.\nEach of our company and TripAdvisor has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the Trip Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which TripSPV has outstanding $404 million at December 31, 2014, including PIK interest. In addition, TripAdvisor is party to its own term loan with a remaining principal of $300 million and $200 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. As a result of this significant indebtedness, each company may:\n\u00b7\nExperience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nBe required to dedicate a substantial portion of its available cash to make payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes (and we further note that, in the case of our company, we have a limited amount of cash and do not have access to the cash of TripAdvisor as a result of the significant non-controlling interest in TripAdvisor);\n\u00b7\nBe handicapped in its ability to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u00b7\nBe limited in its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u00b7\nPossibly be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nBe exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of its indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nBe limited in its ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that it finds acceptable.\nIn addition, it is possible that each company may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of TripAdvisor\u2019s outstanding indebtedness permit it to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. In addition, TripSPV\nI-20\nis prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness under the Margin Loan Agreements, and we expect our company to have limited capacity to incur indebtedness outside of TripSPV (other than with respect to the Liberty Line of Credit, which is only available under limited circumstances).\nAlthough TripAdvisor has substantial cash flow from operations with which it may service its debt obligations, we have limited sources of cash and liquidity. Our initial cash balance is expected to enable us to fund our parent level operating expenses and debt service obligations for the next five years; however, we cannot assure you that we will not experience unexpected expenses or that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and service our direct debt obligations during those five years or thereafter. For additional information about our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\u201d and \u201cWe do not have access to the cash that TripAdvisor generates from its operating activities.\u201d above. A description of TripAdvisor\u2019s debt service obligations can be found in footnote 7 (Debt) to the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of TripAdvisor, Inc. for the period ended December 31, 2014 included herein under \u201cFinancials Statements.\u201d\nThe agreements that govern TripAdvisor\u2019s credit facility contain various covenants that limit its discretion in the operation of its businesses and require it to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on TripAdvisor. In addition, the Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants that will restrict the activities of TripSPV.\nTripAdvisor is party to a credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $200 million and a term of five years, as well as a five-year term loan with an original principal of $400 million term loan to its wholly-owned subsidiary, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC. The agreements that govern the term loan and revolving credit facility contain various covenants, including those that limit TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nIncur indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nPay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock;\n\u00b7\nEnter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;\n\u00b7\nEnter into secured financing arrangements;\n\u00b7\nEnter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u00b7\nEnter into unrelated businesses.\nThese covenants may limit TripAdvisor\u2019s ability to optimally operate its business. In addition, TripAdvisor\u2019s term loan and revolving credit facility require that it meets certain financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the Trip Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which we borrowed $404 million, including PIK interest. The Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nIncur indebtedness by TripSPV;\n\u00b7\nEnter into financing arrangements with respect to the stock of TripAdvisor; and\n\u00b7\nCause TripSPV to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock or other shares of TripAdvisor.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the Margin Loan Agreements provide that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loans to certain specified amounts will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest and, during approximately the first two years of the term of the Margin Loan Agreements, a prepayment premium, and if the company or TripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the\nI-21\npledged stock of TripAdvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of TripAdvisor\u2019s term loan and credit facility or the Margin Loan Agreements may result in an event of default under the agreements governing such facilities. Such default may allow the applicable creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply TripAdvisor with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings). For additional information regarding the potential impact of the restrictions in these debt arrangements, see \u201cEach of our company and TripAdvisor may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\u201d\nIf TripAdvisor fails to manage its growth effectively, its brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.\nTripAdvisor has experienced rapid growth in its headcount and operations, which places substantial demands on management and its operational infrastructure. TripAdvisor continues to make substantial investments in its technology, sales and marketing and community management organizations. As TripAdvisor continues to grow, it must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of its company culture. If TripAdvisor does not manage the growth of its business and operations effectively, the quality of its platform and efficiency of its operations could suffer, which could harm its brand, results of operations and business.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s international operations involve additional risks and its exposure to these risks will increase as its business expands globally.\nTripAdvisor operates in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intends to continue to expand its international operations. To achieve widespread acceptance in new countries and markets, TripAdvisor must continue to tailor its services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets, which can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Failure to adapt practices and models effectively to each country into which TripAdvisor expands could slow its international growth.\nTripAdvisor has businesses operating in China, which create particular risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in China. The laws and regulations of China restrict foreign investment in areas including air-ticketing and travel agency services, Internet content provision, mobile communication and related businesses. Although TripAdvisor has established effective control of its Chinese businesses through a series of agreements, future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict its ability to operate or restructure these businesses or to engage in strategic transactions. The success of these businesses, and of any future investments in China, is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application, development and interpretation of China\u2019s laws and regulations.\nOther risks faced by TripAdvisor as a result of its international operations, including its operations in China, include:\n\u00b7\nPolitical instability;\n\u00b7\nThreatened or actual acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nRegulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;\n\u00b7\nAbility to comply with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nDiminished ability to legally enforce contractual rights;\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk and limits on enforceability of intellectual property rights;\nI-22\n\u00b7\nPossible preferences by local populations for local providers;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on, or adverse consequences related to, the withdrawal of non-U.S. investment and earnings;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on repatriation of cash as well as restrictions on investments in operations in certain countries;\n\u00b7\nFinancial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies, as well as currency exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nSlower adoption of the Internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in certain of those markets as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in managing staff and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences; and\n\u00b7\nUncertainty regarding liability for services, content and intellectual property rights, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent.\nThe loss of one or more of TripAdvisor\u2019s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm TripAdvisor\u2019s business.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s future success depends upon the continued contributions of its senior corporate management and other key employees. In particular, the contributions of Stephen Kaufer, TripAdvisor\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, are critical to its overall management. TripAdvisor cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of these individuals, and the loss of one or more of its key personnel could seriously harm its business. TripAdvisor does not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, competition remains intense for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of TripAdvisor\u2019s business, including software engineers, developers, product management and development personnel, and other technology professionals. TripAdvisor\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. If TripAdvisor does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected.\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our subsidiaries or our financial performance.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, our business and our subsidiaries, including those relating to the Internet and online commerce, Internet advertising, consumer protection and privacy. Unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, increase costs and/or subject us and/or our subsidiaries to additional liabilities.\nFor example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. Our subsidiaries\u2019 current business partner arrangements with third parties, including Facebook, could be negatively impacted to the extent that more restrictive privacy laws or regulations are enacted, particularly in the United States or European Union. In addition, enforcement authorities in the United States continue to rely on their authority under existing consumer protection laws to take action against companies relating to data privacy and security practices. The growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.\nTripAdvisor also has been subject, and it will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations. The failure of its businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against TripAdvisor by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect its business,\nI-23\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, TripAdvisor\u2019s compliance with such laws may put it at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements.\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which TripAdvisor provides services could require it to change certain aspects of its business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results.\nDue to the global nature of its business, TripAdvisor is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. In the event TripAdvisor incurs net income in certain jurisdictions but incurs losses in other jurisdictions, it generally cannot offset the income from one jurisdiction with the loss from another, which could increase its effective tax rate. Furthermore, significant judgment is required to calculate TripAdvisor\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. By virtue of TripAdvisor\u2019s previously filed separate company and consolidated income tax returns with Expedia, TripAdvisor is routinely under audit by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Although TripAdvisor believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from its historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on TripAdvisor\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nAdditionally, TripAdvisor earns an increasing portion of its income, and accumulates a greater portion of cash flow, in foreign jurisdictions which it considers indefinitely reinvested. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s U.S. tax expense and cash flows.\nTripAdvisor cannot be sure that its intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.\nTripAdvisor\u2019s websites rely on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. TripAdvisor protects its proprietary content, brands and technology by relying on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and confidentiality agreements. In connection with its license agreements with third parties, TripAdvisor seeks to control access to, and the use and distribution of, proprietary technology, content and brands. Even with these precautions, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use TripAdvisor\u2019s proprietary technology, content or brands without authorization or to develop similar technology, content or brands independently. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which its services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of its intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, TripAdvisor may be unable to protect its intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect its business or ability to compete. TripAdvisor cannot be sure that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of its intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of TripAdvisor\u2019s rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, TripAdvisor may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. TripAdvisor\u2019s failure to protect its intellectual property in a cost-effective or effective manner could have a material adverse effect on its business and ability to protect its technology, content and brands.\nTripAdvisor currently licenses from third parties and incorporates the technologies and content into its websites. As TripAdvisor continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and content, it may be required to\nI-24\nlicense additional technology or content. TripAdvisor cannot be sure that such technology or content will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nTripAdvisor is subject to foreign exchange risk.\nTripAdvisor conducts a significant and growing portion of its business outside the United States. As a result, TripAdvisor faces exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the Euro, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Chinese renminbi. These exposures include, but are not limited to re-measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; and planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time TripAdvisor prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if TripAdvisor were to choose not to hedge or were to fail to hedge effectively its exposure, TripAdvisor could experience a material adverse effect on its financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates, the impact of these exposures can increase, and the impact on results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of TripAdvisor\u2019s business have made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly. TripAdvisor hedges certain short-term foreign currency exposures with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only help mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that its hedges will have their intended effects.\nSystem interruption and the lack of redundancy in some of its internal information systems may harm our subsidiaries\u2019 business.\nOur subsidiaries rely on computer systems to deliver content and services. Our subsidiaries have experienced, and may in the future experience, system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing content and services to users and third parties. Significant interruptions, outages or delays in internal systems, or systems of third parties that they rely upon or deterioration in the performance of any such systems, would impair our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to process transactions or display content and decrease the quality of the services they offer to users. These interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on their systems for fraud or service interruption (called \u201cdenial of service\u201d or \u201cbot\u201d attacks). If our subsidiaries were to experience frequent or persistent system failures, their business, reputations and brand could be harmed.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 backup systems and disaster recovery, business continuity or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of their operations or business processes may not be sufficient. Many other systems are not fully redundant and their disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. Although our subsidiaries have put measures in place to protect certain portions of their facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent them from providing content and services to users, travelers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be costly and our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 processing, storage and use of personal information and other data exposes them to risks stemming from external and internal security breaches and failure to comply with governmental regulation, which could give rise to liabilities.\nThere are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. Our subsidiaries strive to comply with all applicable\nI-25\nlaws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Any failure or perceived failure by our subsidiaries to comply with their privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements that could harm their reputation and cause their customers and members to lose trust in them, which could have an adverse effect on their businesses, brand, market share and results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet. U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. In addition, the European Union is finalizings reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies, including our subsidiaries, with users in Europe and increased costs of compliance.\nPotential security breaches to our subsidiaries\u2019 systems, whether resulting from internal or external sources, could significantly harm our business. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent their security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in their operations. In the past, our subsidiaries have experienced \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks on their systems that have made portions of their websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of their systems and data. In addition, TripAdvisor has acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future. While TripAdvisor makes significant efforts to address any information technology security issues with respect to its acquisitions, it may still inherit such risks when it integrates the acquired businesses. Our subsidiaries may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to investigate and address problems caused by breaches, and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, our subsidiaries may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions. Security breaches could also cause users and potential users to lose confidence in their security, which would have a negative effect on the value of their brands. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for their own systems or systems of vendors, could expose our subsidiaries to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance.\nOur subsidiaries also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. For example, much of TripAdvisor\u2019s business is conducted with third party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through its infrastructure or through its systems. In addition, our subsidiaries frequently use third parties to process credit card payments. A security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our subsidiaries\u2019 systems and could result in negative publicity, damage our subsidiaries\u2019 reputation, expose them to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject them to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements, which could expose our subsidiaries to liability.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt TripAdvisor\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\nTripAdvisor has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in its investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. We may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which it has limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with TripAdvisor\u2019s, and decisions of the company or venture in\nI-26\nwhich TripAdvisor invested may result in harm to its reputation or adversely affect the value of its investment. Further, TripAdvisor may issue shares of its common stock in these transactions, and as a result our company may experience significant dilution.\nIf the businesses TripAdvisor has acquired or invested in do not perform as expected or TripAdvisor is unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses, its operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nTripAdvisor has acquired a number of businesses in the past, and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, any of which could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on TripAdvisor\u2019s business are:\n\u00b7\nUse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions may limit other potential uses of its cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nAmortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;\n\u00b7\nExpected and unexpected costs incurred in identifying and pursuing acquisitions, and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;\n\u00b7\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from its existing business;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties and expenses in integrating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nCosts associated with litigation or other claims relating to the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and affiliates of its business and the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nThe assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nFailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated traffic, revenue, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;\n\u00b7\nFailure to generate adequate returns on acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7\nEntrance into markets in which TripAdvisor has no direct prior experience and increased complexity in its business;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions; and\n\u00b7\nAdverse market reaction to acquisitions.\nMoreover, TripAdvisor relies heavily on the representations and warranties provided to it by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. TripAdvisor\u2019s failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause it to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, to incur unanticipated liabilities and to harm its business generally.\nNo assurance can be made that we will be successful in integrating any acquired businesses.\nOur subsidiaries may grow through acquisitions in selected markets. Integration of new businesses may present significant challenges, including: realizing economies of scale in programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative overhead; and integrating networks, financial systems and operational systems. No assurance can be made that, with respect to any acquisition, we will realize anticipated benefits or successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing operations. In addition, while we intend to implement appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies\u2019 disclosure controls and\nI-27\nprocedures or internal control over financial reporting (as required by U.S. federal securities laws and regulations) until we have fully integrated them.\nFuture sales of shares of TripAdvisor\u2019s or our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress its or our stock price.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2014, the average daily trading volume of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq was approximately 2.2 million shares. If its stockholders were to sell substantial amounts of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock in the public market, the market price of its common stock and hence our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that TripAdvisor\u2019s existing stockholders or our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the trading price of our common stock. For example, sales of or hedging transactions, such as collars, in our shares by our Chairman of the Board or any of our other directors or executive officers could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price (and hence TripAdvisor\u2019s stock price) has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company or TripAdvisor. This perception could result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider transactions. In addition, we have the right to require TripAdvisor to file registration statements covering TripAdvisor shares we own or to include TripAdvisor shares in registration statements that it may file for itself or other stockholders. A decline in the price of shares of TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock or our common stock might impede its or our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities.\nThe seasonality of our subsidiary BuySeasons places increased strain on its operations.\nThe net revenue of BuySeasons in recent years indicates that its business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in certain months or calendar quarters or related to holiday shopping. BuySeasons earns approximately half of its revenue from the sale of costumes in September and October leading up to Halloween. If the vendors for BuySeasons\u2019 business are not able to provide popular products in sufficient amounts such that BuySeasons fails to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect its revenue and future growth. If too many customers access the websites of BuySeasons within a short period of time due to increased demand, its business may experience system interruptions that make its websites unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods it sells and the attractiveness of its products and services. In addition, BuySeasons may be unable to adequately staff its fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third party shipping (or carrier) companies may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.\nFactors Relating to the Trip Spin-Off\nWe may have a significant indemnity obligation to Liberty if the Trip Spin-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the Trip Spin-Off, Liberty received a ruling from the IRS (\u201cthe Ruling\u201d) and an opinion of tax counsel, in each case to the effect that the Trip Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code. Although the Ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the Ruling does not address certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to Liberty and the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock as a result of the IRS\u2019s ruling policy with respect to transactions under Section 355 of the Code (and instead is based upon representations made by Liberty that these requirements have been satisfied), and the continuing validity of the Ruling is subject to the accuracy of representations and factual statements made by Liberty to the IRS. Further, an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the conclusions expressed in such opinion could be challenged by the IRS, and a court could sustain such challenge. In October 2014, the IRS completed its examination of the Trip Spin-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. Liberty expects to execute a Closing Agreement with the IRS documenting this conclusion in 2015. If, however, it is determined, for whatever reason, that the Trip Spin-Off does not qualify for tax-free treatment, Liberty and/or the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock could incur significant tax liabilities.\nPrior to the Trip Spin-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty. Under this agreement, Liberty is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the Trip Spin-Off to qualify as a tax-free\nI-28\ntransaction; however, we are required to indemnify Liberty for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by our company and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Trip Spin-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Trip Spin-Off as a result of the treatment of the Trip Spin-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of our company or any successor corporation. Our indemnification obligations to Liberty are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Liberty for taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the Trip Spin-Off to qualify as tax-free, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Trip Spin-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Trip Spin-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligation related to the Trip Spin-Off under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Trip Spin-Off.\nWe may incur material costs as a result of our separation from Liberty.\nWe will incur costs and expenses not previously incurred as a result of our separation from Liberty. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), tax administration and human resources related functions. Although Liberty Media will continue to provide many of these services for us under the services agreement, we cannot assure you that the services agreement will continue or that these costs will not be material to our business.\nPrior to the Trip Spin-Off, we were not an independent company and we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company.\nPrior to the Trip Spin-Off, our business was operated by Liberty as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Liberty\u2019s senior management oversaw the strategic direction of our businesses and Liberty (directly and through its services agreement with Liberty Media) performed various corporate functions for us, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nselected human resources related functions;\n\u00b7\ntax administration;\n\u00b7\nselected legal functions (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), as well as external reporting;\n\u00b7\ntreasury administration, investor relations, internal audit and insurance functions; and\n\u00b7\nselected information technology and telecommunications services.\nFollowing the Trip Spin-Off, neither Liberty nor any of its affiliates have any obligation to provide these functions to us other than those services that will be provided by Liberty Media pursuant to the services agreement between us and Liberty Media. If, once our services agreement terminates, we do not have in place our own systems and business functions, we do not have agreements with other providers of these services or we are not able to make these changes cost effectively, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. If Liberty Media does not continue to perform effectively the services that are called for under its services agreement with us, we may not be able to operate our business effectively after the Trip Spin-Off.\nI-29\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty, Liberty Media and LBC, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Trip Spin-Off, the September 2011 separation of Starz from Liberty and Liberty Media\u2019s spin-off of LBC, most of our executive officers also serve as executive officers of Liberty, Liberty Media and LBC and there are overlapping directors. None of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty, Liberty Media or LBC have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty, Liberty Media or LBC looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, most of our company\u2019s directors and officers own Liberty, Liberty Media and LBC stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, Liberty, Liberty Media and/or LBC. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of our company and LBC have renounced their rights to certain business opportunities and each company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions deeming directors and officers not in breach of their fiduciary duties in certain cases for directing a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty, Liberty Media and LBC) instead of such company. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty, Liberty Media or LBC and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty, Liberty Media, LBC or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it provides to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we will pay Liberty Media a services fee. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media were at arms\u2019 length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Liberty, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Trip Spin-Off.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of TripAdvisor and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in TripAdvisor, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014, which, prior to the Trip Spin-Off, represented a large portion of the total market value of Liberty\u2019s Liberty Ventures tracking stock, as a whole, and, following the Trip Spin-Off, represents an even larger portion of our total market value. The Liberty Ventures tracking stock historically traded at times somewhat in tandem with TripAdvisor\u2019s common stock. As a result of the Trip Spin-Off, our stock price may move in tandem with the TripAdvisor stock price to a greater degree than the Liberty Ventures common stock did prior to the Trip Spin-Off, with the result that our stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of TripAdvisor and developments in its business.\nI-30\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures; our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent auditors are required to issue an opinion on management\u2019s assessment of those matters. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will first be tested in connection with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms beginning in 2015, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, Gregory B. Maffei, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director on our board, beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 27% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of February 28, 2015.\nI-31\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14873, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LTRPA"}
