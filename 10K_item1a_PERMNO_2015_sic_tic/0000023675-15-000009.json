{"cik": "23675", "company": "Con-way Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCon-way's consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks before making any investment or other decisions.\nEconomic Cyclicality\nCon-way's operating results are affected, in large part, by cyclical conditions in its customers' markets and in the U.S. and global economies. While economic conditions affect most companies, the transportation industry is cyclical and susceptible to trends in economic activity. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, Con-way's businesses transport fewer goods. In addition, Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload are capital-intensive and Con-way Freight has a relatively high fixed-cost structure that is difficult to adjust to match shifting volume levels. Accordingly, any sustained weakness in demand or continued downturn or uncertainty in the economy generally would have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nIndustry Competition\nThe transportation market is highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. Some of the Company's competitors have more financial resources than Con-way, more equipment, a broader global network, a wider range of services or have other competitive advantages. Some competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit Con-way's ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain revenue. Consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.\nCustomer behavior may also change in response to market pressures in a way that adversely affects Con-way's business units. Many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting \"core carriers\" as approved transportation service providers and Con-way may not be among those selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Some customers may choose to consolidate certain shipments through a different mode of transportation. In addition, high volume package shippers could develop in-house ground delivery capabilities, which would in turn reduce Con-way's revenue and market share. If Con-way is unable to compete effectively through its current service offerings, if current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or more effectively bundle their services or if Con-way's current customers become competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on Con-way's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment Regulation and Taxes\nCon-way operates in a highly regulated and highly taxed industry. As discussed more fully in Item 1, \"Business,\" Con-way is subject to the regulatory powers of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security, among other federal agencies, as well as various state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to its business activities. These include regulations related to, among other things, driver hours-of-service limitations, labor organizing activities, cargo security requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, tax, data privacy and data security laws, employment practices, healthcare and environmental matters, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation. Con-way may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations imposed by such agencies in respect of engine exhaust emissions, driver hours of service, security, ergonomics, and a number of other unforeseen issues potentially applicable to its businesses or the industry.\nConcern over climate change, for example, has led to increased legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Even without such regulation, Con-way's response to customer-led sustainability initiatives could lead to increased costs to implement additional efforts to reduce its emissions. Additionally, Con-way may experience reduced demand for its services if it does not comply with customers' sustainability requirements. As a result, increased costs or loss of revenue resulting from sustainability initiatives could have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nThe costs of compliance with existing or future laws or regulations, as well as any potential liabilities under or violations of such laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on Con-way. As these regulatory requirements continue to evolve, Con-way is not able to accurately predict how new governmental laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, will affect the transportation industry generally, or Con-way in particular. As a result, Con-way believes that any additional\nmeasures that may be required by future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could result in additional costs and could have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nVarious federal, state and local authorities impose operating taxes, including fuel taxes, tolls, and excise and other taxes, on the transportation industry. In addition, various license and registration fees and bonding requirements apply to Con-way's business activities. Increases in these operating taxes, fees and requirements, or new forms of such operating taxes, fees and requirements, could result in additional costs and could have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nCapital Markets\nSignificant disruptions or volatility in the global capital markets may increase Con-way's cost of borrowing or affect its ability to access credit, debt and equity capital markets. Market conditions may affect Con-way's ability to refinance indebtedness as and when it becomes due. In addition, changes in Con-way's credit ratings could adversely affect its ability and cost to borrow funds. Con-way is unable to predict how conditions in the capital markets will affect its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPrice and Availability of Fuel\nCon-way is subject to risks associated with the availability and price of fuel, which are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of Con-way's control.\nCon-way would be adversely affected by an inability to obtain fuel in the future. Although, historically, Con-way has been able to obtain fuel from various sources and in the desired quantities, there can be no assurance that this would continue to be the case in the future.\nCon-way may also be adversely affected by the timing and degree of fluctuations and volatility in fuel prices. Currently, Con-way's business units have fuel-surcharge revenue programs or cost-recovery mechanisms in place with a majority of customers. Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload maintain fuel-surcharge programs designed to offset or mitigate the adverse effect of rising fuel prices. Menlo has cost-recovery mechanisms incorporated into most of its customer contracts under which it recognizes fuel-surcharge revenue designed to mitigate the adverse effect of rising fuel prices on the costs for purchased transportation.\nCon-way's competitors in the LTL and truckload markets also impose fuel surcharges. Although fuel surcharges are generally based on a published national index, there is no industry-wide standard fuel-surcharge formula. As a result, fuel-surcharge revenue constitutes only part of the overall rate structure. Revenue excluding fuel surcharges (usually referred to as base freight rates) represents the collective pricing elements other than fuel surcharges. Ultimately, the total amount that Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload can charge for their services is determined by competitive pricing pressures and market factors.\nHistorically, Con-way Freight's fuel-surcharge program has enabled it to more than offset changes in fuel costs and fuel-related volatility in purchased transportation costs. However, market conditions for fuel can impact Con-way Freight's ability to fully absorb and recover such changes under its fuel-surcharge program over time. Con-way Freight also modifies its fuel-surcharge program from time to time in response to market conditions and industry dynamics. Such modifications can impact the extent of fuel-surcharge revenue collected or the volatility of fuel surcharges imposed under the program. As a result, Con-way Freight may be adversely affected to the extent fuel price changes or pricing volatility impacts Con-way Freight's ability to offset such changes with fuel surcharges under its then-current program or base freight rates.\nCon-way Truckload's fuel-surcharge program mitigates the effect of rising fuel prices but does not always result in Con-way Truckload fully recovering increases in its cost of fuel. The extent of recovery may vary depending on the amount of customer-negotiated adjustments and the degree to which Con-way Truckload is not compensated due to empty and out-of-route miles or from engine idling during cold or warm weather.\nCon-way would be adversely affected if, due to competitive and market factors, its business units are unable to continue with their fuel-surcharge programs and/or cost-recovery mechanisms. In addition, there can be no assurance that these programs, as currently maintained or as modified in the future, will be sufficiently effective to offset changes in the price of fuel in the future.\nDriver Availability and Driver Compensation\nCon-way hires drivers primarily for Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload. Recently, there has been intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a nationwide shortage of drivers. The availability of qualified drivers may be affected from time to time by changing workforce demographics, competition from other transportation companies and industries for employees, the availability and affordability of driver training schools, changing industry regulations, and the demand for drivers in the labor market. If the industry-wide shortage of qualified drivers continues, Con-way will likely continue to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining enough qualified drivers to fully satisfy customer demands.\nAs a result of the current highly-competitive labor market for drivers, in 2014 and early 2015, Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload implemented increases in compensation and benefits for their drivers and may be required to further increase driver compensation and benefits, or face difficulty meeting customer demands, all of which could adversely affect Con-way's profitability. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in underutilization of Con-way's truck fleet, lost revenue, increased costs for purchased transportation or increased costs for driver recruitment.\nCyber Threats and Business Interruption\nCon-way and its business units rely on shared-service facilities that provide shared administrative and technology services. A sustained interruption in Con-way's systems or operations due to a catastrophic event, such as terrorist activity, earthquake, weather event, or cyber attack, could have a material adverse effect on Con-way's operations and financial results.\nCon-way is dependent on its operational and information technology systems to operate its businesses and to provide critical services to its employees and customers. Con-way has outsourced a significant portion of its information technology infrastructure and a portion of its operational, administrative and accounting functions to third-party service providers. Although Con-way and its third-party service providers collectively maintain backup systems and have disaster-recovery processes and procedures, Con-way's operational and information technology systems are susceptible to sustained interruption due to events such as failures during transition to upgraded or replacement technology, power outages, computer viruses, code anomalies, telecommunications failures, user errors, third-party contractual failures and other reasons. They are also susceptible to cyber threats and attacks, such as malware, attacks by computer hackers, denial of service attacks by groups of hackers and other threats. Certain of the outsourced services are also performed in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical and other uncertainty or risk. A sustained interruption to critical networks or to Con-way's operational and information technology systems, including those affecting the Company's computer systems and customer websites, could adversely impact its operations, customer service, reputation, volumes and revenue and could have a material adverse effect on Con-way's operations and financial results. Further, although Con-way and its third-party providers have preventive systems and processes in place to protect against the risk of cyber attacks, data losses and security breaches, these measures cannot fully insulate Con-way from technology disruptions that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Company and customer information, which in turn could adversely affect Con-way's operations, customer service and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on Con-way's operations and financial results.\nLabor Organization\nCon-way believes that maintaining a union-free environment within its business units provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace and allows the Company to most effectively and directly serve the needs of its employees. Without the possible constraints of a union, each Con-way business unit is able to operate with efficiency and flexibility, providing customers with reliable, innovative and cost-competitive services.\nIn 2014, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, or the Teamsters, made organizing attempts at a small number of Con-way Freight locations. The outcomes of those efforts have generally been favorable for the Company, although a very small percentage of Con-way Freight employees have selected Teamsters representation. As of December 31, 2014, the Teamsters union has been certified as the bargaining representative for employees at only one of Con-way Freight's nearly 300 locations. Further unionizing efforts by the Teamsters are likely to continue in 2015, and the Company cannot predict with certainty whether that activity will result in the unionization of any additional Con-way Freight locations. A further unionized workforce could potentially result in reduced operational flexibility and impair Con-way's ability to quickly respond to market conditions with innovative solutions for customers.\nCapital Intensity\nCon-way Freight and Con-way Truckload make significant investments in revenue equipment, and Con-way Freight also makes significant investments in freight service centers. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including anticipated volume levels and the price and availability of appropriate-use property for service centers and newly manufactured tractors, which are subject to restrictive Environmental Protection Agency engine-design requirements. If anticipated service center and/or fleet requirements differ materially from actual usage, Con-way's capital-intensive business units may have too much or too little capacity. Con-way attempts to mitigate the risk associated with too much or too little revenue equipment capacity by adjusting capital expenditures and by utilizing short-term equipment rentals and sub-contracted operators in order to match capacity with business volumes. Con-way's investments in revenue equipment and freight service centers depend on its ability to generate cash flow from operations and its access to credit, debt and equity capital markets. A decline in the availability of these funding sources could adversely affect Con-way.\nWith respect to Menlo, implementing warehouse-management services for customers can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems. In the event that Menlo is not able to fully amortize the cost of that capital across the term of the related customer agreement, or to the extent that the customer defaults on its obligations under the agreement, Menlo could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of the capital cost.\nAsset Impairments\nCon-way's assets include significant amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Con-way's regular reviews of the carrying value of its assets have resulted, from time to time, in significant impairment charges. It is possible that Con-way may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect Con-way's results of operations.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCon-way maintains defined benefit plans, including funded qualified pension plans, unfunded non-qualified pension plans, and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. A decline in interest rates and/or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for Con-way's defined benefit pension plans. Despite past amendments that permanently curtailed benefits under its defined benefit pension plans, Con-way's defined benefit pension plans remain subject to volatility associated with interest rates, returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and funding requirements. In addition to being subject to volatility associated with interest rates, Con-way's expense and obligation under its postretirement medical plan are also subject to actuarial assumptions and trends in health-care costs. As a result, Con-way is unable to predict the effect on the Company's financial statements associated with the defined benefit pension plans and the postretirement medical plan.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals\nCon-way uses a combination of self-insurance programs and large-deductible purchased insurance to provide for the costs of employee medical, vehicular, cargo and workers' compensation claims. Con-way's estimated liability for self-retained insurance claims reflects certain actuarial assumptions and judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. Con-way periodically evaluates the level of insurance coverage and adjusts insurance levels based on targeted risk tolerance and premium expense. An increase in the number and/or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nCon-way has a captive insurance company that participates in a reinsurance pool to reinsure a portion of Con-way's workers' compensation claims. Each company that participates in the pool cedes premiums and claims to the pool and assumes premiums and claims from the pool. The operating results of the captive insurance company are affected by the number and/or severity of claims and the associated premiums paid or received. Con-way's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the risk assumed and ceded by the captive insurance company. In addition, Con-way's captive insurance companies are subject to financial and insurance regulation by a foreign regulatory authority and changes in these applicable regulations could affect Con-way's liquidity and asset allocation with its captive insurance companies.\nCon-way expects costs associated with providing benefits under postretirement medical plans and employee medical plans to increase due to health care reform legislation. Changes made to the design of Con-way's medical plans have the potential to mitigate some of the cost impact of the provisions included in the legislation. Ultimately, the cost of providing benefits under medical plans is dependent on a variety of factors, including governmental laws and regulations, health care cost trends, claims experience and health care decisions by plan participants. As a result, Con-way is unable to predict how the cost of providing benefits under medical plans will affect its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCustomer Concentration and Contract Terms\nMenlo is subject to risk related to customer concentration because of the relative importance of its largest customers and the ability of those customers to negotiate aggressive pricing and other customer-favorable contract terms. Many of its competitors in the logistics industry segment are subject to the same risk. Although Menlo strives to broaden and diversify its customer base, a significant portion of its revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large and sophisticated customers, as more fully discussed in Item 1, \"Business.\" Consequently, a significant loss of business from, or adverse performance by, Menlo's major customers may have a material adverse effect on Con-way's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, the renegotiation of major customer contracts may also have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nMenlo is also subject to credit risk associated with its customer concentration. If one or more of its largest customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for services provided, Menlo may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable or incur lease or asset-impairment charges that may have a material adverse effect on Con-way's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Menlo always seeks to reduce risks related to the termination of a customer relationship, for reasons other than the business failure of a customer, by requiring, upon the termination of the contract, that\nthe customer assume any related lease obligations and/or purchase contract-specific assets purchased by Menlo. Its ability to successfully negotiate for those contract terms with any particular customer is, however, dependent upon many factors.\nAdditionally, Menlo is subject to risk if contract terms and conditions do not adequately cover Menlo's exposure to increased or unexpected expenses. Changes in customers' business needs or operations may result in Menlo incurring expenses it may not be able to completely recover or offset through contractual pricing terms or contract renegotiations. Also, contract terms and conditions may not sufficiently limit Menlo's exposure to claims from customers or third parties. As a result, increased expenses resulting from these exposures could have an adverse effect on Con-way.\nOther Factors\nIn addition to the risks identified above, Con-way's annual and quarterly operating results may be affected by a number of business, economic, regulatory and competitive factors, including:\n\u2022\nloss of senior management or other key employees who implement Con-way's business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of Con-way's customers and their ability to pay for services rendered;\n\u2022\nany liability resulting from and the costs of defending against litigation and claims related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters;\n\u2022\nthe effect of severe winter weather or other weather or disaster-related events; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of defaults under Con-way's $325 million credit agreement and other debt instruments.", "PERMNO": 41929, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "CNW"}
