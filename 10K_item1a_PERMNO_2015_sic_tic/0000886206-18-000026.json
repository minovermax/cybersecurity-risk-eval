{"cik": "886206", "company": "FRANKLIN COVEY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business environment, current domestic and international economic conditions, geopolitical circumstances, and other specific risks may affect our future business decisions and financial performance. The matters discussed below may cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward-looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and stock price, and should be considered in evaluating our Company.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional risk factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing global environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and our competitors may develop programs, services, or courses that adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings.\nThe training and consulting services industry is intensely competitive with relatively easy entry. Competitors continually introduce new programs and services that may compete directly with our offerings, or that may make our offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Larger competitors may have superior abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals, reducing our ability to deliver quality work to our clients. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, one or more of our competitors may develop and implement training courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings and products to new clients. Any one of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business and successfully deliver our services.\nThe introduction of the All Access Pass has been disruptive to our business and may continue to create both operational and financial challenges during the transition to a subscription services-focused business model.\nIn fiscal 2016, we introduced the All Access Pass, which is an internet-based platform that allows our clients to purchase unlimited access to our intellectual property for a specified period. Clients may utilize entire training offerings or use individual portions of numerous programs to customize a training or personnel program that fits their needs. As expected, the change to a subscription services-focused business model has been disruptive as we transition our legacy business to this new delivery model, but we believe the benefits of the AAP and Leader in Me online service to our clients and to our business will ultimately prove beneficial as we continue to emphasize and grow sales of subscription services.\nThe change to a subscription-focused business model has required a transition both operationally, as our sales force adapts its structure and strategy to sell these services, and from an accounting and reporting point of view. Operationally, we have reorganized our Direct Office sales force to focus on and support AAP sales and renewals. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we decided to allow new AAP intellectual property agreements to receive updated content throughout the contract period. Applicable accounting standards required us to defer substantially all AAP revenues at the inception of the contracts and then recognize the revenue over the life of the corresponding arrangement. This determination had a significant impact on both our fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 financial results.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt our sales force and sales strategy to sell subscription services, or if technological development of these services becomes too costly or is not accepted by the market, the transition period to a subscription-focused business model may be lengthened and our ability to achieve previous levels of profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe All Access Pass and Leader in Me online service are internet-based platforms, and as such we are subject to increased risks of cyber-attacks and other security breaches that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of selling the AAP and Leader in Me online service, we collect, process, and retain a limited amount of sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. Because these services are internet-based platforms, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, stolen intellectual property, programming or human errors, or other similar events.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, our brand and reputation could be affected, and these conditions could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional cash investments in order to grow and meet the demands of our clients.\nSince the introduction of the AAP and Leader in Me online service, our dependence on the use of sophisticated technologies and systems has increased. Moreover, our technology platforms will require continuing cash investments by us to expand existing offerings, improve the client experience, and develop complementary offerings. Our future success depends in part on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace. Failure to adapt and improve these areas could have an adverse effect on our business, including our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe could incur additional liabilities or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or if our information systems are breached.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of individually identifiable information. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise\nmismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, the European Union and the U.S. formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from European Union member states to the U.S. This new framework, called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in a predecessor mechanism. The Privacy Shield and other data protection mechanisms face a number of legal challenges by both private parties and regulators, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic. Ongoing legal reviews may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nIn addition, in May 2018 the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in the European Union. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on the collection, use, security, and transfer of personal information in and from European Union member states. The GDPR is designed to unify data protection within the European Union under a single law, which may result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs related to our European Union operations and customers. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to four percent of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed. Although GDPR applies across the European Union, local data protection authorities still have the ability to interpret GDPR, which may create inconsistencies in application on a country-by-country basis. Furthermore, as the United Kingdom transitions out of the European Union, we may encounter additional complexity with respect to data privacy and data transfers from the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2018, we implemented new controls and procedures, including a team dedicated to data protection, to comply with the Privacy Shield and the requirements of GDPR, which were effective for us in May 2018. However, these new procedures and controls may not be completely effective in preventing unauthorized breaches of personal data.\nOther governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. However, legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and their levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions affect our clients' businesses and the markets in which they operate. Our financial results are somewhat dependent on the amount that current and prospective clients budget for training. A serious and/or prolonged economic downturn combined with a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients' financial condition and the amount budgeted for training by our clients. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services or depress the pricing of those services and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in global economic\nconditions may also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Such economic, political, and client spending conditions are influenced by a wide range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. If we are unable to successfully anticipate these changing conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business success also depends in part upon continued growth in the use of training and consulting services and the renewal of existing contracts by our clients. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new services and consulting solutions in order to focus on other priorities. At the same time, many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting their business and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel and/or processes. If growth in the general use of training and consulting services in business or our clients' spending on these items declines, or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new services and solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and, consequently, the benefits of an economic recovery following a period of economic downturn may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.\nOur financial success is partially dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary offerings and other intellectual property. The existing laws of some countries in which we provide services might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. To protect our intellectual property, we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright and trademark laws. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, especially in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe loss of proprietary content or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may create greater competition, loss of revenue, adverse publicity, and may limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future engagements.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individuals could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain additional qualified senior personnel. Competition for such individuals in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees, including training consultants and other key training representatives, we may not be able to grow our business as projected or may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success and ability to grow are partially dependent on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve our clients and grow our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority. There is a risk that we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require, or that it will prove difficult to retain them in a competitive labor market. If we are unable to hire and retain talented sales and delivery employees with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might not be able to grow our business at projected levels or may not be able to effectively deliver our content and services. If we need to hire additional personnel to maintain a specified number of sales personnel or are required to re-assign personnel from other geographic areas, it could increase our costs and adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, the inability of newly hired sales personnel to achieve projected sales levels may inhibit our ability to attain anticipated growth.\nOur global operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax, and economic risks, which we may not adequately address.\nWe have sales offices in Australia, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We also have licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries. As a result of these foreign operations and their impact upon our financial statements, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the movement of cash\n\u00b7\nBurdens of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws, including tax laws\n\u00b7\nThe absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights\n\u00b7\nPolitical instability\n\u00b7\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u00b7\nLonger payment cycles\n\u00b7\nPrice controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies\nFor instance, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters chose to exit the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" The outcome of this referendum produced significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets and it is expected that the British government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of Brexit. Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit or how such implications might affect us are unclear. Brexit could, among other things, disrupt trade and the free movement of data, goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. These and other potential implications of Brexit could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRecent developments in international trade may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results, and financial condition.\nThe United States recently proposed and enacted certain tariffs. In addition, there have been ongoing discussions and activities regarding changes to other U.S. trade policies and treaties. In response, some countries in which we operate, including China, are threatening to implement or have already implemented tariffs on U.S. imports or otherwise imposed non-tariff barriers. These developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and they may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between China and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, create anti-American consumer sentiment, restrict our access to suppliers or customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any actions by non-U.S. markets to implement further trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory scrutiny or taking other actions which impact U.S. companies' ability to obtain necessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nOur sales outside of the United States totaled $58.7 million, or approximately 28 percent of consolidated sales, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. If our international operations continue to grow and become a larger component of our overall financial results, the impacts of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may become magnified and our revenues\nand operating results may be adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies. In order to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk, we may from time-to-time make limited use of foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge certain transactions and translation exposure. However, there can be no guarantee that our foreign currency risk management strategy will be effective in reducing the risks associated with foreign currency transactions and translation.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.\nBecause we provide services to clients in many countries, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, regulations on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, and labor relations. Violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages, fines, unfavorable publicity, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may be insufficient to protect our rights.\nIn many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits giving anything of value intended to influence the awarding of government contracts. Although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, licensee operators, and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines and suspension or disqualification from United States federal procurement contracting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These periodic reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts' estimates of our future performance. The analysts' estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities litigation following a decline in price. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nOur business performance may not be sufficient for us to meet the full-year financial guidance that we provide publicly.\nWe provide full-year financial guidance to the public based upon our expectations regarding our financial performance. While we believe that our annual financial guidance provides investors and analysts with insight into our view of the Company's future performance, such financial guidance is based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results. If we fail to meet the full-year financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our stock price has experienced significant volatility. We expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows\n\u00b7\nIncreased overall market volatility\n\u00b7\nVariations between our actual financial results and market expectations\n\u00b7\nChanges in our key balances, such as cash and cash equivalents\n\u00b7\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u00b7\nUnexpected asset impairment charges\n\u00b7\nIncreased or decreased analyst coverage\nThese factors may have an adverse effect upon our stock price in the future.\nThe sale of a large number of common shares by Knowledge Capital could depress the market price of our common stock.\nKnowledge Capital Investment Group (Knowledge Capital), a related party primarily controlled by a member of our Board of Directors, holds 2.8 million shares, or approximately 20 percent, of our outstanding common shares. On January 26, 2015, the SEC declared effective a registration statement on Form S-3 to register shares held by Knowledge Capital. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of the shares held by Knowledge Capital may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates.\nThe profit margin on our services is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization, or chargeability, of our trainers, client partners, and consultants. Accordingly, if we are unable to maintain sufficient pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our training professionals without corresponding cost reductions, our profit margin and overall profitability will suffer. The rates that we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors that we may be unable to control, including:\n\u00b7\nOur clients' perceptions of our ability to add value through our programs and content\n\u00b7\nCompetition\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions\n\u00b7\nIntroduction of new programs or services by us or our competitors\n\u00b7\nOur ability to accurately estimate, attain, and sustain engagement sales, margins, and cash flows over longer contract periods\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable pricing or utilization rates in future periods. Additionally, we may not achieve pricing or utilization rates that are optimal for us. If our utilization rates are too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition. If our pricing or utilization rates are too low, our profit margin and profitability may suffer.\nOur work with governmental clients exposes us to additional risks that are inherent in the government contracting process.\nOur clients include national, state, provincial, and local governmental entities, and our work with these governmental entities has various risks inherent in the governmental contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nGovernmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the governmental entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of, or terminate, these projects for lack of approved funding and other discretionary reasons. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could result in changes in the scope of, or in termination of, our existing contracts.\n\u00b7\nGovernmental entities often reserve the right to audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts. If the governmental entity finds that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for those costs or the cost must be refunded to the client if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed upon rates for our work, which may affect our future margins.\n\u00b7\nIf a governmental client discovers improper activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of their adequacy.\n\u00b7\nPolitical and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of elections, revisions to governmental tax policies, sequestration, debt ceiling negotiations, and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new governmental contracts signed.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular governmental agency involved, but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities. Additionally, because of their visibility and political nature, governmental contracts may present a heightened risk to our reputation. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. at the state and federal level, and in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. state, federal, or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could materially affect our tax expense and profitability.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Reform), a tax reform bill which contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction in the current corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, substantial changes to the taxation of foreign earnings, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. The changes included in the 2017 Tax Reform are broad and complex. The final transition impact of the 2017 Tax Reform may differ from the amounts we have recorded due to, among other things, additional regulatory and interpretive guidance, as well as any statutory technical corrections that are subsequently enacted.\nThe 2017 Tax Reform, or any related, similar, or amended legislation or other changes in the U.S. federal income tax laws, could adversely affect the U.S. federal taxation of our ongoing operations. Any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nIf we are unable to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain timely payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for services performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. However, as our sales to governmental entities, including school districts, continue to grow, our collection cycle may take longer due to procurement and payment procedures at these clients. We maintain allowances against our receivables that we believe are adequate to reserve for potentially uncollectible amounts. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we may need to adjust our allowances. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or not pay their obligations to us. Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our invoiced revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if FC Organizational Products LLC is unable to pay the working capital settlement, reimbursable acquisition costs, or reimbursable operating expenses.\nIn fiscal 2008, we sold our planning products operation to FC Organizational Products, LLC (FCOP), an entity in which we own a 19.5 percent interest. According to the agreements associated with the sale, we were entitled to receive a $1.2 million payment for working capital delivered on the closing date of the sale and to receive $2.3 million as reimbursement for specified costs necessary to complete the transaction. Payment for these costs was originally due in January 2009, but we extended the due date of the payment at FCOP's request and obtained a promissory note from FCOP for the amount owed, plus accrued interest. At the time we received the promissory note from FCOP, we believed that we could obtain payment for the amounts owed, based on prior year performance and forecasted financial performance in 2009. However, due to FCOP's deteriorating financial results, we reassessed the collectability of the promissory note and recorded a $3.6 million impaired asset charge against these receivables.\nWe also receive reimbursement from FCOP for certain operating costs, such as rent. At August 31, 2018, we had $1.5 million of receivables from FCOP, net of related discount, which are recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Although we believe that we will obtain payment from FCOP for these receivables, the valuation of amounts receivable from FCOP is dependent upon the estimated future earnings and cash flows of FCOP. If FCOP's estimated future earnings and cash flows decline, or if FCOP fails to pay amounts receivable and we fail to obtain payment on the previously impaired promissory note, our future cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact our financial results.\nOur most critical accounting estimates are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis found in Item 7 of this report under the section entitled \"Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies.\" In addition, as discussed in various footnotes to our financial statements as found in Item 8, we make certain estimates for loss contingencies, including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because, by definition, these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, our actual financial results may differ from these estimates.\nFailure to comply with the terms and conditions of our credit facility may have an adverse effect upon our business and operations.\nOur secured credit agreement and subsequent modifications require us to be in compliance with customary non-financial terms and conditions as well as specified financial ratios. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions or maintain adequate financial performance to comply with specific financial ratios entitles the lender to certain remedies, including the right to immediately call due any amounts outstanding on the line of credit. Such events would have an adverse effect upon our business and operations as there can be no assurance that we may be able to obtain other forms of financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to:\n\u00b7\nDevelop new services, programs, or offerings\n\u00b7\nTake advantage of opportunities, including business acquisitions\n\u00b7\nRespond to competitive pressures\nGoing forward, we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day-to-day operation and potential growth of the business and may use our available revolving line of credit facility and other financing alternatives, if necessary, for these expenditures. Our existing credit arrangement expires on March 31, 2021 and we expect to regularly renew our lending agreement to maintain the availability of this credit facility. Additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include factoring receivables, issuance of additional equity, or issuance of debt from public or private sources. If necessary, we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute current shareholders' ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe have significant intangible assets, goodwill, and long-term asset balances that may be impaired if cash flows from related activities decline.\nAt August 31, 2018 we had $51.9 million of intangible assets and $24.2 million of goodwill. Our intangible assets are evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors or upon cash flows and estimated royalties from revenue streams (indefinite-lived intangible assets) if necessary. Our goodwill is evaluated through qualitative factors and by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of our net assets if necessary. Although our current sales, cash flows, and market capitalization are sufficient to support the carrying basis of these long-lived assets, if our sales, cash flows, or common stock price decline, we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges that would have an adverse impact upon our results of operations.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results may be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.", "PERMNO": 77637, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "FC"}
