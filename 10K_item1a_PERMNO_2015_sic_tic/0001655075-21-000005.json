{"cik": "1655075", "company": "Armstrong Flooring, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business, Operations and Industry\nFailure to successfully execute our strategy to transform and modernize our business and related investment costs may materially adversely affect our market position, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIn March 2020 we announced our strategy to transform and modernize our business, including through go-to-market efforts featuring expanded customer reach, simplification of our business processes, strengthened product innovation and optimized production capabilities. Our inability to execute and fund any of these strategies, including through any failure to invest sufficiently, or to realize intended revenue; margin; selling, general and administrative expenses; working capital or capital expenditure benefits or improvements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe compete with numerous flooring manufacturers in highly competitive markets. Competition can affect customer preferences, reduce demand for our products, negatively affect our product sales mix, leverage greater financial resources, or cause us to lower prices, any or all which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur markets are highly competitive. We compete for sales of flooring products with many manufacturers and independent distributors of resilient flooring as well as with manufacturers who also produce other types of flooring products. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Competition can reduce demand for our products, negatively affect our product sales mix or cause us to lower prices. Our customers consider our products' performance, content and styling, as well as customer service and price when deciding whether to purchase our products. Shifting consumer preference in our highly competitive markets whether for performance, product content, styling preferences, or our inability to develop and offer new competitive performance features, could have an adverse effect on our sales. Regulatory action or new product standards could also steer consumers away from our products.\nIn addition, excess industry capacity for certain products in several geographic markets could lead to industry consolidation and/or increased price competition. We are also subject to potential increased price competition from overseas competitors, which may have lower cost structures.\nOur failure to compete effectively through management of our product portfolio, by meeting consumer preferences, maintaining market share positions in our traditional categories and gaining market leadership in growth product categories such as LVT, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIf the availability of direct materials (raw materials, packaging, sourced products, energy) decreases, or these costs increase and we are unable to pass along increased costs, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe availability and cost of direct materials, including raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products are critical to our operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of petrochemical-based raw materials in our manufacturing operations. The cost of some of these items has been volatile in recent years and availability has been limited at times. We source some materials from a limited number of suppliers, which, among other things, increases the risk of unavailability. We also source from overseas and could be subject to international trade costs, such as tariffs, transportation and foreign exchange rates, or international epidemics, including, without limitation, the COVID-19 outbreak. There is also a concentration of our sourced products in an emerging market, which subjects us to legislative, political, regulatory and economic volatility and vulnerability. This dependency and any limited availability could cause us to reformulate products or limit our production. Decreased access to direct materials and energy or significant increased cost to purchase these items, as well as increased transportation and trade costs, delays due to government-mandated initiatives in response to the COVID-19 and any corresponding inability to pass along such costs through price increases or meet demand requirements, as applicable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSales fluctuations to and changes in our relationships with key customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSome of our business lines and markets are dependent on a few key customers, including independent distributors. The loss, reduction, or fluctuation of sales to one of these major customers, or any adverse change in our business relationship with any one of them, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on construction activity. Downturns in construction activity could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business has greater sales opportunities when construction activity is strong and, conversely, has fewer opportunities when such activity declines. The cyclical nature of commercial and residential construction activity, including construction activity funded by the public sector, tends to be influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including the rate of growth in GDP, prevailing interest rates, government spending patterns, business, investor and consumer confidence and other factors beyond our control. Prolonged downturns in construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nWe require a significant amount of liquidity to fund our strategy and operations.\nOur liquidity needs vary throughout the year. If our business experiences materially negative unforeseen events, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our needs or maintain sufficient liquidity to operate and remain in compliance with our debt covenants, which could result in reduced or delayed planned capital expenditures and other investments and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur credit agreements contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe credit agreements underlying our $90 million Amended ABL Credit Facility and $70 million Term Loan Facility include covenants that, among other things, may impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions or limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests. The credit facilities include covenants that, among other things, require us to provide the bank groups' agents (the \u201cAgents\u201d) with certain information with respect to us and the borrowing base and to maintain or otherwise preserve the collateral in favor of the Agents and further restricts our ability to make acquisitions and repurchase equity. Under the terms of the credit facilities, we are required to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage and net leverage ratios. Our ability to meet these ratios could be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will meet them. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants or ratios would result in a default under the credit facilities. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the credit facilities may be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under our facilities, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest. The lenders may also have the right in these circumstances to terminate commitments to provide further borrowings.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, make payments on our indebtedness and declare dividends on our capital stock.\nOur level of indebtedness and degree of leverage could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, more able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from pursuing;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022restrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock; and\n\u2022adversely affect our credit ratings.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness, which could exacerbate the risks described above. In addition, to the extent that our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates, our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations will increase.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Macro-Economic and Regulatory Environment\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of COVID-19.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new strain of COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation due to \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d restrictions by various governments worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This adversely impacted our results of operations during fiscal year 2020. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related restrictions on travel and transports; the effect on our customers and demand for our products and services; our ability to sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working remotely; the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services; the overall health of our production employees and our ability to maintain adequate staffing of our facilities to satisfy marketplace demand for our products; and any closures of our or our customers\u2019 offices and facilities all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, our results of operations, our access to sources of liquidity, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets, our financial condition and our stock price.\nWorldwide economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business is influenced by conditions in domestic and foreign economies, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability and cost of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and the continued softness or further deterioration of national and global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, including as follows:\n\u2022the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022commercial and residential consumers of our products may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or stagnation or further declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our product;\n\u2022the fair value of the investment funds underlying our defined-benefit pension plans may decline, which could result in negative plan investment performance, additional charges and may require significant cash contributions to such plans to meet obligations or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022our asset impairment assessments and underlying valuation assumptions may change, which could result from changes to estimates of future sales and cash flows that may lead to substantial impairment charges.\nContinued or sustained deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate and prolong these adverse effects.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations in both established and emerging markets. Legislative, political, regulatory and economic volatility, as well as vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nA portion of our products move in international trade, with approximately 20% of our revenues from operations outside the U.S. and Canada in 2020. Our international trade is subject to currency exchange fluctuations, trade regulations, tariffs, import duties, logistics costs, delays and other related risks, including, for example, the COVID-19 outbreak. Our international operations are also subject to various tax rates, credit risks in emerging markets, political risks, uncertain legal systems and loss of sales to local competitors following currency devaluations in countries where we import products for sale.\nIn addition, our international growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in certain emerging markets. However, some emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. In many countries outside of the U.S., particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. As we continue to expand our business globally, including in emerging markets, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our international operations may face, which may adversely affect our business outside the U.S. and our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liability under and may make substantial future expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities for which our ultimate liability may exceed the currently estimated and accrued amounts. It is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental matters and corresponding liabilities in the future. See Note 19, Litigation and Related Matters, in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements,\" for further information related to environmental matters.\nOur industry has been subject to claims relating to raw materials. We have not received any significant claims involving our raw materials or our product performance; however, product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances to cover claims that may arise in the future.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOther Risks Related to our Operations\nDisruptions to or failures of our various information systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on our information systems to operate our business activities, including, among other things, purchasing, distribution, inventory management, processing, shipping and receiving, billing and collection, financial reporting and record keeping. We also rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales systems, distribution systems and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any interruption, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, system conversion, intentional acts of vandalism, or various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions, malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, harm to our reputation and loss or misappropriation of sensitive information, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur performance depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented management.\nWe must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in senior management, sales, marketing, product design and operations. We compete with numerous companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position, execution on strategic priorities and operating results.\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products or brands, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including numerous patents and registered trademarks, as well as our licensed intellectual property to market, promote and sell our products. We will monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the patent, trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly those of certain emerging markets, will provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. and present greater risks of counterfeiting and other infringement. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nAdverse judgments in regulatory actions, product claims, environmental claims and other litigation could be costly. Insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While we will strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements, and that our products perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet warranty or contractual requirements, or were improperly installed and users could claim to be harmed by use or misuse of our products. These claims could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. They could also result in negative publicity.\nIn addition, claims and investigations may arise related to patent infringement, distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues, data privacy and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. For example, we are currently a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace, or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants. In some cases, these allegations involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we will not be able to predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact. We cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of labor, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of U.S. and international labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. A significant portion of our manufacturing employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also subject to the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation. Prolonged negotiations, conflicts or related activities could also lead to costly work stoppages and loss of productivity.\nWe outsource our information technology infrastructure which makes us more dependent upon third parties.\nIn an effort to make our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) functions more efficient, increase related capabilities, as well as generate cost savings, we outsource a significant portion of our IT infrastructure to a third party service provider. As a result, we rely on the third party to ensure that our related needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over certain processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results and potentially, termination of provisions of these services by our supplier. A failure of our service provider to perform may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nOur stock price has experienced price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. We, the flooring industry and the stock market have experienced stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to operating performance.\nA stockholder's percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nA stockholder's percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our Board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022a provision that directors serving on a classified board may be removed by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board.\nIn addition, because we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), this provision could also delay or prevent a change in control that stockholders may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and the provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of AFI and its stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nRisks Related to the Separation from AWI\nIf the Separation and Distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nAWI received an opinion of AWI\u2019s tax counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinion, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Separation and Distribution should qualify as a transaction that generally is tax-free to AWI and AWI\u2019s shareholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nNotwithstanding the tax opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the Distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. If the Distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend to shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liability. In addition, AWI and/or we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with AWI, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution are taxable.\nWe will be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to AWI or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from AWI.\nUnder the terms of the Separation and Distribution, we will indemnify AWI from and after the Separation and Distribution with respect to (i) all debts, liabilities and obligations allocated or transferred to us in connection with the Separation and Distribution (including our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such debts, liabilities or obligations after the Separation and Distribution); (ii) any misstatement or omission of a material fact in our Information Statement, dated March 24, 2016, resulting in a misleading statement; (iii) any breach by us of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Campus Lease Agreement or the Trademark License Agreements; and (iv) our ownership and operation of our business. We are not aware of any existing indemnification obligations at this time, but any such indemnification obligations that may arise could be significant. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, AWI will indemnify us from and after the Separation and Distribution with respect to (i) all debts, liabilities and obligations allocated to AWI after the Separation and Distribution (including its failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such debts, liabilities or obligations after the Separation and Distribution); (ii) any breach by AWI of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Campus Lease Agreement or the Trademark License Agreements; and (iii) AWI\u2019s ownership and operation of its business. Our and AWI\u2019s ability to satisfy these indemnities, if called upon to do so, will depend upon our and AWI\u2019s future financial strength. If we are required to indemnify AWI, or if we are not able to collect on indemnification rights from AWI, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot determine whether we will have to indemnify AWI, or if AWI will have to indemnify us, for any substantial obligations after the Distribution.", "PERMNO": 15956, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "AFI"}
