{"cik": "849146", "company": "Lifevantage Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nBecause of the following risks, as well as other risks affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks described below are those we currently believe could materially affect us. The following risks are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements in this report.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Company\nBecause our Japanese operations account for a significant part of our business, an inability to strengthen our business and properly manage distractions among our distributors in Japan could harm our business.\nApproximately 22% and 29% of our revenue for fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014, respectively, was generated in Japan. We began selling our products into the market in fiscal year 2010 and opened fully supported operations in Japan in fiscal year 2013. Due to our limited experience in Japan, the initiatives we have implemented, or that we may implement in the future,\n- 15-\nmay not be successful in galvanizing and motivating our leading independent distributors and we may be unable to retain existing leading independent distributors in Japan. There has been discord among our leading independent distributors in Japan and some of these distributors have left our company to join a competing direct selling company. If we fail to properly manage any discord among our leading independent distributors in Japan, we could lose additional leaders to competing direct selling companies, which could have a significant negative impact on our revenue.\nIn addition, the regulatory framework in Japan has changed since we first started selling into the market. In fiscal year 2013, for example, we announced the release for the Japanese market of a new formulation of Protandim\u00ae in response to the determination of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, that one of the ingredients in Protandim\u00ae is inappropriate for inclusion in a food product in Japan. Our business in Japan could be substantially harmed if this formulation of Protandim\u00ae faces additional challenges from regulatory agencies in Japan or if it does not gain the acceptance that the original formulation has obtained in other markets.\nOther factors that could impact our results in Japan include:\n\u2022\ninappropriate activities by our independent distributors and any resulting regulatory actions against us or our independent distributors;\n\u2022\ncontinued or increased levels of regulatory or media scrutiny of our industry and any regulatory actions, or any adoption of more restrictive regulations, in response to such scrutiny;\n\u2022\nsignificant weakening of the Japanese yen;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory constraints with respect to the claims we can make regarding the efficacy of our products, which could limit our ability to effectively market our products;\n\u2022\nimproper practices of other direct selling companies or their independent distributors that increase regulatory or media scrutiny of our industry; and\n\u2022\nweakness in the economy or consumer confidence.\nThere is a high level of regulatory scrutiny of the direct selling industry in Japan, and several direct selling companies have been penalized for actions of distributors that violated applicable regulations. Such penalties have included suspension from sponsoring activities in Japan. If our distributors fail to comply with applicable regulations in Japan, regulators could take action against us, including a suspension of our sponsoring activities, or we could receive negative media attention, either of which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our operations.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our operations. Although we began to sell our products through our direct selling network in fiscal year 2009, we still have limited experience in selling our products through direct selling compared to other companies in our industry. As such, we may have limited insight into trends, disruptions and other factors that may emerge and affect our business. For example, we may need to terminate one or more of our independent distributors for actions contrary to their contractual obligations with us, which may slow our growth by causing a disruption among our independent distributors. Additionally, we may not be successful in keeping our leading independent distributors focused and motivated or in aligning their goals with the goals of our company. We also have limited experience expanding into new geographic markets. Although we are seeking to continue our expansion, if we fail to effectively expand our operations into additional markets, we may be unable to generate consistent operating profit growth in future periods.\nIf we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nOur business has grown significantly since we initiated our direct selling model in fiscal 2009. This growth placed substantial strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. If we are able to continue expanding our operations in the United States and in other countries where we believe our products will be successful, such expansion could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. In addition, an inability to leverage our current resources in an efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating margins and results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in growing existing markets or opening new markets.\nWe have international operations in Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, Philippines, Mexico and Thailand. In fiscal 2015, we generated approximately 30% of our revenues from our international operations, most of which was generated from Japan. We believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to effectively expand into new international markets. In some of our international markets, we have experienced unexpected difficulties that have resulted in slower than anticipated growth. We may not succeed in growing our existing international markets, entering new international markets on a\n- 16-\ntimely basis, or achieving profitability in new markets. We must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any international market. Also, before marketing commences in a new country or market, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant regulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere. We may be required to reformulate one or more of our products, including Protandim\u00ae, before commencing sales of that product in a given country. Once we have entered a market, we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. We may not be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets, or we may have insufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner.\nInability of new products to gain distributor or market acceptance could harm our business.\nIn fiscal 2015, we introduced Axio\u00ae, our energy drink mix formulated to promote alertness and support mental performance. We believe our ability to introduce new products that gain acceptance among our distributors and customers is an important part of our ability to grow our revenue in future periods. However, any new products we introduce may not gain distributor and market acceptance to the extent we anticipate or project. Factors that could affect our ability to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. In addition, new products we introduce may not be successful or generate substantial revenue. The introduction of a new product could also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our distributor leaders focus their efforts on the new product instead of an existing product. If any of our products fail to gain distributor acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to execute our product launch process due to increased pressure on our supply chain, information systems and management.\nAlthough our product launch process may vary by market, we generally introduce new products to our independent distributors and preferred customers through limited-time offers and promotions. The limited-time offers typically generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which may result in a higher than normal increase in revenue during the quarter of the limited-time offer and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. We may experience difficulty effectively managing growth associated with these limited-time offers. In addition, the size and condensed schedule of these product launches increases pressure on our supply chain. If we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market, obtain sufficient ingredients or produce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our independent distributors and preferred customers. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations for a product launch, we could incur increased inventory write-offs. Any inventory write-off would negatively impact our gross margins. In addition, our order processing systems could have difficulties handling the high volume of orders generated by limited-time offers. Although our previous limited-time offers have not materially affected our product return rate, these events may increase our product return rate in the future.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption in these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our information technology, or IT, systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, including our finance and accounting transactions, to manage our independent distributor compensation plan and to provide analytical information to management. Our IT systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses. Any disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if we experience future growth, we will need to scale or change some of our systems to accommodate the increasing number of independent distributors and other customers. For example, we are in the process of implementing a new back office system and mobile application to be used by our independent distributors. The implementation of the new back office system is a complicated process that will take multiple years to complete. In addition, we may not be successful in implementing a mobile application that our independent distributors find useful. Our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unable to successfully implement the new back office system or if our independent distributors do not adapt well to the new system or mobile application.\n- 17-\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of data belonging to our company, employees, independent distributors and preferred customers could expose us to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of data relating to our business and from our employees, independent distributors and preferred customers for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business. We are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the credit card industry. Maintaining compliance with these evolving regulations and requirements could be difficult and may increase our expenses. In addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of data relating to our company or our employees, independent distributors or preferred customers, which could harm our reputation, disrupt our operations, or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits.\nOur credit facility includes debt service obligations and restrictive covenants that could impede our operations and flexibility.\nWe entered into a Financing Agreement in October 2013 that provides for a credit facility consisting of a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $47 million and a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20 million (the \"Financing Agreement\"). At the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the principal amount owing under the credit facility was approximately $22 million. The principal amount borrowed under the credit facility is repayable in consecutive quarterly installments. We expect to generate the cash necessary to pay the principal and interest on the credit facility from our cash flows provided by operating activities. However, our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by financial, business, economic, demographic and other factors. If we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise cash through the sale of equity. In such an event, we may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise cash through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us or at all. Also, our ability to carry out any of these activities on favorable terms, if at all, may be further impacted by any financial or credit crisis which may limit access to the credit markets and increase the cost of capital.\nThe credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, and the assets of our subsidiaries, and contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on and redeem capital stock, make other payments, including investments, sell our assets and enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of our assets. The credit facility includes financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet these ratios and tests. A breach of any of the covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions imposed by the credit facility would result in an event of default and the lender could declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay the indebtedness if the lenders accelerate our repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility.\nWe may not be able to comply with the financial covenants set forth in the Financing Agreement.\nThe Financing Agreement we entered into in October 2013 contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. For example, the Financing Agreement originally required us to have a minimum consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2015 of at least $20.6 million. We were not in compliance with this financial covenant at March 31, 2015 and we entered into Amendment No. 1 to Financing Agreement on May 1, 2015 (the \"Amendment\") to remedy our noncompliance and to establish a lower EBITDA covenant for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015. The Amendment, however, did not revise the required minimum consolidated EBITDA for periods subsequent to June 30, 2015.\nOn August 27, 2015 we entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Financing Agreement (\"Amendment No. 2\"). Amendment No. 2 revised the covenants related to minimum consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the amended Financing Agreement) for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2015, December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 from $22.2 million, $23.1 million, $24.4 million and $25.6 million, respectively, to $14.5 million, $15.0 million, $17.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively. In addition, Amendment No. 2 requires that we make additional monthly accelerated principal payments on our outstanding term loan in the amount of $0.5 million commencing on October 15, 2015 and continuing until the term loan has been paid in full. Amendment No. 2 also requires that we make additional accelerated payments at the end of each calendar quarter in the amount of all unrestricted cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of the quarter in excess of $12.5 million. If we are unable to further amend the Financing Agreement or significantly increase our revenue and manage our expenses, our consolidated EBITDA may not exceed the minimum consolidated EBITDA required by the Financing Agreement\n- 18-\nand, as a result, an event of default would exist under the Financing Agreement for which our lender could accelerate our repayment of the indebtedness.\nOur independent distributors could fail to comply with applicable legal requirements or our distributor policies and procedures, which could result in claims against us that could harm our business.\nOur independent distributors are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if distributors were employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our distributors will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our distributor policies and procedures.\nExtensive federal, state, local and international laws regulate our business, products and direct selling activities. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our independent distributors differ slightly in some countries due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. While our distributor policies and procedures are designed to govern distributor conduct, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of distributors and their independent status. Violations by our independent distributors of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent distributors. In the past, we have had independent distributors investigated by government agencies for conduct violating the law and our policies. This type of investigation can have an adverse effect on us even if we are not involved in the independent distributor's activities.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign markets, exposing us to the risks of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, increased tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations, disruptions or conflicts with our third party importers and similar risks associated with foreign operations.\nA substantial portion of our sales are generated outside the United States. If we are successful in entering additional foreign markets, we anticipate that the percentage of our sales generated outside the United States will increase. There are substantial risks associated with foreign operations. For example, a foreign government may impose trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs, which could negatively impact our operations and financial results. We are also exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. For instance, in preparing our financial statements, we translate revenue and expenses in our markets outside the United States from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, our reported revenue, gross profit and net income will likely be reduced. Foreign currency fluctuations can also result in losses and gains resulting from translation of foreign currency denominated balances on our balance sheet. Additionally, purchases from suppliers are generally made in U.S. dollars while sales to distributors are generally made in local currencies. Accordingly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency could have a negative impact on us. Specifically, because a significant percentage of our revenues are generated in Japan, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our financial results. Although we may engage in transactions intended to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be effective. Given the complex global political and economic dynamics that affect exchange rate fluctuations, it is difficult to predict future fluctuations and the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results or our overall financial condition.\nAdditionally, we may be negatively impacted by conflicts with or disruptions caused or faced by third party importers, as well as conflicts between such importers and local governments or regulatory agencies. Our operations in some markets also may be adversely affected by political, economic and social instability in foreign countries.\nGlobal economic conditions could harm our business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging and unpredictable. Consumer confidence and spending have declined in recent years and the global credit crisis has limited access to capital for many companies and consumers. The global economic downturn could adversely impact our business by causing a decline in demand for our products, particularly if the economic conditions are prolonged or worsen. In addition, poor global economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease our independent distributors\u2019 ability to obtain or maintain credit, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain our level of internal controls, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price could suffer.\nWe have implemented internal controls to help ensure the accuracy of our financial reporting and have implemented internal controls to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We regularly audit our internal controls and various aspects of our business and we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. There can be no assurance, however,\n- 19-\nthat these internal or external assessments and audits will identify all significant or material weaknesses in our internal controls. Any failure to correct a weakness in internal controls could result in the disclosure of a material weakness. If a material weakness results in a material misstatement in our financial results, we may also have to restate our financial statements.\nIf we are to expand our product offerings, we may need to raise additional capital.\nAlthough we introduced additional products in each of fiscal 2014 and 2015, we primarily depend on Protandim\u00ae for our revenue. We may decide to expand our product portfolio and may seek to do so by acquiring products by license or through product or company acquisitions. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our requirements in this regard, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional required capital in a timely manner, we could be forced to reduce our growth plans.\nWe could be exposed to certain environmental liabilities due to our past operations and property ownership.\nDuring the 1990s, we owned mining properties in the Yaak River mining district of Montana. We never conducted any mining operations or ore processing on these properties, nor have we performed on-site environmental studies on these properties. The State of Montana Department of Environmental Quality believed that the properties may contain residues from past mining. We may be liable for material environmental liabilities associated with these properties.\nIn addition, until November 2004, we owned land in Lawrence, Colorado. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities with respect to this land. The party that acquired the land from us assumed any environmental liability related to the land. Nonetheless, a governmental agency or a private party could seek to hold us accountable for such environmental liabilities, if any.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe primarily depend on a single product for our revenue.\nAlthough we generate revenue through the sale of Canine Health\u00ae, our line of LifeVantage TrueScience\u00ae skin care products and Axio\u00ae, we primarily rely on the sale of Protandim\u00ae for our revenue. We do not have a broad portfolio of other products that we could rely on to support our operations if we were to experience any difficulty with the manufacture, marketing, sale or distribution of Protandim\u00ae. For example, our revenue was adversely impacted because sales of Protandim\u00ae slowed following our voluntary product recall during fiscal 2013. If we have similar problems in the future, our results could be negatively affected. In addition, we may be unable to sustain or increase the price or sales levels for Protandim\u00ae, which could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing independent distributors or attract additional independent distributors, our revenue will not increase and may even decline.\nOur independent distributors may terminate their services at any time, and we can and have in the past terminated distributors for conduct violative of our policies and procedures. As such, like most direct selling companies, we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience turnover among independent distributors. The departure for any reason of one of our leading independent distributors can be a major disruption to other independent distributors and can have a significant negative impact on our operating results. Independent distributors who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short-term income goals may only stay with us for a short time. While we take steps to help train, motivate, and retain independent distributors, we cannot accurately predict the number or productivity of our independent distributors.\nOur operating results will be harmed if we and our independent distributor leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business to retain existing independent distributors and attract new independent distributors. The number and productivity of our independent distributors could be harmed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nany adverse publicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channel, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nlack of interest in existing or new products or their failure to achieve desired results;\n\u2022\nlack of a compelling business opportunity sufficient to generate the interest and commitment of new independent distributors;\n\u2022\nany changes we might make to our independent distributor compensation plan;\n\u2022\nany negative public perception of our company or our products or their ingredients;\n\u2022\nany negative public perception of our independent distributors and direct selling business in general;\n\u2022\nour actions to enforce our policies and procedures;\n- 20-\n\u2022\nany efforts to sell our products through competitive channels;\n\u2022\nany regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nHigh quality material for our products may be difficult to obtain or expensive.\nRaw materials account for a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and we rely on third-party suppliers to provide raw materials. Suppliers may be unable or unwilling to provide the raw materials our manufacturers need in the quantities requested, at a price we are willing to pay, or that meet our quality standards. We are also subject to potential delays in the delivery of raw materials caused by events beyond our control, including labor disputes, transportation interruptions and changes in government regulations. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain a reliable source of any of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products that meets our quality standards. Additionally, if demand for our products exceeds our forecasts, we may have difficulties in obtaining additional raw materials in time to meet the excess demand. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could, among other things, substantially increase the cost of such materials, require reformulation or repackaging of products, require the qualification of new suppliers, or result in our inability to meet customer demands.\nAlthough our independent distributors are independent contractors, improper distributor actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business.\nOur independent distributors are not employees and act independent of us. However, activities by our independent distributors that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third-party actions against us, which could harm our business. Our independent distributors agree to abide by our strict policies and procedures designed to ensure our independent distributors will comply with legal requirements. We have a compliance department that addresses violations of our independent distributors when they become known to us. However, given the size of our independent distributor network, we experience problems with independent distributors violating our policies and procedures from time to time and are not always able to discover or remedy such violations.\nOne of our most significant areas of risk with respect to independent distributor activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of being an independent distributor. Any determination by the Federal Trade Commission, any state agency or other similar governmental agency outside the United States that we or our independent distributors are not in compliance with applicable laws could materially harm our business. Even if governmental actions do not result in rulings or orders against us, they could create negative publicity that could detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate independent distributors and attract customers or lead to consumer lawsuits against us. As we experience growth in the number of our independent distributors, we have seen an increase in sales aids and promotional material being produced by distributors and distributor groups in some markets. This places an increased burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increases the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. As we expand internationally, our distributors sometimes attempt to anticipate additional new markets that we may enter in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines or other legal action if our distributors violate applicable laws and regulations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties to manufacture our product.\nWe currently rely on third parties to manufacture the products we sell. We are dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of third party manufacturers\u2019 facilities. We currently have multiple third-party contractors who manufacture Protandim\u00ae, however we currently only have one third-party contractor who manufacturers each of Canine Health\u00ae, our line of LifeVantage TrueScience\u00ae skin care products and Axio\u00ae. If any of our current manufacturers are unable or unwilling to fulfill our manufacturing requirements or seek to impose unfavorable terms, we will likely have to seek out other manufacturers, which could disrupt our operations and we may not be successful in finding alternative manufacturing resources. In addition, competitors who perform their own manufacturing may have an advantage over us with respect to pricing, availability of product, and in other areas through their control of the manufacturing process.\nDisruptions to transportation channels used to distribute our products may adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nWe generally rely on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of third-party logistics companies to transport and deliver our products. These third-party logistics companies may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, and a shortage of manpower. Disruptions to the transportation channels experienced by our third party logistics companies may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand.\n- 21-\nWe are subject to risks related to product recalls.\nWe have implemented measures in our manufacturing process that are designed to prevent and detect defects in our products, including contaminants. However, such measures may not prevent or reveal defects or detect contaminants in our products and such defects and contaminants may not become apparent until after our products have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, or that our products will contain foreign contaminants, and that such defects and contaminants will require a product recall. We do not maintain product recall insurance. In December 2012, we commenced a voluntary recall of certain lots of Protandim\u00ae to alleviate concerns that some tablets may have included small metal fragments. We discovered these small metal fragments in certain batches of turmeric extract, an ingredient in Protandim\u00ae we purchase from third-party suppliers. Product recalls and subsequent remedial actions can be expensive to implement and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product recalls could result in negative publicity and public concerns regarding the safety of our products, either of which could harm the reputation of our products and our business and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nThe events that lead to and followed our voluntary product recall in December 2012 strained our relationships with some of our third-party manufacturers. Additionally, following the voluntary recall we implemented more stringent measures, including several redundant measures, in our manufacturing process to detect contaminates. Third-party manufacturers may be reluctant to implement these redundant measures, may refuse to manufacture our products, and these additional measures may increase our cost of goods sold and further strain our relationships with manufacturers.\nLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that negatively impact our business.\nVarious government agencies throughout the world regulate direct selling practices. The laws and regulations applicable to us and our independent distributors in Japan are particularly stringent. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid\u201d schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on the sale of product to end consumers. The laws and regulations in some of our markets impose cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off rights for our independent distributors and customers. Excessive refunds and/or product returns pursuant to local laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our operating results. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part. We may not be able to continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets if we are unable to comply with these laws or adjust to changes in these laws.\nUnfavorable publicity could materially harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumers' perceptions of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, as well as competitive products distributed by other companies. In the past, we have experienced negative publicity that has harmed our business. Critics of our industry and other individuals whose interests are not aligned with our interests, have in the past and may in the future utilize the Internet, the press and other means to publish criticism of the industry, our company, our products and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. For instance, several prominent companies in our industry have been targeted by short sellers who profit if a company's stock price decreases. One such company has been targeted by a short seller who, after taking a significant short position, publicly made allegations regarding the legality of the company's direct selling model. Short sellers have an incentive to publicly criticize our industry and business model and any such criticism may adversely affect our stock price.\nFuture scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to our industry or any particular product, including Protandim\u00ae. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting or claimed to have resulted from the consumption or use of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on us. Such adverse publicity could arise even if the claims are unsubstantiated or if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from failure to consume or use such products as directed. Adverse publicity could also increase our product liability exposure, result in increased regulatory scrutiny and lead to the initiation of private lawsuits.\nOur direct selling program could be found to be not in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets, which could prevent us from conducting our business in these markets and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nSome of the legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling business model are ambiguous and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. Recent allegations by short sellers regarding the legality of multi-level marketing companies generally have also created intense public scrutiny of our industry and could cause governmental agencies to change their enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws and\n- 22-\nregulations. The failure of our business to comply with current or newly adopted regulations or interpretations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general and may adversely affect our share price.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming and, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nLitigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of litigation which we may in the future become party to; the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\nWe are currently involved in various lawsuits, both as a plaintiff and as defendant. While we believe the suits against us are without merit, they are quite costly to defend and we cannot be assured that we will ultimately prevail. If we do not prevail and are required to pay damages, it could harm our business.\nGovernment authorities may question our tax positions or transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to various tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our company and our subsidiaries. From time to time, we are audited by tax regulators in the United States and in our foreign markets. If regulators challenge our tax positions, corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transfers, we may be subject to fines and payment of back taxes, our effective tax rate may increase and our operations may be harmed. Tax rates vary from country to country, and, if tax authorities determine that our profits in one jurisdiction may need to be increased, we may not be able to fully utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated, which will increase our effective tax rate. For example, our federal corporate income tax rate in the United States is 35%. If our profitability in a higher tax jurisdiction, such as Japan where our tax rate in fiscal 2015 was approximately 37%, increases disproportionately to the rest of our business, our effective tax rate may increase. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing and are subject to the interpretation of government agencies. We may experience increased efforts by customs authorities in foreign countries to reclassify our products or otherwise increase the level of duties we pay on our products. Despite our efforts to be aware of and comply with such laws, and changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a risk that we may not continue to operate in compliance with such laws. We may need to adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes and, as a result, our business may suffer. In addition, due to the international nature of our business, we are subject from time to time to reviews and audits by taxing authorities of other jurisdictions in which we conduct business throughout the world.\nOur business is subject to strict government regulations.\nThe manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, sale and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including, in the United States, the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing or dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs and other dietary ingredients for human use). Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues, increased costs and delay our expansion into new international markets. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use).\nThe FDA may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient is adulterated or misbranded or both, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we make to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a \u201chealth claim.\u201d Determining whether a claim is improper frequently involves a degree of subjectivity. Any of these determinations by the FDA could prevent us from marketing that particular dietary supplement product, or making certain claims for that product. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any product that we are required to remove from the market, which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. In recent years, there has been increased pressure in the United States and other markets to increase regulation of dietary supplements. New regulations could impose additional restrictions, including requiring reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation,\n- 23-\nadditional adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. In the United States, for example, some legislators and industry critics continue to push for increased regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. Our business could be harmed if more restrictive legislation is successfully introduced and adopted in the future. In the United States, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or Guides, require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing and generally do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our independent distributors have historically used testimonials to market and sell our products. Producing marketing materials that conform to the requirements and restrictions of the Guides may diminish the impact of our marketing efforts and negatively impact our sales results. If we or our distributors fail to comply with these Guides, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our marketing materials. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies or require us to reformulate our products.\nIn addition, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements, packers and distributors including the reporting of \u201cserious adverse events\u201d to the FDA and record keeping requirements. Complying with this legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. We and our suppliers are also required to comply with FDA regulations with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with procedures that we and our subcontractors must develop and make available for inspection by the FDA. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to comply with these rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. In 2011, the FDA published draft guidance which is intended, among other things, to help manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplement products determine when they are required to file with the FDA a New Dietary Ingredient, or NDI, notification with respect to a dietary supplement product. In this draft guidance, the FDA highlighted the necessity for marketers of dietary supplements to submit NDI notifications as an important preventive control to ensure that consumers are not exposed to potential unnecessary public health risks in the form of new ingredients with unknown safety profiles. Although we do not believe that Protandim\u00ae contains an NDI, if the FDA were to conclude that we should have filed an NDI notification for Protandim\u00ae, then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA. Such enforcement actions could include product seizures and injunctive relief being granted against us, any of which would harm our business.\nRegulations governing the production and marketing of our line of skin care products could harm our business.\nLifeVantage TrueScience\u00ae, our line of anti-aging skin care products, is subject to various domestic and foreign laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can be marketed as a \u201ccosmetic\u201d or requires further approval as a drug. A determination that our skin care products impact the structure or function of the human body, including due to improper marketing claims by our independent distributors may lead to a determination that the LifeVantage TrueScience\u00ae skin care products require pre-market approval as a drug. Such regulations in any given market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action against us and we could be fined, forced to alter or stop selling our skin care products and/or be required to adjust our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our skin care products or impose additional burdens or requirements on the contents of our personal care products or require us to reformulate our products.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigatory and enforcement action by the FTC.\nWe are subject to the risk of investigatory and enforcement action by the FTC based on our advertising claims and marketing practices. The FTC routinely reviews product advertising, including websites, to identify significant questionable advertising claims and practices. The FTC has brought many actions against dietary supplement companies based upon allegations that applicable advertising claims or practices were deceptive or not substantiated. If the FTC initiates an investigation, the FTC can initiate pre-complaint discovery that may be nonpublic in nature. Any investigation may be very expensive to defend and may result in an adverse ruling or in a consent decree.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nOur international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, also known as the FCPA. Any allegations that we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial\n- 24-\nfines, and other penalties. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and controls to protect against violation of these laws, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective.\nIf we are unable to build and integrate our new management team, our business could be harmed.\nSince February 2015, our executive management team has undergone significant change, including the termination or resignation from employment of each of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Sales Officer, Chief Science Officer and General Counsel. In addition, in May 2015, Darren Jensen joined our company as our new President and Chief Executive Officer; in July 2015, Justin Rose was appointed as our Chief Sales Officer and in August 2015, Mark Jaggi became our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur success depends largely on the development and execution of our business strategy by our senior management team. Each of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Sales Officer and Chief Financial Officer is new to our Company and none of them have worked together in the recent past. We cannot assure you that our new management will succeed in working together as a team, working well with our other existing employees or successfully executing our business strategy in the near-term or at all, which could harm our business and financial prospects. Further, integrating new management into existing operations may be challenging. If we are unable to effectively integrate our new executive management team, our operations and prospects could be harmed.\nThe loss of or inability to attract key personnel could negatively impact our business.\nOur future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management team and scientific staff. Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team and scientific staff, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain additional qualified management and scientific staff in the future. Specifically, competition for executive and senior staff in the direct selling and dietary supplement markets is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel. Additionally, former members of our executive and senior management team have in the past, and could join in the future or form companies that compete against us in the direct selling industry.\nAll of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees, which means any employee may quit at any time and we may terminate any employee at any time. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance covering members of senior management or our employees.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent distributors, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur distributors are subject to taxation, and in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records. In the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or that our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. If our distributors were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors, we would also face the threat of increased vicarious liability for their actions.\nThe dietary supplement market is highly competitive.\nOur flagship product, Protandim\u00ae, competes in the dietary supplements market, which is large, highly competitive and fragmented. Participants include specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations, on-line merchants, mail-order companies, and a variety of other smaller participants. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess better manufacturing, independent distribution and marketing capabilities than we do. We believe some of these competitors with greater resources are currently working on developing and releasing products that will compete directly with Protandim\u00ae and be marketed as Nrf2 activators. One or more of these products could significantly reduce the demand for Protandim\u00ae and have a material adverse effect on our revenue. We believe that the market is also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, including various prescription drugs, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. Moreover, because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of dietary supplements, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 products, and competing products entering the dietary supplements market could harm our revenue. In the United States and Japan, we also compete for sales with heavily advertised national brands manufactured by large pharmaceutical and food companies, as well as other retailers. In addition, as some products become more mainstream, we experience increased competition for those products as more participants enter the market. Our international competitors include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket chains, and other large U.S.-based companies with international operations. We may not be able to\n- 25-\ncompete effectively and our attempt to do so may result in increased pricing pressure, which may result in lower margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brand.\nThe loss of our intellectual property rights in our products could permit our competitors to manufacture their own version of our products. We have attempted to protect our intellectual property rights in our products through a combination of patents, patent applications, confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and other contractual protection mechanisms, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents or various contractual protections may not adequately protect our intellectual property. In addition, we could be required to expend significant resources to defend our rights to proprietary information, and may not be successful in such defense.\nMoreover, our intellectual property rights are more limited outside of the United States than they are in the United States. As such, we may not be successful in preventing third parties from copying or misappropriating our intellectual property. There can also be no assurance that pending patent applications owned by us will result in patents being issued to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that such patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our products or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate to obtain licenses to conduct our business, and any required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on confidentiality and non-compete agreements with certain employees, independent distributors, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\nThird parties might claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.\nAlthough the dietary supplement industry has historically been characterized by products with naturally occurring ingredients, recently it is becoming more common for suppliers and competitors to apply for patents or develop proprietary technologies and processes. Third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us despite our efforts to avoid such infringement. Such claims could prevent us from offering competitive products or result in litigation or threatened litigation.\nOur business is susceptible to product liability claims.\nThe manufacture and sale of any product for human consumption raises the risk of product liability claims. These claims may derive from the product itself or a contaminant found in the product from the manufacturing, packaging, sales process or even due to tampering by unauthorized third parties. Our products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. Our products could contain contaminated substances, and some of our products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. In addition, third-party manufacturers produce all of the products we sell. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, we may also be liable for various product liability claims for these products despite not manufacturing them. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. Any product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues and operating income. Although we maintain insurance coverage, there is a risk that our insurance will not cover our potential exposure completely or would fail to cover a particular claim, in which case we may not have the financial resources to satisfy such claim. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by our insurance policy.\nEconomic, political, and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our revenues and international growth prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to expand our international presence. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to operating in foreign countries, and any expansion of our international operations will increase the effects of these risks. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability of foreign markets;\n\u2022\nforeign governments\u2019 restrictive trade policies;\n\u2022\nlack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas in which we operate;\n- 26-\n\u2022\ninconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of, or increase in, duties, taxes, government royalties, or non-tariff trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a foreign government may limit our ability to repatriate cash;\n\u2022\nincreased costs in maintaining international marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nproblems entering international markets with different cultural bases and consumer preferences; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and our growth strategy.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe failure to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in delisting and adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market we are required to meet its continued listing standards, including, among others, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d).\nOn April 1, 2015, we received a written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we had not been in compliance with the Bid Price Rule for a period of 30 consecutive days. The notice has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 days from the date of the written notice, or until September 28, 2015, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. To regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180 day compliance period. If we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule during the compliance period ending September 28, 2015, we may be afforded a second compliance period of 180 days if we (i) meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Bid Price Rule, and (ii) notify Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency.\nWe may be unable to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule during the compliance period(s), in which case we anticipate Nasdaq will commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock is delisted, trading of our common stock most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, such as the OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading would likely reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock and the price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nOur stock price may experience future volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been subject to wide fluctuations. The price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the dietary supplement industry, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control, and some of which do not have a strong correlation to our operating performance.\nSubstantial sales of shares may impact the market price of our common stock.\nIf our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we consider appropriate.\nWe would issue up to 3.8 million shares if the holders of our outstanding warrants and options exercise their securities for shares of common stock, which would materially dilute the voting power of our currently outstanding common stock and could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had 97.7 million shares of common stock outstanding. As of June 30, 2015, we also had outstanding warrants that are exercisable for an aggregate of 0.6 million shares of common stock and stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 3.2 million shares of common stock. The issuance of these shares will dilute the voting power of our currently outstanding common stock and could cause our stock price to decline.\n- 27-\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date. Although during fiscal 2015 we paid an aggregate of $9.9 million to repurchase 7.6 million shares of our common stock, we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Additionally, the Financing Agreement we entered into in October 2013 contains a customary covenant that restricts our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock is likely to be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 13599, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "LFVN"}
