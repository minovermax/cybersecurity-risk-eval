{"cik": "19446", "company": "CANTEL MEDICAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our businesses and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect us. We provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our businesses, which we believe are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, or could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, many of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and are well-established. Some competitors have developed or may be expected to develop technologies or products that could compete with our products or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, our competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval or product commercialization that would limit our ability to compete with them. See \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nAdditionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development, new product introductions and product enhancements, rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. Accordingly, our ability to compete is in part dependent on our ability to continually offer enhanced and improved products that meet the changing requirements of our customers. As such, we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe face increased competition in the water purification system market due to the alliance of kidney dialysis machine suppliers and water purification system suppliers.\nOutside of the United States, we believe there is a trend in formal or informal bundling partnerships and arrangements between kidney dialysis machine suppliers and companies offering medical water purification systems that compete with our systems. The ability to bundle these products offers a competitive advantage to such suppliers, which include Baxter (dialysis machine)/Gambro (water system), B. Braun (dialysis machine)/Lauer (water system), and Fresenius (dialysis machine)/Vivonic (water system). The bundling approach is now being used in the United States by B. Braun/Lauer and represents a competitive threat to our dialysis water business.\nThe market for our dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers. The decrease in the reuse portion of the dialysis market in the United States accelerated significantly during fiscal 2016 and such decrease is expected to continue.\nOur dialyzer reprocessing products are limited to use by centers that choose to clean, sterilize and reuse dialyzers, rather than discard the dialyzers after a single-use. We believe dialysis centers in the United States that reuse dialyzers derive an economic benefit since the per-procedure cost is less when utilizing dialyzer reuse compared with single-use and such dialysis clinics generally receive a capitated payment for providing hemodialysis treatment. Although current public information is not available to accurately quantify the number of dialysis centers currently employing dialyzer reuse versus single-use, it is apparent that the market share of single-use dialyzers has been increasing since 2001 relative to reuse dialyzers. We believe that less than 12% of all dialysis procedures in the United States currently reuse dialyzers, although there is no independent information available to verify that approximation.\nSince 2001, there has been a continuing shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers, principally due to the decreasing cost of single-use dialyzers, the ease of using a dialyzer one time, and the conversion of reuse facilities to single-use facilities by the largest dialysis provider chains in the United States. Most recently, DaVita, the second largest dialysis provider chain has been converting a growing number of clinics from reuse to single-use and opening new clinics as single-use clinics. As a result, the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States accelerated during fiscal 2016 and may continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter.\nThe reduction of our dialysis reuse business has had an adverse effect on our dialysis segment business and reduced our margins and net income in that segment. However, such effect was significantly mitigated by increased sales in our dialysate concentrate sales during fiscal 2016, which sales are anticipated to remain relatively strong during fiscal 2017.\nNet sales of our Dialysis segment accounted for 4.9% of our total net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with 5.5% of net sales in fiscal 2015 and 6.3% of net sales in fiscal 2014. Our Dialysis segment accounted for 6.4%, 6.8%, and 8.7% of our total reporting segments\u2019 operating income (before general corporate expenses and interest expense) in fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This reduction in percentage of total sales is expected to continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter primarily due to reduced purchases of dialysis reuse products combined with the organic growth of our segments other than Dialysis and the effect on our future results of operations from acquisitions. See \u201cBusiness - Principal Customers,\u201d \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe face significant challenges in growing our dialysate concentrate sales.\nAlthough prior to fiscal 2014, sales of dialysate concentrate generally declined from year to year, such trend stopped toward the end of fiscal 2015 when we began manufacturing concentrate for a large national distributor of these products. As a result of sales to this distributor, dialysate concentrate sales increased in fiscal 2015 and again in fiscal 2016. We anticipate that relatively strong sales of these products will continue during fiscal 2017 and mitigate to some extent the anticipated decrease in sales of dialysis reuse products. However, no assurance can be given that we will succeed at increasing sales in the near or long term. Fresenius manufactures dialysate concentrate itself and therefore provides dialysate concentrate to its own dialysis clinics. DaVita and certain international customers have also continued their reduction of dialysate concentrate purchases from us as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfor such product. In addition, there is increased demand in the market for powdered dialysate products, which we do not manufacture, principally due to the lower freight costs associated with the powdered products.\nBecause a significant portion of our Water Purification and Filtration, Dialysis and Healthcare Disposables segments net sales comes from a few large customers, any significant decrease in sales to these customers, due to industry consolidation or otherwise, could harm our operating results.\nIn our Water Purification and Filtration segment, two customers, Fresenius and DaVita, collectively accounted for 43.7% of our fiscal 2016 net sales for this segment. The loss of a significant amount of business from either of these two customers would have a material adverse effect on our Water Purification and Filtration segment.\nDuring fiscal 2016, Fresenius and DaVita accounted for 42.6% of the Dialysis segment net sales. We are highly dependent on Fresenius and DaVita and any material shift by these customers away from reuse would have a material adverse effect on our Dialysis segment net sales except to the extent we successfully mitigate the loss of U.S. reuse business with increased foreign business, the successful commercialization of new or acquired products and increased sales of dialysate.\nThe distribution network in the United States dental industry is concentrated, with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists. Accordingly, net sales and profitability of our Healthcare Disposables segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors. During fiscal 2016, the top four customers of our Healthcare Disposables segment accounted for 49.1% of its net sales. The loss or a significant reduction of business from any of the major customers of the Healthcare Disposables segment could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, because our Healthcare Disposables segment products are primarily sold through third-party distributors and not directly to end users, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major customers. In addition, we cannot assure that net sales from customers that have accounted for significant net sales in the past, either individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period.\nOur industry is experiencing significant scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future.\nOur medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA, DOJ, and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As a result, we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states and to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the federal level. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.\nMoreover, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), the SEC has implemented reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (specifically, tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to publicly report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals and whether we can determine if conflict minerals are used in products that we manufacture. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, if appropriate. In addition, the implementation of these rules could\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nadversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2015 calendar year, although we fully complied with the regulation, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.\nOur businesses are heavily reliant on certain raw materials and can be adversely impacted by rising prices.\nWe purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components and other supplies essential to our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and abroad. The principal raw materials that we use to conduct operations include chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components.\nFrom time to time we experience price increases for raw materials, with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers. During fiscal 2008, for example, we experienced unprecedented price increases in certain raw materials due in large part to the rising price of fuel and oil, including chemicals, paper and plastics (resins and bottles) which had a significant adverse impact on our gross margins. In addition, we experienced significant difficulty in obtaining certain chemicals in fiscal 2008 due to apparent shortages by certain suppliers. Although we do not currently foresee extraordinary difficulty in obtaining the materials, sub-assemblies, components or other supplies necessary for our business operations, we cannot predict if similar difficulties as those experienced in the past will occur again in the future, including further price increases, that may adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, although fuel and oil prices have been at relatively low levels, an increase in prices can also have a significant adverse impact on transportation costs related to both the purchasing and delivery of products and services. If costs materially increase in the future, we may not be able to implement price increases to our customers, which would adversely impact our gross margins.\nThe acquisition of new businesses and product lines, which has inherent risks, is an important part of our growth strategy.\nWe intend to grow, in part, by acquiring products and businesses. The success of this strategy depends upon several factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify and acquire appropriate products and businesses;\n\u00b7\nobtain financing for acquisitions on terms that are favorable or acceptable;\n\u00b7\nintegrate acquired operations, personnel, products, technologies and regulatory procedures into our organization effectively;\n\u00b7\nretain and motivate key personnel and retain the customers and suppliers of acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nrealize perceived synergies; and\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully promote and increase sales and profits of acquired product lines.\nEven if acceptable financing is obtained, such financing may result in charges associated with the potential write-off of existing deferred financing costs. We also may not be able to sustain the rates of growth that we have experienced in the past, whether by acquiring businesses or otherwise. In addition, we often experience competition from third parties interested in the same acquisition candidate. This may result in increases in the price paid for acquisition candidates.\nOther risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions include:\n\u00b7\ndelays in realizing the benefits of the transactions, including achievement of anticipated operating efficiencies and synergies and other transaction benefits as well as forecasted sales and earnings;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with the assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies.\nWe are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contingent future consideration, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The provisions of ASC 805 relating to contingent future consideration, or earn-outs, require us to record the fair value of such estimated amounts at the date of acquisition and continually remeasure the liability at each balance sheet date, which has the potential for creating significant earnings volatility.\nIn particular, on November 5, 2013 we recorded a $2,490,000 liability for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration and a $1,720,000 liability for the estimated fair value of an assumed contingent obligation payable to the Israeli Government relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition, as further described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These two liabilities are adjusted periodically by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Income driven by the time value of money and changes in the assumptions that were initially used in the valuations. The actual contingent consideration and assumed contingent obligation have the potential of being between zero and a percentage of unlimited sales that could occur until the completion of the seven year period with respect to the contingent consideration liability and until the assumed contingent obligation is satisfied in full, or until the sales of the Jet Prep Ltd. products no longer exist. The initial fair values of these two contingent liabilities of $2,490,000 and $1,720,000 decreased to zero and $1,138,000, respectively, at July 31, 2016 primarily due to commercialization delays, changes in probability factors and future sales projections based on recently completed market research, product modification plans and the passage of time. Such fair value amounts would have been higher or lower if we had used different probability factors, future sales projections or discount factors. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determinations of fair value, we may potentially have further earnings volatility in our future results of operations related to these Jet Prep obligations.\nFurthermore in connection with the acquisition of PuriCore, we acquired certain ordinary course business assets and liabilities, which included a contingent guaranteed obligation to reimburse an endoscope service company for endoscope repair costs it incurs when servicing its customers\u2019 endoscopes that are damaged by one of PuriCore\u2019s discontinued endoscope reprocessing machine models. Although the terms of the guarantee provide for no limit to the maximum potential future payments, we have estimated the present value of the liability on the date of the acquisition to be approximately $1,414,000. The determination of the fair value of this contingent guarantee obligation is subjective in nature and can be impacted by significant changes in third party service repair rates, the frequency of claims and a change in the expected life of these discontinued machines. This liability will be adjusted periodically by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Income driven by the time value of money and changes in the assumptions that were initially used in the valuation.\nGiven the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, we may potentially have significant earnings volatility in our future results of operations.\nIn addition, we have occasionally used our stock as partial consideration for acquisitions. Our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing stockholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. If future operating results of the acquired businesses are significantly less than the results anticipated at the time of the acquisitions, we may be required to incur impairment charges. However, the average fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts at July 31, 2016.\nAssumptions regarding the growth of businesses we acquire may differ from actual results.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nindemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur limited operating experience and market recognition in new international markets may limit our international expansion strategy and cause our international return on investments and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our international expansion efforts, including efforts in emerging markets such as China. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in locations and environments unfamiliar to us. Additionally, global operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including political and economic instability, general economic conditions, imposition of government controls, the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and United States export laws and trade restrictions. In connection with our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in North America, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, foreign customers\u2019 requirements and preferences, and the difficulty of administering business overseas. Further, sales practices in certain international markets may be inconsistent with our desired business practices and U.S. and other legal requirements, which may impact our ability to expand as planned. We may also encounter difficulty expanding in new international markets because of competitors already entrenched in the market, and our limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products in these new international markets. Our failure to develop new markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets may negatively affect our return on investments relating to our international expansion efforts.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results since we have a significant presence in the UK\nDuring fiscal 2016, we continued to invest significantly in infrastructure in China so that we can more readily import and sell our products. However, risks and uncertainties related to political and economic conditions in China, traditional business practices, foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development complications and intellectual property protection may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy in this market and, as a result, our sales growth and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected.\nFurther, international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs, and certain international markets may also be impacted by foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries, which could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to harmonize reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products.\nMost international jurisdictions have regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices may adopt such requirements; we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. In addition, the trend in countries around the world toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models, and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause us and other medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk, and expense. We expect that the international regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions, which may have a material impact on our business.\nFurther, any significant changes in the competitive, political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHealth care policy changes on both the federal and state levels may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, contains provisions that could have a material impact on our business. Among other provisions, this legislation imposes a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales. Late in 2015, Congress enacted legislation that suspended the excise tax for calendar years 2016 and 2017. During fiscals 2016 and 2015, our total excise tax incurred was $2,035,000 and $4,369,000, respectively, which decreased our gross profit by such amounts. Furthermore, we have been required to commit significant resources to \u201cSunshine Act\u201d compliance. In addition, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products and services.\nOur stock price and trading volume has been volatile from time to time and has experienced significant fluctuations over the past several months and years as a result of various market factors. We may experience continued fluctuations in price and volume in the future that could negatively impact the value of our outstanding shares.\nThe market for our common stock has, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated to our operating performance. Factors such as announcements of our quarterly financial results, new business developments and factors and events described in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, many of which are beyond our control, could cause the market price and trading volume of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. As a result, an investment in our stock could fluctuate significantly and/or decline in value.\nIn addition, the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry and other financial analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. We do not control these or any other analysts, nor do we control their respective reports. Our future operating results are subject to substantial uncertainty, and our stock price could decline significantly if we fail to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 forecasts and expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, lower their price target or issue commentary or observations about us or our stock that are perceived by the market as negative, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. In addition, there are many other large, well-established, publicly traded companies active in our industry and market, which may cause our company to garner less attention from industry analysts. If these analysts decrease coverage or otherwise cease to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nCompetition from lower cost manufacturing facilities such as those located in China, Southeast Asia and certain locations within North America could result in a reduction in our net sales of healthcare disposable products due to reduced average selling prices or our customers no longer purchasing certain products from us.\nDespite expensive shipping costs, quality concerns, sustainability issues and other matters, some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in lower cost locations such as China, Southeast Asia and certain locations within North America. Although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products, which are generally produced in the United States, are superior, our sales in the future may be adversely affected by either loss of sales or reductions in the prices of our products as a result of this lower cost competition. Price erosion resulting from lower cost competition did not have a material adverse impact on our business during fiscal year 2016, but no assurance can be given that we will not face increased competition in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which may delay or prevent new product introduction.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental and private agencies in both the United States and in other countries where we do business. In the United States, our products and services are regulated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In many foreign countries, sales of our products are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the FDA. In Europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the European Economic Area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities.\nThe regulatory agencies regulate the testing, manufacturing, recordkeeping, storage, packaging, labeling, marketing, distribution, marketing, reporting, safety and import and export of medical supplies and devices. Certain international regulatory bodies also impose import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. In general, unless an exemption applies, a medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. Delays in agency review can significantly delay new product introduction and may result in a product becoming \u201cdated\u201d or losing its market opportunity before it can be introduced. In addition, the FDA and other agency clearances generally are required before we can make significant modifications to existing products or market new claims or uses for existing products.\nThe FDA also has the authority to require a recall or modification of products in the event of a defect or other issues. The process of obtaining marketing clearances and approvals from regulatory agencies for new products (or modifications to, or additional claims or uses for, existing products) can be time consuming and expensive. There is no assurance that clearances or approvals will be granted or that agency review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nDuring the past several years, the FDA, in accordance with its standard practice, has conducted a number of inspections of our manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with regulatory standards relating to our testing, manufacturing, storage and packaging of products. On occasion, following an inspection, the FDA has called our attention to certain \u201cGood Manufacturing Practices\u201d compliance deficiencies.\nIf we fail to meet QSRs or violate applicable FDA, EPA or other laws or regulations or if any of our medical devices are found to be ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, or if we fail to adequately correct violations or comply with requests by regulatory agencies, we could be subject to reports or warning letters, citations and fines as well as additional regulatory action including an order to recall, replace, repair, or refund non-compliant medical devices. Further, regulatory agencies could detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The regulatory agencies may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The regulatory agencies may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ.\nFederal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that regulation of our products will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our business. For a more detailed discussion on government regulation and related risks, see \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results.\nOur operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We can give no assurance that our environmental, health and safety compliance programs have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nour reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. We cannot assure you that any liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our reputation or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nHealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our products are purchased by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services. Even if we offer a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S. and foreign countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nAt September 29, 2016, we had total outstanding borrowings of $171,000,000 under our existing credit facility that bore interest at rates that ranged from 2.02% to 2.83%. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are variable and substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are typically under LIBOR contracts. Therefore, our future results of operations may be adversely affected if LIBOR interest rates on our outstanding balance were to increase substantially, as more fully explained in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCurrency fluctuations and trade barriers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers, fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies, tariff increases and import and export restrictions, affecting all of such geographies including but not limited to the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Far East.\nChanges in the value of the Euro, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar and Chinese Renminbi against the United States dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts, accounts receivable and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in United States dollars, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars or Chinese Renminbi but must be converted into each entity\u2019s functional currency. Furthermore, the financial statements of our Italy, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChina subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the Euro, British Pound, Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi exchange rates relative to the United States dollar.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims resulting from the use of products we sell and distribute.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims resulting from the products we sell and distribute. We maintain product liability insurance, which we believe is adequate for our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage for these risks will continue to be available or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will continue to be available at a reasonable cost. A partially or completely uninsured successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe use chemicals and other regulated substances in the manufacturing of our products.\nIn the ordinary course of certain of our manufacturing processes, we use various chemicals and other regulated substances. Although we are not aware of any material claims involving violation of environmental or occupational health and safety laws or regulations, there can be no assurance that such a claim may not arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain our competitive position.\nWe rely heavily on proprietary technology that we protect primarily through licensing arrangements, patents, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. There can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents, regardless of whether we are an owner or a licensee of the patent, will not be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights will provide a competitive advantage to us. There can also be no assurance that our trade secrets or non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us or that our technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses, or other malicious codes, and cyber or phishing attacks. Although past attacks did not have a significant adverse impact on our business, these types of attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, or other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors and customers. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of future cyber incidents, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of key members of our management. Although none of our key executives has an employment agreement with the Company, each executive, including division CEOs, is party to a severance agreement with the Company. In addition, we have short and long term incentive plans for our key executives that are designed in part to have a retentive effect on the executives. However, there can be no assurance that the terms of the severance agreements or incentive plans will have such an effect. We believe the loss or unavailability of any such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, sales, marketing and other personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our businesses.", "PERMNO": 22825, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CMD"}
