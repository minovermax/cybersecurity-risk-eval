{"cik": "1669600", "company": "Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Expedia Holdings' Corporate History and Structure\nThe historical combined financial information of Expedia Holdings is not necessarily representative of Expedia Holdings\u2019 future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor does it reflect what Expedia Holdings\u2019 financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand-alone company during the periods presented.\nBecause the historical combined financial information of Expedia Holdings included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the results of our legacy business and because such financial information largely reflects the historical results of Vitalize, it is not representative of Expedia Holdings\u2019 future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor does it reflect what Expedia Holdings\u2019 financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand-alone company, pursuing independent strategies, during the periods presented, especially in light of the fact that the future results of operations will be significantly comprised of the results of Expedia.\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nIn connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, our bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cSplitSPV\u201d) entered into a margin loan arrangement in a principal amount of $400 million ($350 million of which was borrowed at the time of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, secured by all of our shares of EXPE, which are held through SplitSPV and which is guaranteed solely by us, with one or more third parties (the \u201cMargin Loan\u201d). Our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including to make debt service payments under SplitSPV's Margin Loan and any other credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly owned subsidiary Vitalize, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments (including Expedia) and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability\nI-16\nof our subsidiaries Vitalize and Expedia to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have direct access to the cash that Expedia generates from its operating activities.\nExpedia generated approximately $1,565 million, $1,368 million, and $1,367 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Expedia uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Expedia generates unless Expedia declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash (to the extent we were to participate in such repurchase) or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us.\nAlthough during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Expedia repurchased 4.0 million shares, 0.5 million shares and 7.0 million shares, respectively, spending $436 million, $45 million and $537 million, respectively, we have not participated in these stock repurchases. Further, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Expedia declared aggregate dividends of $1.00 per share, $0.84 per share and $0.66 per share, respectively. Although we have participated, pro rata, in these dividends, no assurance can be given that Expedia will continue to pay cash dividends at the same rate or at all.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nIn connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we have outstanding borrowings of $350 million under the Margin Loans. SplitSPV holds all of the shares of EXPE owned by our company. Because our most significant asset consists of our ownership interest in Expedia and the Margin Loans prohibit, with limited exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by SplitSPV, our company is very limited in its ability to incur additional financing, and our cash reserves and limited operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, the Margin Loans provide that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of EXPE falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loans will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest and, during approximately the first year of the term of the Margin Loans, a prepayment premium. If the Company or SplitSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged shares of EXPE that SplitSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures SplitSPV's obligations under the Margin Loans, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition as well as our access to capital on a going forward basis.\nWe have no operating history as a separate company upon which you can evaluate our performance.\nWe do not have an operating history as a separate public company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business will be successful on a long-term basis. We may not be able to grow our businesses as planned and may not be profitable.\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe that we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c40 Act\u201d). We were formed for the purpose of effecting the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and owning and holding our 52.3% voting interest in Expedia and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vitalize. We are primarily engaged in the global travel and online commerce industries through these companies. Our officers and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of the services agreement with Liberty Media devote their business activities with respect to us to the businesses of these companies. Our interests in Expedia and Vitalize comprise substantially all of our assets, and substantially all of our income, if any, is derived from dividends and other distributions made on our interests in Expedia and Vitalize. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act. If, at any time, we become primarily engaged, directly or through one or more of our subsidiaries, in a business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. Following any such change in our business and after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict our activities going forward. In\nI-17\naddition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nFactors Relating to Expedia Holdings\u2019 Businesses\nExpedia operates in an increasingly competitive global environment.\nThe market for the services that Expedia offers is increasingly and intensely competitive. Expedia competes with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel-related services, including:\n\u00b7\nonline and traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators;\n\u00b7\ntravel suppliers, including hotels and airlines;\n\u00b7\nlarge online portal and search websites;\n\u00b7\ntravel metasearch websites;\n\u00b7\ncorporate travel management service providers;\n\u00b7\nmobile platform travel applications;\n\u00b7\nsocial media websites;\n\u00b7\necommerce websites and group buying websites; and\n\u00b7\nalternative accommodation websites.\nOnline and traditional travel agencies: Expedia faces increasing competition from other online travel agencies (\u201cOTAs\u201d) in many regions, such as The Priceline Group and its subsidiaries Booking.com and Agoda.com, as well as regional competitors such as Ctrip, which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers, including pricing and supply breadth. In addition, the global OTA market continues to consolidate, with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships. Expedia also competes with traditional travel agencies (operating both offline and online), wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply.\nTravel suppliers: Travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them, including lower prices, no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs, such as points and miles. Many of these competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of third-party distributors such as the various Expedia sites. For instance, some low cost airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications. In the past, certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites. Suppliers who sell on their own websites, in some instances, offer advantages such as favorable rates, increased or exclusive product availability, complimentary Wi-Fi, and their own bonus miles or loyalty points, or in the case of airlines, promote hotel supply at their websites, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than Expedia's.\nSearch engines: Expedia also faces increasing competition from search engines including Google. To the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in Expedia's key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning, shopping or booking capabilities, or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners, increase the cost of traffic directed to Expedia's websites, or offer the ability to transact on their own website, there could be a material adverse impact on Expedia's business and financial performance. For example, in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities, comparable to OTAs. In addition, these search engines continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on Expedia's search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic, Expedia's business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nI-18\nIn addition, Expedia's websites, or websites in which Expedia holds a significant ownership position, including trivago-branded websites, compete for advertising revenue with these search engines, as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travel-related companies. Several of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger client bases than Expedia. Expedia expects to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market. Competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs, reduced margins on Expedia's advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to Expedia's websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on Expedia's websites.\nTravel metasearch engines: Travel metasearch websites, including Kayak.com (a subsidiary of Priceline), trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of Expedia), TripAdvisor, Inc. (\u201cTripAdvisor\u201d) and Qunar (a subsidiary of Ctrip), aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites. In addition, some metasearch sites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of Expedia's brands. To the extent metasearch websites limit Expedia's participation within their search results, or consumers utilize the metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of Expedia, Expedia's traffic-generating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner, or it may be required to increase its marketing costs to maintain market share, either of which could have an adverse effect on Expedia's business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of Expedia's acquisition of a majority ownership interest in trivago, Expedia also now competes more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue. To the extent that trivago's ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites is hampered, whether due to its affiliation with Expedia or otherwise, trivago's business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of Expedia's investment in trivago could be negatively impacted.\nCorporate travel management service providers: Egencia, Expedia's full-service corporate travel management company, competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers, including Carlson Wagonlit and American Express, as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services, including Concur. Some of these competitors may have more financial resources, greater name recognition, well-established client bases, differentiated business models, or a broader global presence, which may make it difficult for Expedia to retain or attract new corporate travel clients.\nMobile platform travel applications: Mobile platforms, including smartphones and tablet computers, continue to grow significantly. The improved functionality of mobile platforms has led to an increased use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel. If Expedia is unable to offer innovative, user-friendly, feature-rich mobile applications and websites for its travel services, along with effective marketing and advertising, or if its mobile applications and websites are not used by consumers, Expedia could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and its future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSocial media websites: Social media websites, including Facebook, continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications, which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers, resulting in additional competition. Notably, Facebook has launched Dynamic Ads for Travel product, expanding its reach into the travel market.\nAlternative accommodations: Airbnb and similar websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and vacation rental properties available through Expedia websites, including HomeAway. The continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for Expedia's services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and vacation rentals. Furthermore, Airbnb and similar websites have added other travel services, such as tours, activities, hotel and flight bookings, any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional OTAs.\nOther participants in the travel industry: Traditional consumer ecommerce websites and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites. To the extent such websites continue to expand these services over time, it may create additional competition. In addition, car rideshare services, such as Uber, increasingly compete with the traditional car rental services that Expedia offers on its retail websites and to its corporate clients, which may negatively affect its car-based and corporate travel businesses.\nI-19\nWe cannot assure you that Expedia will be able to compete successfully against any current, emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge, or provide differentiated products and services to its traveler base. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may force Expedia to make changes to its business models, which could affect its financial performance and liquidity. In general, increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand recognition.\nThe industry in which Expedia operates is dynamic.\nExpedia continues to adapt its business to remain competitive, including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile, as well as offering new consumer choices, including inventory types and transactional models, and increasing supplier inventory on its existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships. If Expedia fails to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments, its business could be adversely affected. Expedia's attempts to adapt its current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives, different legal or tax requirements, inadequate return on investments, difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto Expedia's platforms, as well as limit its ability to develop new site features. In addition, adaptations to Expedia's business may require significant investments, including changes to its financial systems and processes, which could significantly increase its costs and increase the risk of payment delays and/or non-payments of amounts owed to it from its supplier partners and customers. In addition, these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm Expedia's financial condition and operating results.\nExpedia's business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other traffic-generating arrangements.\nExpedia increasingly utilizes internet search engines such as Google, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate a significant portion of the traffic to its websites and the websites of its affiliates. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user's search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to Expedia's websites and those of its affiliates can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to Expedia's websites and those of its affiliates through participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on search engines, including Google, and travel metasearch engines, including Kayak and TripAdvisor. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly, both technically and competitively. Moreover, a search or metasearch engine could, for competitive or other purposes, adopt emerging technologies, such as voice, alter its search algorithms or results, any of which could cause a website to place lower in search query results, or inhibit participation in the search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of Expedia's websites and the websites of its affiliates, or those of its third-party distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine marketing or other traffic-generating arrangements in a negative manner, Expedia's business and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. In addition, certain metasearch companies have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites. To the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings, this may reduce the amount of traffic to Expedia's websites or those of its affiliates.\nExpedia's business depends on its relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners.\nAn important component of Expedia's business success depends on its ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners, as well as owners and managers of vacation rental properties. A substantial portion of Expedia's revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers, in particular hotel suppliers, airlines, and GDS partners for bookings made through its websites. Each year Expedia typically negotiates or renegotiates numerous long-term hotel and airline contracts.\nNo assurances can be given that Expedia's compensation, access to inventory, or access to inventory at competitive rates, will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future, or that travel suppliers will not reduce average daily rates (\u201cADRs\u201d), attempt to implement costly direct connections, charge Expedia for or otherwise restrict access to content, increase credit card fees or fees for other services, fail to provide Expedia with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase Expedia's operating expenses. Any of these actions, or other similar actions, could reduce Expedia's revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting its business and financial performance.\nI-20\nDeclines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect Expedia\u2019s business and financial performance.\nExpedia\u2019s business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry. Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business-related discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns. Decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for Expedia\u2019s services, thereby causing a reduction in revenue.\nFor example, during regional or global recessions, domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers, which slow spending on the services Expedia provides and have a negative impact on its revenue growth. Additionally, if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions, and/or significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, it can lead to a negative impact on Expedia\u2019s foreign denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on Expedia\u2019s services by both business and leisure travelers, which may have a material adverse impact on its business and financial performance. Political instability, including as a result of the recent United Kingdom \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum to withdraw from the European Union, geopolitical conflicts, significant fluctuations in currency values, sovereign debt issues, and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment, which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. For example, the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015 had a negative impact in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nExpedia\u2019s business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and ADRs, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices, or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which Expedia has experienced historically.\nOther factors that could negatively affect Expedia\u2019s business include:\n\u00b7\nSignificant changes in oil prices;\n\u00b7\nContinued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation;\n\u00b7\nReduced access to discount airfares;\n\u00b7\nTravel-related strikes or labor unrest, bankruptcies or liquidations;\n\u00b7\nIncreased incidents of actual or threatened terrorism;\n\u00b7\nPeriods of political instability or geopolitical conflict, resulting in additional restrictions on travel or travelers becoming concerned about safety issues;\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters or events such as severe weather conditions, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes or earthquakes;\n\u00b7\nTravel-related accidents or the grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns; and\n\u00b7\nHealth-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.\nSuch concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for Expedia\u2019s travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect Expedia\u2019s business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease Expedia\u2019s revenues leading to constrained liquidity if Expedia, as it has done historically in the case of severe weather conditions, provides relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services.\nExpedia and Vitalize rely on the value of their brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing brand awareness are increasing.\nExpedia and Vitalize invest considerable financial and human resources in their respective brands in order to retain and expand their customer bases. We expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing these brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including increased spending from competitors, promotional and discounting activities, the increasing costs of growing customer loyalty programs, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among these multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where their brands are less\nI-21\nwell known, inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative travel-related traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines. During 2016, certain online travel companies and metasearch sites continued to expand their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally, increasing competition for share of voice, and Expedia expects this activity to continue in the future. Expedia is also pursuing and expects to continue to pursue long-term growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets, which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on its overall marketing efficiency. Vitalize's ability to maintain and enhance its brands will depend largely on its ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy and innovative products, which it may not be able to do successfully. Vitalize may also introduce new products, terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect its brand.\nExpedia's and Vitalize's efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of their brands may not be successful, and, even if they are successful in their branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective, or as efficient as they have been historically. Moreover, branding efforts with respect to some brands within the Expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within its portfolio. In addition, decisions over allocation of resources, and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in Expedia\u2019s or Vitalize\u2019s respective portfolios at the expense of not investing in, or reducing their investments in, other brands in their respective portfolios could have an overall negative financial impact. If Expedia and Vitalize are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of their brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on their businesses and financial performance.\nExpedia and Vitalize rely on information technology to operate their businesses and maintain their competitiveness, and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm their businesses.\nExpedia depends on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications, reservations, customer service, supplier connectivity, communications, procurement, payments, fraud detection and administration, while Vitalize relies extensively on information systems for its ecommerce business (which includes website, mobile applications, customer service, payment and fraud detection), supply chain, manufacturing operations, financial reporting, human resources and various other processes and transactions. As Expedia's and Vitalize\u2019s operations grow in size, scope and complexity, they must continuously improve and upgrade their systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of their systems and infrastructure.\nExpedia's and Vitalize's future success also depends on their ability to adapt their services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of their services in response to competitive service and product offerings. The emergence of cloud computing, the growth of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms have, and will continue to, require new and costly investments in technology. Transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services Expedia and Vitalize provide, and may increase their reliance on third party service providers. For example, Expedia is beginning to ramp up a multi-year project to migrate products and functionality and significantly increase its utilization of cloud computing services (such as Amazon Web Services). In addition, Expedia and Vitalize may not be successful, or may be less successful than their current or new competitors, in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers, either of which would negatively impact their businesses and financial performance. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing and software as a service provider, could also make it easier for competition to enter Expedia's markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, Expedia and Vitalize may not be able to maintain their existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as they would like or in a cost-effective manner.\nExpedia has been engaged in a multi-year effort to migrate key portions of its consumer, affiliate, and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable it to improve conversion, innovate more rapidly, achieve better search engine optimization and improve its site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities, among other anticipated benefits. Vitalize also continually adds software and hardware, effectively upgrading its systems and network infrastructure, as well as taking other steps to improve the efficiency of its systems. Implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past, and may continue to be in the future, more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated, and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Expedia's and Vitalize's ability to develop new site features. In addition, during Expedia\u2019s migration process the sites have in the past, and may continue in the future, to experience reduced\nI-22\nfunctionality, decreases in conversion rates, and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems. Also, Expedia and Vitalize may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems, or enhancements to existing infrastructure, technologies and systems, in the future. Overall, these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. If any of these events occur, Expedia's and Vitalize's respective businesses and financial performance could suffer.\nAcquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nExpedia has acquired, invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past, and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on Expedia's business are:\n\u00b7\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from Expedia\u2019s existing businesses; for example, during 2016, Expedia expended significant resources in the integration of Orbitz and the initial public offering of trivago;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nUse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions, including with regard to future payment obligations in connection with put/call rights, may limit other potential uses of Expedia's cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nAmortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences, including changes in fair value of contingent consideration;\n\u00b7\nExpected and unexpected costs incurred in pursuing acquisitions, including identifying and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful, if unsuccessful could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on Expedia's business, operating results or financial condition;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, vendors and affiliates of Expedia's business and the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nThe assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nFailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated traffic, transactions, revenues, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;\n\u00b7\nFailure to generate adequate returns on Expedia's acquisitions and investments, or returns in excess of alternative uses of capital;\n\u00b7\nFailure to properly and timely integrate acquired companies and their operations, reducing Expedia's ability to achieve, among other things, anticipated returns on its acquisitions through cost savings and other synergies;\n\u00b7\nEntrance into markets in which Expedia has no direct prior experience and increased complexity in its business;\n\u00b7\nChallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts, that may arise in the context of a joint venture or majority ownership investment;\n\u00b7\nImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from Expedia's acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nCosts associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nIncreased or unexpected costs or delays to obtain governmental approvals for acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nIncreased competition amongst potential acquirers for acquisition targets could result in a material increase in the purchase price for such targets or otherwise limit Expedia's ability to consummate acquisitions; and\n\u00b7\nAdverse market reaction to acquisitions or investments or failure to consummate such transactions.\nI-23\nMoreover, Expedia relies heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to it by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. Expedia's failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause it to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm its business generally.\nExpedia\u2019s HomeAway business is in the process of transitioning to a primarily transaction-based business, which could have a material adverse effect on Expedia\u2019s operations and financial results.\nExpedia is subject to legal, financial and competitive risk associated with HomeAway\u2019s transition to a primarily transaction-based business. HomeAway historically generated the majority of its revenues when owners or managers of vacation rentals paid HomeAway subscription fees for the listing of their properties on the HomeAway family of sites. While subscription fees were the predominant source of revenue for HomeAway, a growing share of HomeAway\u2019s revenue is now generated from a commission-based business model, where the traveler pays a service fee for the use of the HomeAway platform and the owner or manager of the property pays HomeAway a fee or a commission on a transactional basis for each booking of the property by a traveler. HomeAway launched the traveler service fee and introduced its Book with Confidence Guarantee in the United States beginning in February 2016, followed by a rollout in Europe beginning in June 2016. In addition, HomeAway moved to a single subscription option for its homeowners and property manager partners in July 2016. HomeAway\u2019s business model transition involves significant additional risks and potential costs for HomeAway, including:\n\u00b7\nDelays or unanticipated costs in implementing the transition, which may delay or negate any expected benefits;\n\u00b7\nSupplier or traveler disruption similar to or worse than disruptions associated with previous business model and platform migrations;\n\u00b7\nMarket research that indicated higher than expected price elasticity for travelers in increasingly transparent markets such as HomeAway's market and for HomeAway's suppliers more broadly;\n\u00b7\nSuppliers and travelers may not adopt HomeAway's new payment structures as expected or at all, or may choose to transact with competitors;\n\u00b7\nExecution risk associated with launching a new business initiative that HomeAway did not have prior experience in;\n\u00b7\nFailure to implement or expand HomeAway's technology, systems and network infrastructure in light of additional payment processing and reporting complexity, or failure to do so at reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nHigher cost of traffic reducing cost per view effectiveness and reducing HomeAway's ability to spend at the desired return on investment;\n\u00b7\nIncreased risk of fraud; and\n\u00b7\nAdditional potential tax exposures.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on HomeAway's business and results of operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Expedia's operations and financial results.\nIn addition, HomeAway has been and continues to be, subject to regulatory development that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so, and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations. Some states and local jurisdictions also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to vacation rentals. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals. In addition, many of the fundamental statutes and ordinances that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm Expedia\u2019s business.\nI-24\nExpedia's and Vitalize's international operations involve additional risks and their exposure to these risks will increase as their businesses expand globally.\nExpedia operates in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intends to continue to expand its international presence. As Expedia has expanded globally, its international (non-U.S.) revenue has increased from 39% in 2010 to 43% in 2016. In foreign jurisdictions, Expedia faces complex, dynamic and varied risk landscapes. As Expedia begins to operate in new markets and countries, it must tailor its services and business models to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets, which can be complex, difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or Expedia's failure to adapt its practices, systems, processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which it expands, could slow its growth. For example, to compete in certain international markets Expedia has in the past, and may in the future, adopt locally-preferred payment methods, which has increased its costs and instances of fraud. Certain international markets in which Expedia operates have lower margins than more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on its overall margins as its revenues from these markets grow over time.\nAs Expedia continues to grow its global presence, it accumulates a greater portion of its cash balances outside of the United States in its foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of cash balances by Expedia\u2019s foreign subsidiaries to the United States may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments.\nIn addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section, Expedia's and Vitalize's international operations are also subject to a number of other risks, including:\n\u00b7\nCurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations, and the risks and costs inherent in hedging such exposures;\n\u00b7\nExposure to local economic or political instability and threatened or actual acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption, antitrust or competition, economic sanctions, data content and privacy, consumer protection, employment and labor laws, health and safety, and advertising and promotions;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally;\n\u00b7\nDifferences, inconsistent interpretations and changes in U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including international and local tax laws and regulations, tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nWeaker enforcement of Expedia's and Vitalize's contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nLower levels of credit card usage and increased payment and fraud risk;\n\u00b7\nLonger payment cycles, and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nPreferences by local populations for local providers;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on, or adverse tax and other consequences related to, repatriation of cash, the withdrawal of non-U.S. investments, cash balances and earnings, as well as restrictions on the ability to invest in operations in certain countries;\n\u00b7\nFinancial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies;\n\u00b7\nSlower adoption of the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7\nLimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nInconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u00b7\nExpedia's and Vitalize's ability to support new technologies, including mobile devices, that may be more prevalent in international markets;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees in international markets, as well as managing staffing and operations due to increased complexity, distance, time zones, language and cultural differences; and\nI-25\n\u00b7\nUncertainty regarding liability for products, services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent.\nThe China travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years. Prior to May 2015, Expedia conducted its operations in China primarily through its majority ownership interest in eLong, a leading online travel service provider in China. Following the sale of its eLong ownership stake in May 2015 to a group of China-based purchasers, including to a subsidiary of Ctrip, Expedia has conducted its business in China through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners, including Ctrip. There can be no guarantee that Expedia will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in China and its failure to do so could significantly impact its ability to grow its overall business.\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect Expedia's and Vitalize's businesses, financial performance, results of operations or business growth.\nExpedia's and Vitalize's businesses and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to Expedia and Vitalize and their businesses, including those relating to travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements, the sale and advertising of substances regulated by the FDA and other government agencies, the internet and online commerce, internet advertising and price display, consumer protection, anti-corruption, anti-trust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, tax, banking, data activities or otherwise penalize Expedia or Vitalize if its practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements. Unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for Expedia's and Vitalize 's products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, affect their margins, increase costs and/or subject them to additional liabilities.\nFor example, there are, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet, display of certain taxes and fees, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.\nLikewise, the SEC, Department of Justice and Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d), as well as foreign regulatory authorities, have continued to increase the enforcement of economic and trade regulations and anti-corruption laws across industries. U.S. trade sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and the Crimea regions of the Ukraine, and nationals and others of those countries, as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities. Expedia and Vitalize believe that their respective activities comply with OFAC, European Union and United Kingdom economic sanction and trade regulations and anti-corruption regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. As regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, Expedia and Vitalize cannot guarantee that their respective programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event their controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, they could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal money penalties, litigation and damage to their reputation and the value of their brands.\nExpedia also has been subject, and it will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations, including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and, in particular, parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies. The failure of Expedia's businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against it by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, Expedia's compliance with such laws may put it at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements. Expedia is unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits, and their impact, if any, on its business and results of operations.\nI-26\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which Expedia provides travel services could require it to change certain aspects of its business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities.\nFrom time to time, Congress, the FDA, the FTC or other federal, state, local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to Vitalize, repeal laws or regulations that Vitalize considers favorable to it or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. Such developments could require formulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling and advertising, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting or other new requirements.\nFurthermore, Expedia's and Vitalize's future growth may be limited by anti-trust or competition laws. For example, Expedia's business has grown and continues to expand, and, as a consequence, increases in its size and market share may negatively affect its ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could adversely affect Expedia's ability to grow and compete.\nApplication of existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities.\nThe application of various domestic and international income and non-income tax laws, rules and regulations to Expedia's historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities. These taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation and/or enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations over time, as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues. This has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities. As such, additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of Expedia's current tax reserves or may require Expedia to modify its business practices to reduce its exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA number of taxing authorities have made inquiries, filed lawsuits and levied assessments asserting that Expedia is required to collect and remit hotel occupancy, state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes. Expedia is also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of value added tax to its European Union transactions, as well as in multiple jurisdictions globally. While Expedia believes it complies with applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, tax authorities may conclude that it owes additional taxes. Expedia has in the past and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity, which payments may be substantial. This requirement is commonly referred to as \"pay-to-play.\" Payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes. For example, as a pre-condition to challenging the assessments, in 2015, Expedia paid $2.3 million under protest to the city of Portland, Oregon and Multnomah County, Oregon; during 2009, Expedia paid $48 million under protest to the city of San Francisco and an additional $25.5 million under protest on May 26, 2014 in connection with additional assessments; and during 2013, Expedia paid $171 million to the state of Hawaii. In September 2015, following a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court the State of Hawaii refunded the Expedia companies $132 million of the original \u201cpay-to-play\u201d amount, and Orbitz also received a similar refund of $22 million. The Expedia companies intend to appeal the August 5, 2016 decision by the Hawaii tax court holding that taxes are due on the online travel companies\u2019 services to facilitate merchant model car rental transactions, in which case the Expedia companies will be expected to pay under protest the full amount claimed due, or approximately $16.5 million, as a condition of appeal.\nSignificant judgment and estimation is required in determining Expedia's worldwide tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of Expedia's business, there are transactions and calculations, including intercompany transactions and cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. Tax authorities may disagree with Expedia's intercompany charges, including the amount of or basis for such charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. Expedia believes its tax estimates are reasonable, however, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from its historical income tax provisions and accruals in which case it may be subject to additional tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nI-27\nSystem interruptions, security breaches and the lack of redundancy in Expedia's and Vitalize's respective information systems may harm their businesses.\nExpedia and Vitalize rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including booking and purchase transactions, intellectual property, proprietary business information and that of its suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, and data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, Expedia relies on its information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Vitalize relies extensively on information systems for its ecommerce business, supply chain, manufacturing operations, financial reporting, human resources and various other processes and transactions.\nThe risk of a cybersecurity-related attack, intrusion, or disruption, including by criminal organizations, hacktivists, foreign governments, and terrorists, is persistent. Additionally, as Expedia continues to integrate its acquired companies, such as Orbitz, into its information technology systems, it may increase the risk of these system interruptions. Expedia and Vitalize have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. These interruptions could include security intrusions, attacks on systems for fraud or service interruption, computer and telecommunications failures and natural events. Significant interruptions, outages or delays in their internal systems, or systems of third parties that they rely upon - including multiple co-location providers for data centers, cloud computing providers for application hosting, and network access providers - and network access, or deterioration in the performance of such systems, would impair their ability to process transactions, decrease the quality of service that they can offer to customers, damage their reputation and brands, increase their costs and/or cause losses.\nPotential security breaches to Expedia's or Vitalize's systems or the systems of their service providers, whether resulting from internal or external sources, could significantly harm their respective businesses. Both Expedia and Vitalize devote resources to network security, monitoring and testing, employee training and other security measures, but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent Expedia's or Vitalize's security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information, intellectual property, proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in their operations. Expedia and Vitalize may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, and a security breach resulting in the reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently, are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, Expedia and Vitalize may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties. Security breaches could also cause customers and potential users of Expedia and Vitalize and their respective business partners to lose confidence in their security, which would have a negative effect on the value of their brands. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for Expedia's or Vitalize's own systems or systems of vendors, could expose them to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Expedia's or Vitalize's backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of their operations or business processes in all circumstances, many other systems are not fully redundant and their disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. Although Expedia and Vitalize have put measures in place to protect certain portions of their respective facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent Expedia or Vitalize from providing services to their customers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. In addition, remediation efforts may be costly and Expedia and Vitalize may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.\nI-28\nAmendments to existing tax laws, rules or regulations or enactment of new unfavorable tax laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on Expedia's and Vitalize's businesses and financial performance.\nMany of the underlying laws, rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy. If the tax laws, rules or regulations were amended, or if new unfavorable laws, rules or regulations were enacted, particularly with respect to occupancy, sales, value-added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d), or unclaimed property, or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy, the results could increase Expedia's and Vitalize's tax payments or other obligations, prospectively or retrospectively, subject them to interest and penalties, decrease the demand for their products and services if they pass on such costs to their consumers, result in increased costs to update or expand their technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of their business activities if they decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions. As a result, these changes could have an adverse effect on Expedia's and Vitalize\u2019s businesses or financial performance.\nTaxing authorities may also successfully assert that Vitalize should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, commercial activity, VAT or similar taxes, and it could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales. Vitalize does not collect sales and use, commercial activity, VAT or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which it has sales, based on its belief that such taxes are not applicable. Several states have presented Vitalize with tax assessments, alleging that it is required to collect and remit sales and other similar taxes. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements could have an adverse effect on Vitalize's business or financial performance.\nIn addition, in the past U.S. and foreign governments have introduced proposals for tax legislation, or have adopted tax laws, that could have a significant adverse effect on Expedia's and Vitalize's tax rates, or increase their tax liabilities, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or their deferred tax liabilities. For example, in October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multi-jurisdictional approach to \"base erosion and profit shifting\" by multinational companies. Multiple member jurisdictions, including the countries in which Expedia and Vitalize operate, have begun implementing recommended changes such as country by country reporting (\u201cCBCR\u201d). The CBCR standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies. The CBCR disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity. Additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years. Certain countries have adopted unilateral changes increasing the risk of double taxation. Any changes to U.S. or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of Expedia's and Vitalize's foreign earnings and adversely affect their profitability. Expedia's and Vitalize's effective tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to their operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions.\nExpedia and Vitalize continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify their obligations under existing, new and emerging tax laws and regulations.\nExpedia and Vitalize are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could adversely affect their businesses and financial condition.\nExpedia is involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes, property, personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, antitrust, consumer protection, securities laws, and other claims. Vitalize may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims initiated by others, other competitors or entities may assert rights in, or ownership of, its trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in marks that are similar to Vitalize's, and it may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to its satisfaction. These matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to Expedia's or Vitalize's businesses or operations. The defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect Expedia's or Vitalize's businesses, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period.\nI-29\nExpedia and Vitalize are subject to payments-related and fraud risks.\nExpedia has agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions, the volume of which are very large and continue to grow, for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from Expedia's travel suppliers. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of Expedia's cash (a \u201choldback\u201d) or require Expedia to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company. These processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in Expedia's financial condition. An imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of Expedia's processing companies could materially reduce Expedia's liquidity. Moreover, there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or fees Expedia and Vitalize pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce Expedia's and Vitalize's revenue, thereby adversely affecting their businesses and financial performance.\nIn addition, credit card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d). Under these rules, Expedia and Vitalize are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of card data. Expedia and Vitalize assess their compliance with the PCI DSS rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to their internal controls. Failure to comply may subject Expedia and Vitalize to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability and could prevent them from processing or accepting credit cards.\nExpedia's and Vitalize's results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by their acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points. Expedia and Vitalize are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent orders on their websites or other orders for which payment is subsequently disputed by their customers, both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by Expedia or Vitalize, as applicable, for such orders (a \u201ccharge back\u201d). Accordingly, Expedia and Vitalize calculate and record allowances for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs. Expedia's and Vitalize's abilities to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including smartphones and tablet computers, and global expansion, including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. In addition, for existing and future payment options Expedia and Vitalize offers to its respective customers, they may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of their payments products), as well as fraud. If Expedia and Vitalize are unable to effectively combat fraudulent orders on their websites or mobile applications or if they otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs, Expedia's and Vitalize's respective results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, when onboarding suppliers to Expedia's websites, Expedia may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials, which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of its websites and mobile applications. A fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity, damage to Expedia's reputation, and could cause users of its websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of its services. Any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of Expedia's brands, which could have an adverse impact on its financial performance.\nExpedia has foreign exchange risk.\nExpedia conducts a significant and growing portion of its business outside the United States. As a result, it faces exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the British pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht, Brazilian real, and Nordic currencies.\nThese exposures include but are not limited to re-measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay; planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time Expedia prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur; and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border travel such as from Europe to the United States and the United States to Europe.\nI-30\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if Expedia chooses not to hedge or fails to hedge effectively its exposure, it could experience a material adverse effect on its financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase, and the impact on Expedia's results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of Expedia's business have made hedging these exposures more complex. Expedia has increased and plans to continue increasing the scope, complexity and duration of its foreign exchange risk management. Expedia makes a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies. In addition, an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems, accurate and reliable data sources, controls and change management procedures. In the event Expedia's estimates differ significantly from actual results or if it fails to adopt effective hedging processes, Expedia could experience greater volatility as a result of its hedging activities.\nExpedia's stock price is highly volatile.\nThe market price of Expedia's common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond its control:\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in its operating and financial results;\n\u00b7\nOperating and financial results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, including failure to deliver returns on technology or emerging market marketing investments;\n\u00b7\nChanges in expectations as to Expedia's future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nRating agency credit rating actions or pronouncements;\n\u00b7\nReaction to Expedia's earnings releases and conference calls, or presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences;\n\u00b7\nWorldwide macro-economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nChanges in Expedia's capital or governance structure;\n\u00b7\nChanges in market valuations of other internet or online service companies;\n\u00b7\nChanges in search industry dynamics, such as key word pricing and traffic, or other changes that negatively affect Expedia's ability to generate traffic to its websites;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of dividends or changes in the amount or frequency of Expedia's dividends;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of technological innovations or new services by Expedia or its competitors;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by Expedia or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nLoss of a major travel supplier, such as an airline, hotel or car rental chain;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the status of Expedia's intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nLack of success in the expansion of Expedia's business model geographically;\n\u00b7\nSignificant claims or proceedings against Expedia or adverse developments or decisions in pending proceedings;\n\u00b7\nSignificant security breaches;\n\u00b7\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nRumors or public speculation about any of the above factors; and\n\u00b7\nPrice and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.\nVolatility in Expedia's stock price could also make it less attractive to certain investors, and/or invite speculative trading in its common stock or debt instruments.\nI-31\nExpedia may experience constraints in its liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable, either of which could harm its financial position.\nDue to its increasing international presence, Expedia may continue to accumulate a greater portion of its cash flows in certain foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the United States, including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or debt refinancings, would likely result in additional U.S. income tax expense. In addition, Expedia has experienced, and may experience in the future, declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by its merchant hotel business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion of its operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of Expedia's merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital, such as its agency hotel, advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers. Expedia also continued to see growth in both its merchant (Expedia Collect) and agency (Hotel Collect) hotel products. To the extent its merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline, it would likely result in pressure on Expedia's working capital cash balances, cash flow over time and liquidity.\nThe availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which Expedia exerts no control. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, Expedia can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that its counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. In addition, any downgrade of Expedia's debt ratings by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch or similar ratings agencies, increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase its cost of capital.\nExpedia and Vitalize process, store and use personal information, payment card information and other consumer data, which subjects them to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations.\nExpedia and Vitalize may acquire personal or confidential information from users of their websites and mobile applications. There are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, payment card information and other consumer data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. Expedia and Vitalize strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. It is possible, however, that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies. Any failure or perceived failure by Expedia, Vitalize or their service providers to comply with the privacy policies, privacy related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information, payment card information or other consumer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements by consumer advocacy groups or others against Expedia or Vitalize, as applicable, and could cause Expedia's and Vitalize's customers and members to lose trust in them, as well as subject them to bank fines, penalties or increased transaction costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. In addition, the new data transfer network between the EU and U.S. and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield, may result in a greater compliance burden for companies, including Expedia, with users in Europe and increased costs of compliance. The European Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, effective in May 2018, which establishes new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. Further on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as \u201ccookies.\u201d Finally, countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing\nI-32\nnew privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted.\nExpedia relies on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if it is unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, its business would be harmed.\nExpedia's performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Expedia's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of its organization. In particular, the contributions of Mr. Diller, Expedia's Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, its Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management of the company. Expedia's future success will depend on the performance of its senior management and key employees. Expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of its senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could seriously harm its business. Competition for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of Expedia's business, including software engineers, developers, product management personnel, development personnel, and other technology professionals, also remains intense.\nExpedia's continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. For example, additional barriers to or restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes, such as those in the United States in early 2017, may cause significant disruption to Expedia\u2019s businesses or negatively affect its ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis. If Expedia does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected. Expedia does not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nExpedia has in the past, and may again in the future, restructure portions of its global workforce to simplify and streamline its organization, improve its cost structure and strengthen its overall businesses. These changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to Expedia's business and financial performance.\nActual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the management and directors of IAC/InterActiveCorp, on the other.\nMr. Diller serves as Expedia's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp (\u201cIAC\u201d), and Mr. Victor Kaufman serves as Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that Mr. Diller and Mr. Kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both IAC and Expedia. They may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies.\nExpedia's certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia.\nExpedia and Vitalize work closely with various business partners and rely on third-parties for many systems and services, and therefore could be harmed by their activities.\nExpedia and Vitalize could be harmed by the activities of third parties that they do not control. Expedia and Vitalize work closely with business partners, including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures, and, in the case of Expedia, through its Expedia Affiliate Network business. Expedia and Vitalize also rely on third-party service providers for certain customer care, fulfillment, processing, systems development, technology and other services, including, increasingly, travel care (in the case of Expedia) and information technology services. If these partners or third-party service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet Expedia's or Vitalize\u2019s respective requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities, it could damage Expedia's and Vitalize's respective reputations, make it difficult for them to operate some aspects of their respective businesses, or expose Expedia and Vitalize to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on Expedia's and Vitalize's respective businesses and financial\nI-33\nperformance. Likewise, if the third-party service providers on which Expedia and Vitalize rely were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, Expedia and Vitalize could suffer increased costs and delays in their ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or Expedia and Vitalize could develop replacement technology or operations, any of which could also have an adverse impact on Expedia's and Vitalize's respective business and financial performance.\nExpedia is exposed to various counterparty risks.\nExpedia is exposed to the risk that various counterparties, including financial entities, will fail to perform. This creates risk in a number of areas, including with respect to Expedia's bank deposits and investments, foreign exchange risk management, insurance coverages, and letters of credit. As it relates to deposits, as of December 31, 2016, Expedia held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately $1.3 billion (primarily in Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase) and held time deposits of approximately $324 million at financial institutions including BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase, Mizuho Bank Ltd. (\u201cMizuho\u201d), National Australia Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank. Additionally, majority-owned subsidiaries of Expedia held cash of approximately $313 million (primarily in Deutsche Bank and National Australia Bank). As it relates to foreign exchange, as of December 31, 2016, Expedia was party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately $1.9 billion, the fair value of which was a liability of approximately $4 million. The counterparties to these contracts were Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Citibank, Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Mizuho, Royal Bank of Canada, Standard Chartered Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Societe Generale, and Wells Fargo. Expedia employs forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts, the counterparties are obligated, or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts, to return Expedia's funds or pay Expedia net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to liquidate, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts.\nIn addition, due to instability in the economy Expedia also faces increased credit risk and payment delays from its non-financial contract counterparties.\nExpedia has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition\nExpedia has outstanding long-term indebtedness with a face value of $3.2 billion, and it has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Risks relating to Expedia's indebtedness include:\n\u00b7\nincreasing Expedia's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequiring Expedia to dedicate a portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nmaking it difficult for Expedia to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u00b7\nlimiting Expedia's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u00b7\nplacing Expedia at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting Expedia's ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that Expedia finds acceptable.\nThe agreements governing Expedia's indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit its ability to effectively operate its businesses, including those that restrict its ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nborrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase Expedia's capital stock;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;\n\u00b7\nenter into secured financing arrangements;\nI-34\n\u00b7\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u00b7\nenter into unrelated businesses.\nIn addition, Expedia's credit facility requires that it meet certain financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of Expedia's credit facility or any agreement governing its other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply Expedia with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings). In addition, it is possible that Expedia may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of Expedia's credit facility and the indentures governing its outstanding senior notes allow it to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nExpedia and Vitalize cannot be sure that their intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.\nExpedia's and Vitalize's websites and mobile applications rely on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. Expedia and Vitalize establish and protect their intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, license and confidentiality agreements, and internal policies and procedures. In connection with Expedia's and Vitalize's license agreements with third parties, they seek to control access to, and the use and distribution of, their proprietary information and intellectual property. Even with these precautions, however, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use Expedia's or Vitalize's intellectual property without their authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently. Effective trademark, domain name, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which Expedia's and Vitalize's services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Expedia and Vitalize cannot be sure that the steps they have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of their respective intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of these rights could have a material adverse effect on Expedia's and Vitalize\u2019s respective businesses. Furthermore, Expedia or Vitalize may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce their intellectual property rights, to protect their trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nExpedia currently licenses from third parties some of the technologies, content and brands incorporated into its websites. As it continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, content and brands, Expedia may be required to license additional technology, content or brands. Expedia cannot be sure that such technology, content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nVitalize operates in a highly competitive industry and its failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect its sales and growth prospects.\nVitalize competes primarily against other specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations and mail order companies. This market is sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. As certain products become more mainstream, Vitalize experiences increased competition for those products. For example, as the trend in favor of whey protein products developed, it experienced increased competition for whey protein products from supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchants and other food companies. Increased competition from companies that distribute through retail, e-commerce or wholesale channels could have a material adverse effect on Vitalize's financial condition and results of operations. Certain of Vitalize's competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, Vitalize's competitors may be more effective and efficient in introducing new products. Vitalize may not be able to compete effectively, and any of the factors listed above may cause price reductions, reduced margins and losses of market share.\nI-35\nVitalize's failure to appropriately and timely respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products and services could significantly harm its customer relationships and its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVitalize's performance is affected by industry trends including, among others, demographic trends and health and lifestyle preferences, as well as other factors, such as industry media coverage and governmental actions. For example, this industry is subject to potential regulatory activity and other legal matters that could affect the credibility of a given product or category of products. Consumer trends and their overall impact on consumer spending and limited product innovation and introductions in the VMS industry can dramatically affect purchasing patterns. Additionally, Vitalize's performance is affected by competitive trends such as the entry of new competitors, changes in promotional strategies or expansion of product assortment by various competitors.\nSales of sports nutrition products are generally more sensitive to consumer trends, such as increased demand for products recommended by the media, resulting in higher volatility than other products. Accordingly, Vitalize sells what it believes are appropriate sports nutrition products in response to prevailing market conditions and consumer demands.\nVitalize relies on consumer perception regarding the safety, quality and effectiveness of the supplement products it sells, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of products can be significantly influenced by adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, national media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of Vitalize's products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects, or questions the benefits of Vitalize's products or other similar products or that claims that any such products are ineffective. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to the industry or any of Vitalize's specific products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Unfavorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on Vitalize's ability to generate sales.\nVitalize's business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Any failure to accurately predict or react to these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of Vitalize as a source for high demand or the latest products, which in turn could harm its customer relationships and cause it to lose market share. The success of Vitalize's product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to:\n\u00b7\nanticipate customer needs;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully introduce new products in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nprice its products competitively;\n\u00b7\ndeliver its products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7\ndifferentiate its product offerings from those of its competitors.\nVitalize may be subject to material product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products it sells, which could increase its costs and adversely affect its reputation, revenues and operating income.\nSome of the products Vitalize sells, distributes or manufactures may expose it to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Vitalize's products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. These products could contain contaminated substances, and some of the products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers produce many of the products Vitalize sells. Vitalize relies on these manufacturers to ensure the integrity of their ingredients and formulations. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, Vitalize may also be liable for various product liability claims for products it does not manufacture. Moreover, as a practical matter, indemnification from a product supplier is dependent on the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and its insurer, and the absence of significant defenses by the insurers. Vitalize may be unable to obtain full recovery from the insurer or any indemnifying third-party in respect of any claims against it in connection with products manufactured by such third-party.\nI-36\nEven with adequate insurance and indemnification, product liability claims could significantly damage Vitalize's reputation and consumer confidence in its products. Vitalize's litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nVitalize may experience product recalls, withdrawals or seizures, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVitalize may initiate or participate in product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of the products it sells are believed to cause injury or illness or if Vitalize is alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of those products. A significant product recall, withdrawal or seizure may require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected costs and may materially and adversely affect Vitalize's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a significant product recall, withdrawal or seizure may adversely affect consumer confidence in its brands and third-party brands sold by Vitalize and thus decrease consumer demand for products sold by Vitalize.\nAs is common in the VMS industry, Vitalize relies on its contract manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to Vitalize comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, Vitalize seeks representations and warranties, indemnification and insurance from its contract manufacturers and suppliers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage Vitalize's reputation and consumer confidence in its products. In addition, if products offered for sale by Vitalize do not comply with applicable regulatory, statutory and legislative requirements, Vitalize cannot market such products and may be required to recall or remove such products from the market and may face lawsuits related to any alleged non-compliance, which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect Vitalize's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVitalize's business relies on email and other messaging services, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or messages or an inability to timely deliver such communications could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVitalize's business is highly dependent upon email and other messaging services for promoting its sites and products. Vitalize provides emails and other \"push\" communications to customers and other visitors informing them of what is available for purchase on its site that day, and believes these messages are an important part of its marketing and generate a substantial portion of its revenue. If Vitalize is unable to successfully deliver emails or other messages to its subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open its emails or other messages, its revenue and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may also reduce the number of subscribers opening its emails. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of emails or other messages could also adversely impact Vitalize's business. From time to time, Internet service providers or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in Vitalize's inability to successfully deliver emails or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit its ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon Vitalize in connection with sending such communications would also materially and adversely impact its business. Vitalize's use of email and other messaging services to send communications about its site or other matters may also result in legal claims against it, which may cause increased expenses, and if successful may result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations or may limit or prohibit its ability to send emails or other messages. Vitalize also relies on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit Vitalize's ability or its customers' ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Vitalize fails to retain existing users or add new users, or if its users decrease their level of engagement with its products, Vitalize's business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of Vitalize's user base and its users' level of engagement are critical to its success. Vitalize's financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by its success in adding, retaining and engaging active users. If people do not perceive its products to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, Vitalize may not be able to attract\nI-37\nor retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. Vitalize's user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as users continue to engage increasingly via mobile devices and as Vitalize introduces new and different products and services. Any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth and engagement, including if:\n\u00b7\nusers increasingly engage with other products or services;\n\u00b7\nVitalize fails to introduce new products or services that users find engaging or if it introduces new products or services that are not favorably received;\n\u00b7\nusers have difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing its products on mobile devices;\n\u00b7\nuser behavior on any of Vitalize's products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on its products and services;\n\u00b7\nVitalize is unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u00b7\nthere are decreases in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of its products or concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security or other factors;\n\u00b7\nVitalize is unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is interesting, useful and relevant to them;\n\u00b7\nusers adopt new technologies where its products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;\n\u00b7\nthere are adverse changes in Vitalize's products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;\n\u00b7\ntechnical or other problems prevent Vitalize from delivering its products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\n\u00b7\nVitalize adopts policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by its users or the general public;\n\u00b7\nit elects to focus its user growth and engagement efforts more on longer-term initiatives, or if initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by Vitalize, third parties or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nVitalize fails to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers or developers; or\n\u00b7\ndevelopers whose products are integrated with Vitalize or other companies in its industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.\nVitalize\u2019s current or future products, such as its development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on Bodybuilding.com by making it easier for its users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\nAny of the above factors could have a material and adverse effect on Vitalize's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe seasonality of Vitalize's business places increased strain on its operations.\nVitalize derives significant sales during the first quarter of each year. If it does not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that it fails to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect its revenue and future growth. If it overstocks products, it may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. If too many customers access Vitalize's websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, it may experience system interruptions or site performance slowdown that make its website unavailable or prevent it from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of products it sells and the attractiveness of its products and services. In addition, Vitalize may be unable to adequately staff its fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods.\nI-38\nFactors Relating to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off\nWe may have a significant indemnity obligation to Liberty Interactive if the Expedia Holdings Split-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Liberty Interactive received an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that the Expedia Holdings Split-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty Interactive and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the conclusions expressed in such opinion could be challenged by the IRS, and a court could sustain such challenge. In February 2017, the IRS completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Liberty Interactive that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Liberty Interactive received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.\nEven if the Expedia Holdings Split-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D), and related provisions of the Code, the Expedia Holdings Split-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to Liberty Interactive (but not to holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Liberty Interactive or in the stock of our company (excluding, for this purpose, the acquisition of our common stock by holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in the Expedia Holdings Split-Off) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Expedia Holdings Split-Off. Any acquisition of the stock of Liberty Interactive or our company (or any successor corporation) within two years before or after the Expedia Holdings Split-Off would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, Liberty Interactive or we might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Liberty Interactive or our company, thereby triggering tax liability to Liberty Interactive.\nPrior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Interactive. Under this agreement, Liberty Interactive is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, we are required to indemnify Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by our company and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our company (or any successor corporation). Our indemnification obligations to Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries, and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries, or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligation related to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur material costs as a result of our separation from Liberty Interactive.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur costs and expenses not previously incurred as a result of our separation from Liberty Interactive. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d)), tax administration and human resources related functions. Although Liberty Media will continue to provide many of these services for us under the services agreement, we cannot assure you that the services agreement will continue or that these costs will not be material to our business.\nI-39\nPrior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we were not an independent company and we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, additional changes necessary to operate as an independent company.\nPrior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, our business was operated by Liberty Interactive as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Liberty Interactive's senior management oversaw the strategic direction of our businesses and Liberty Interactive (directly and through its services agreement with Liberty Media) performed various corporate functions for us, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nselected human resources related functions;\n\u00b7\ntax administration;\n\u00b7\nselected legal functions (including compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley), as well as external reporting;\n\u00b7\ntreasury administration, investor relations, internal audit and insurance functions; and\n\u00b7\nselected information technology and telecommunications services.\nFollowing the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, neither Liberty Interactive nor Liberty Media has any obligation to provide these functions to us other than those services that are provided by Liberty Media pursuant to the services agreement between us and Liberty Media. If, once our services agreement terminates, we do not have in place our own systems and business functions, we do not have agreements with other providers of these services or we are not able to make these changes cost effectively, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. If Liberty Media does not continue to perform effectively the services to be provided to us under the services agreement, we may not be able to operate our business effectively.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the September 2011 separation of Starz from Liberty Interactive and the January 2013 spin-off of Liberty Media from Starz, most of the executive officers of Expedia Holdings also serve as executive officers of Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media and our Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Board of Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media. Following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, John C. Malone became the Chairman of the Board and a director of our company, Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media, and Christopher W. Shean became the Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of our company, and a Senior Advisor of Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media. None of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company's board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty Interactive or Liberty Media or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty Interactive or Liberty Media pursues corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Our company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and our restated charter provides that no director or officer of our company breaches their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to our company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media) instead of our company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to our company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company or as a director or officer of any of our subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which our company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \"related party transaction\" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty Interactive or Liberty Media and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nI-40\nOur inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty Interactive for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it will provide to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we will pay Liberty Media a services fee. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive, and hence may not be the result of arms' length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media are at arms' length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Liberty Interactive, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.\nFactors Relating to Expedia Holdings' Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions.\nThe fair value of our investment in Expedia, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $2,674 million as of December 31, 2016, which, prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, represented a large portion of the total market value of the Liberty Ventures common stock, as a whole, and, following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, represents an even larger portion of Expedia Holdings\u2019 total market value. As a result of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, our stock price may move in tandem with the Expedia stock price to a greater degree than the Liberty Ventures common stock did prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, with the result that our stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Expedia and developments in its business.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on management's assessment of those matters. Our compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley will first be tested in connection with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our restated charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\nI-41\nPrior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:\n\u00b7\nhaving a board divided into Series B Directors and Common Stock Directors (each as defined in our restated charter), with the Series B Directors having certain powers with respect to the voting of our Expedia common stock in the election of Expedia directors;\n\u00b7\nrequiring that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is necessary to sell or transfer any of the shares of Expedia class B common stock held by our company;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 70% of our voting power or the approval by at least 80% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the size of our board of directors to seven members; and\n\u00b7\nhaving the proxy arrangements terminate upon a change in control of our company, with the voting power over our Expedia common stock reverting to Mr. Diller pursuant to the Diller Proxy.\nPrior to and following the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, except in the election of Common Stock Directors prior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nproviding that all legal actions with respect to derivative claims and fiduciary duty claims be brought exclusively in Delaware courts;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, other than in certain limited circumstances, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nFollowing the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 70% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter.\nCertain other provisions of the proxy arrangements may also have the effect of making an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nExpedia Holdings is subject to ownership concentration by one principal stockholder.\nMalone beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing approximately 33% of Expedia Holdings\u2019 voting power as of January 31, 2017. Malone's equity interest in Expedia Holdings is not subject to any restrictions in favor of Expedia Holdings other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary transfer restrictions pursuant to incentive award agreements. Malone's rights to vote or dispose of his equity interest in Expedia Holdings is, however, subject to restrictions pursuant to the terms of the proxy arrangements.\nI-42\nUntil the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, Malone and his wife have granted Mr. Diller an irrevocable proxy over the shares of Expedia Holdings common stock beneficially owned by the Malone Group (the \u201cCovered Shares\u201d). As a result, Mr. Diller will vote the Covered Shares in matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, subject to limited exceptions. As a result of the voting power attributed to the Covered Shares, Mr. Diller will also effectively be able to block certain actions by Expedia Holdings prior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, including, but not limited to, certain amendments to our restated charter and bylaws and the transfer of all or any portion of the shares of Expedia class B common stock owned by Expedia Holdings. Mr. Diller will also be able to replace the Series B Directors though Malone will retain the right to remove the Series B Directors. Following the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, Malone and his wife will resume full voting control over the Covered Shares.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our restated charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16493, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "LEXEA"}
