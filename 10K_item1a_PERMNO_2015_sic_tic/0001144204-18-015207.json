{"cik": "1404296", "company": "Atlantic Coast Financial CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, and an investment in our common stock, involves risks. The risk factors which management believes are material to our business and could negatively affect our results of operations, our financial condition and the trading value of our common stock are summarized below. Other risk factors not currently known to management, or risk factors that are currently deemed to be immaterial or unlikely, could also adversely affect our business. In assessing the following risk factors, investors should also refer to the other information contained in this Report and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to our Merger with Ameris\nBecause the market price of Ameris common stock may fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive until the closing.\nUpon completion of the Ameris Merger, each share of Company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.17 shares of Ameris common stock and (ii) a cash amount equal to $1.39 ((i) and (ii) together, the merger consideration). The market value of the stock portion of the merger consideration will fluctuate from the closing price of Ameris common stock on the date Ameris and we announced the merger, the date of our special meeting relating to the merger, and the date the merger is completed and thereafter. There will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of either shares of Ameris common stock or shares of Company common stock; provided that if (i) the average closing price of Ameris common stock over a specified period prior to completion of the merger decreases below certain specified thresholds and (ii) we elect to terminate the merger agreement due to such decrease, then Ameris may elect to increase the merger consideration as outlined in the merger agreement. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of Ameris, including, but not limited to, general market and economic conditions, changes in Ameris\u2019 business, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. We make no assurances as to whether or when the merger will be completed. Therefore, at the time of our special meeting, shareholders will not know the precise market value of the aggregate merger consideration shareholders will be entitled to receive at the effective time of the merger. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Ameris and Company common stock before you vote.\nThe Ameris Merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including approval by our shareholders.\nSpecified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, the merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of Ameris and the Company may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.\nThe termination fees and the restrictions on third party proposals set forth in the Merger Agreement may discourage others from trying to acquire the Company.\nUntil the completion of the Ameris Merger, with some exceptions, we are prohibited from participating in any discussion of or otherwise considering any inquiries or proposals that may lead to a proposal to acquire the Company, such as a merger or other business combination transaction, with any person other than Ameris. In addition, we have agreed to pay to Ameris in certain circumstances a termination fee equal to $5.75 million. These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror from trying to acquire us even though this third party might be willing to offer greater value to our shareholders than Ameris has offered in the merger. Similarly, such a competing acquiror might propose a price lower than it might otherwise have been willing to offer because of the potential added expense of the termination fee that may become payable to Ameris in certain circumstances under the Merger Agreement. The payment of any termination fee could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Ameris Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Ameris.\nBefore the Ameris Merger can be completed, various approvals or consents must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities. These authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the or require changes to its terms. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals or waivers could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger. The regulatory approvals or waivers may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion or may contain conditions on the completion of the merger that are that are burdensome, not anticipated or cannot be met. If the completion of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary governmental approvals or waivers, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may also be materially adversely affected.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Ameris Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Ameris Merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could negatively affect our and Ameris combined business operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, depositors and borrowers pending the consummation of the merger, as such personnel, depositors and borrowers may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers, vendors and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us or fail to extend an existing relationship with us. In addition, competitors may target each party\u2019s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger.\nThe pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of our operations into Ameris\u2019 may place a burden on each company\u2019s management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on each company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Our retention of certain employees also may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Ameris after the merger. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, in the merger agreement requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to closing and we are restricted from taking certain actions without Ameris\u2019 consent while the merger is pending. These restrictions may, among other matters, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, selling assets, incurring indebtedness, engaging in significant capital expenditures in excess of certain limits set forth in the merger agreement, entering into other transactions or making other changes to our business prior to consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure of the Ameris Merger to be consummated, the termination of the Merger Agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the merger could negatively impact the Company.\nIf the Ameris Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our or Ameris\u2019 common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may be materially adversely affected. If the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the merger.\nAdditionally, the Ameris/Company Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed on Form S-4, filed on February 14, 2018, includes \u201cRisk Factors\u201d related to the merger and an investment in Ameris\u2019 common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nRepayment risk associated with our adjustable rate loans may increase as interest rates rise.\nGiven the historically low interest rate environment in recent years, our adjustable rate loans have not been subject to an interest rate environment that causes them to adjust to the maximum level. As interest rates rise, such loans may involve repayment risks resulting from potentially increasing payment obligations by borrowers due to re-pricing. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately $354.7 million in adjustable rate loans, which made up 46.3% of our loan portfolio.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly reduce our profitability, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur earnings largely depend on the relationship between the yield on our earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, commonly known as the net interest margin, is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors that influence the yields and rates for, and the volume and mix of, our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on our net interest income. Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities. We are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of our balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income, is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios. Management\u2019s objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in our balance sheet.\nFuture changes in interest rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FRB maintained the federal funds rate at the historically low rate of 0.25% during 2014 and through mid-December 2015. The rate was raised to a target rate of 0.50% in December 2015, 0.75% in December 2016, and then 1.00%, 1.25%, and 1.50% in March, June, and December 2017, respectively. It is currently unclear what the FRB intends to do in 2018. The federal funds rate has a direct correlation to general rates of interest, including our interest-bearing deposits. Our mix of asset and liabilities are considered to be sensitive to interest rate changes. Generally, customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the amount of such prepayments, are within our customers\u2019 discretion. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A similar prepayment risk exists for our investment portfolio which is primarily made up of mortgage-related securities, with the added impact of accelerated recognition of premiums paid to acquire the investment security. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, net interest income might be reduced because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, including loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In addition, rising interest rates may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations because higher rates may reduce the demand for loans and the value of mortgage-related investment securities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, could hurt our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 91.3% of our portfolio loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Real estate values and the real estate markets are generally affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, the availability of credit, changes in tax laws and other statutes, regulations, and policies, and acts of nature. Weakening of the real estate market could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing those loans, which in turn could adversely affect our profitability and asset quality. If we were required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, weakness in the secondary market for residential lending could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Significant disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans may limit the market for and liquidity of mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. The effects of potential market challenges and uncertainty, including uncertainty with respect to U.S. monetary policy, could result in price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held, any future mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and charge-offs in future periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our number of commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and multi-family loans and consumer loans, which could increase our level of provision expense.\nOur outstanding commercial real estate, commercial business, construction and multi-family real estate loans and our manufactured home, automobile and other consumer loans, in aggregate, accounted for approximately 55.9% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Generally, management considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner occupied residential properties.\nHistorically, these loans have had higher risks than loans secured by residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Business Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u00b7 Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u00b7 Single Family Construction Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful completion of the project and the ability of the contractor or builder to repay the loan from the sale of the property or obtaining permanent financing;\n\u00b7 Commercial and Multi-Family Construction Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the completion of the project and income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The collateral cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate and may involve expensive workout techniques. It may also involve large balances of loans to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Commercial business loans may be collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, etc. which are difficult to liquidate in an event of default; and\n\u00b7 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as automobile and manufactured home loans) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\nIf these non-residential loans become nonperforming, we may have to increase our provision expense which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur current asset mix and our current investments may not be indicative of our future asset mix and investments, which may make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating performance.\nCertain factors make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating performance including, among others: (i) our current asset mix may not be representative of our anticipated future asset mix and may change as we continue to execute on our plans for organic loan origination and banking activities and potentially grow through future acquisitions; (ii) our significant liquid securities portfolio may not necessarily be representative of our future liquid securities position; and (iii) our cost structure and capital expenditure requirements during the periods for which financial information is available may not be reflective of our anticipated cost structure and capital spending as we continue to realize efficiencies in our business, integrate future acquisitions and continue to grow our organic banking platform.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate or the economic recovery from such deterioration remains slow over an extended period of time in our primary market areas of Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia, our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted as borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases. This geographic concentration in loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate may increase credit losses, which could increase the level of provision expense.\nOur financial results and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest rates, which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and the Florida and Georgia state governments and other significant external events. Our market share of loans in Ware County, Georgia is significantly greater than our share of the loan market in the Jacksonville, Orlando or Tampa, Florida metropolitan areas. As a result of the concentration in Ware County, we may be more susceptible to adverse market conditions in that market. Due to the significant portion of real estate loans in the loan portfolio, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral.\nAdverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to portfolio lending during a period of rising real estate values, high sales volume activity and historically low interest rate environment. The resulting high loan-to-value ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio expose us to greater risk of loss.\nMuch of our portfolio lending is in one- to four-family residential properties generally located throughout Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia. Because many of our portfolio loans were originated during a period of rising real estate values and historically low interest rates, based on the Company\u2019s most recent analysis, approximately 2.5% of the residential loan portfolio collateral is deficient due to a decline in real estate values since origination.\nMany of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on real property, and we believe some of our borrowers may have reduced equity. Residential loans with high loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and, therefore, may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings may be reduced.\nOur nonperforming assets may increase in future periods. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or real estate owned. We must establish the allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through the current period provision expenses, which are recorded as a charge to income. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are substantial collections costs, such as legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to OREO. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from our overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities.\nLegislative action regarding foreclosures or bankruptcy laws may negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nCertain laws adopted following the financial crisis delay the initiation or completion of foreclosure proceedings on specified types of residential mortgage loans (some for a limited period of time), or otherwise limit the ability of residential loan servicers to take actions that may be essential to preserve the value of the mortgage loans. Any such limitations are likely to cause delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors and generally increased servicing costs. Any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forego a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms will in some instances require us to advance principal, interest, tax and insurance payments, which is likely to negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe continue to hold and acquire OREO which may lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to declines in real property values.\nWe foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for some of our loans as part of our business. Real estate owned by us and not used in the ordinary course of operations is referred to as OREO. In the past, increased OREO balances have led to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties. Our earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in OREO. Any decrease in real estate market prices could lead to additional OREO write-downs, with a corresponding expense in our statement of operations. We evaluate OREO properties periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluation require it. The potential expenses associated with OREO and any further write-downs on such properties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to properties that we take title to upon foreclosure that could increase our costs of doing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn the course of our activities, we may foreclose and take title to residential and commercial properties and become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. The laws and regulations related to environmental contamination often impose liability without regard to responsibility for the contamination. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. Moreover, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based upon damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local markets or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur market areas in Florida and Georgia are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by such future weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in the delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes, tropical storms, related flooding and wind damage and other similar weather events. As a result of the potential for such weather events, many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets, which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in our markets.\nIf the allowance for portfolio loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual portfolio loan losses, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nIn the event loan customers do not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral security for the payments of these loans is insufficient to satisfy any remaining loan balance, we may experience significant loan losses. Such credit risk is inherent in the lending business, and failure to adequately assess such credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of the loans. In determining the amount of the allowance, management reviews the loan portfolio and our historical loss and delinquency experience, as well as overall economic conditions. For larger balance non-homogeneous real estate loans, the estimate of impairment is based on the underlying collateral if collateral-dependent, and if such loans are not collateral-dependent, the estimate of impairment is based on a cash flow analysis. If management\u2019s assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may be insufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for portfolio loan losses. The allowance for portfolio loan losses is also periodically reviewed by the OFR and the FDIC, who may require us to increase the amount. Additions to the allowance for portfolio loan losses would be made through increased provision expense and would negatively affect our net income and results of operations.\nOperating expenses are high as a percentage of our net interest income and noninterest income, making it more difficult to maintain profitability.\nNoninterest expense, which consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our business, represents a high percentage of the income we generate. The cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio, which represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income. If we are able to lower our efficiency ratio, our ability to generate income from our operations will be more effective. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our efficiency ratios were 75.2%, 70.1%, and 103.5%, respectively. Generally, this means we spent approximately $0.75, $0.70, and $1.04 during those periods to generate $1.00 of income.\nIf we are unable to generate noninterest income from sales of loans originated for sale, it could have an adverse effect on our business because service charges and deposit fees are expected to continue to be under pressure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our service charges and deposit fees were 25.4% of total noninterest income, while gains from the sale of mortgage loans and the sale of commercial loans originated for sale under government programs was 32.4% of total noninterest income. Gains earned from the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale and from the sale of commercial loans originated for sale under government programs are expected to be an increasingly larger part of our noninterest income under our business strategy. If our plans to increase our mortgage banking business and SBA/USDA lending are not successful, resulting in less loan originations or smaller levels of gains, our operating results could be materially affected.\nWe may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating taxable income, and future tax benefits will be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense which will have a positive non-cash impact on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. In addition, changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets.\nStrong competition in our primary market areas may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and also increase our cost of funds.\nThe Bank operates in very competitive markets for the attraction of deposits, the primary source of our funding. Historically, our most direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks and thrift institutions within our primary market areas. In recent years, competition has also come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the internet. Such competitors have the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs and substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services we do not provide. Particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, we have faced significant competition for investors\u2019 funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. During periods of regularly increasing interest rates, competition for interest-bearing deposits increases as customers, particularly time deposit customers, tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market. As a result, we incur a higher cost of funds in an effort to attract and retain customer deposits. We strive to grow our lower cost deposits, such as noninterest-bearing checking accounts, in order to reduce our cost of funds.\nWholesale funding sources may be unavailable to replace deposits at maturity and support our liquidity needs or growth, which could materially adversely impact our operating margins and profitability.\nThe Bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As part of our liquidity management, we use a number of wholesale funding sources in addition to non-maturity deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments.\nOur financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as Atlantic Coast Bank, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If our financial condition deteriorates or if the Bank's regulators otherwise have supervisory concerns, then our assessments could rise. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nNew mortgage lending rules may constrain Atlantic Coast Bank\u2019s residential mortgage lending business.\nOver the course of the last few years, the CFPB has issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability. In either case, the Bank may find it necessary to tighten its mortgage loan underwriting standards, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies.\nFinancial reform legislation may continue to result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations and compliance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nWe expect that our operating and compliance costs, and possibly our interest expense, could increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations. The need to comply with additional rules and regulations, as well as state laws and regulations, will also divert management\u2019s time from managing our operations. Higher capital levels would reduce our ability to grow and increase our interest-earning assets which would adversely affect our return on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe are also subject to fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. Both federal/state agencies and individuals can challenge an institution's performance under these laws. This can impact our ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, etc., which could negatively impact business and operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules are uncertain and could materially adversely impact our business and ability to pay dividends or buyback our shares in the future.\nOn July 2, 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final capital rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply both to our Company, which currently is not subject to formal capital rules, and Atlantic Coast Bank. The final rules resulted in higher regulatory capital standards, which may result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, or result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank would have been in compliance with the minimum capital requirements set forth in Basel III.\nAdditionally, in any economic or regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for Atlantic Coast Bank could, also limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nThe federal banking agencies are likely to issue new liquidity standards that could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nAs part of the Basel III capital process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a new Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which requires a banking organization to hold sufficient \u201chigh quality liquid assets\u201d to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario, and a Net Stable Funding Ratio, which imposes a similar requirement over a one-year period. The U.S. banking regulators have said that they intend to adopt such liquidity standards, although they have not yet proposed a rule. New rules could restrict our operations and adversely affect our results and financial condition, by requiring us to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nFlorida financial institutions face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with the Bank Secrecy Act and other Anti-Money Laundering statutes and regulations.\nBanking regulators intensely focus on Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, particularly the Anti-Money Laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Banking regulators and examiners are aggressive in their supervision and examination of financial institutions located in the State of Florida with respect to institutions\u2019 Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance. Consequently, a number of formal enforcement actions have been issued against Florida financial institutions.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines, and examination procedures in this area, the Bank has been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. If the Bank has policies, procedures, and systems that are deemed deficient, then the Bank would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan including its acquisition plans.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nOur future success will depend on management\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy, which includes managing nonperforming assets and operating expenses, continuing to grow our mortgage banking, our commercial and industrial lending, warehouse lending, and small business lending businesses, as well as our banking services to small businesses. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully implement our strategy, it will take time to fully implement our strategy. We expect that it may take a significant period of time before we can achieve the intended results of our business strategy. During the period we are implementing our plan, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, even if our strategy is successfully implemented, it may not produce positive results.\nAdditionally, future success in the expansion of mortgage banking, commercial and industrial lending, warehouse lending, and small business lending businesses will depend on management\u2019s ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated loan originators. The Bank competes against many institutions with greater financial resources to attract these qualified individuals. Failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.\nOur enterprise risk management framework is designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management framework in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes, invest in technological improvements, and manage our information systems and related risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in operations. We may need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. Failures or interruptions affecting information technology and telecommunications systems maintained by us or our service providers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle currently or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. Further, in some instances we may be responsible for the failure of such third parties to comply with government regulations. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and our insurance coverage may not be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in our business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks associated with our on-line banking services and our reliance on electronic data transfer. Failure to detect or prevent a breach of our technological infrastructure or information security systems, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of a cyberattack, \u201chacking\u201d or identity theft, could disrupt our business, result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or propriety information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, or have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As noted, above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking and other businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and e-mail systems, software and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in places, our technologies, systems, networks and our client\u2019s devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the misappropriation of clients\u2019 funds, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our client\u2019s confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. Therefore, a successful breach could result in significant financial loss to the Company, as well as damage our reputation in the markets we serve, the banking industry in general, and among our counterparties.\nWe may be subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if any of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems or if one of our third-party service providers experiences an operational breakdown or failure. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Bank is currently subject to extensive laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by the FDIC (which insures the Bank\u2019s deposits) and the OFR. As a bank holding company, we are also currently subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities. Intended to protect clients, depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and the overall financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations or restrictions on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to the Company, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than U.S. GAAP, among other things.\nOur operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and local governmental authorities, and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on our operations. These laws, rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities. In the future, changes to existing laws, rules and regulations, or any other new laws, rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are currently facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the financial crisis in the banking and financial markets, and, to the extent that we participate in any programs established or to be established by the U.S. Treasury or by the federal bank regulatory agencies, there will be additional and changing requirements and conditions imposed on us. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure is inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nWe rely on our management team for the successful implementation of our business strategy.\nTurnover of key management and directors, or the loss of other senior managers could have a disproportionate impact on the Company and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan. As we are a relatively small bank with a relatively small management team, certain members of our senior management team have more responsibility than his or her counterpart typically would have at a larger institution with more employees, and we have fewer management-level personnel who are in a position to assume the responsibilities of our executive management team.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is relatively small, approximately 52,000 shares per day in 2017, and sometimes significantly less than that. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock, and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price. If our Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (as defined under NASDAQ rules) falls below $5.0 million or the price per share of the common stock falls below $1.00 for a specified amount of time, under applicable NASDAQ rules, we will generally have 180 calendar days from the date of the receipt of the notification from NASDAQ that we have failed to comply with its applicable listing standards to regain compliance with those standards. If we are unable to regain compliance, we may have to transfer the listing of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market or begin trading on the over-the-counter market, which may adversely affect the trading market for our shares.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited.\nWe have not paid dividends to our common stockholders since July 2009. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the Merger Agreement, regulatory requirements and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital to meet the capital needs of our business, including capital needs related to future growth. The Company\u2019s primary source of funds available for the payment of dividends is the dividend payments we receive from Atlantic Coast Bank.\nA Florida state-chartered commercial bank may not pay cash dividends that would cause the bank\u2019s capital to fall below the minimum amount required by federal or state law. Accordingly, Florida state-chartered commercial banks may only pay dividends out of the total of current net profits plus retained net profits of the preceding two years to the extent it deems expedient, except no bank may pay a dividend at any time such that the total of net income for the current year when combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, produces a loss. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to pay dividends to common stockholders in the future, and, if we are able to pay dividends, we cannot provide assurances as to the amount or timing of any such dividends. If we are able to pay dividends in the future, we cannot provide assurances that those dividends will be maintained, at the same level or at all, in future periods.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, and any additional financing may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nIf the Ameris Merger is not consummated for any reason, we may need to obtain additional financing in the future for a variety of reasons, including meeting our regulatory obligations, conducting our ongoing operations, or funding expansion, as well as to respond to unanticipated situations. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor interest. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, it could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90399, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "ACFC"}
