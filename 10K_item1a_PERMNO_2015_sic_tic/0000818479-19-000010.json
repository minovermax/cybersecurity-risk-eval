{"cik": "818479", "company": "DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business, financial condition or future results. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\nThe Company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, the Company may announce restructuring plans from time to time, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. The Company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred. Consistent with these efforts, on November 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure the Company\u2019s business to support revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify its organization. The Company expects to incur approximately $275 million in one-time expenditures and charges through 2021. The Company anticipates a net reduction in global workforce of approximately 6% to 8%. There can be no assurance that the cost reductions and results will be achieved.\nDue to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities, and the quarterly phasing of related investments, the Company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits, and its operations and business could be disrupted. Company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions, and implementation may require the agreement of third parties, such as labor unions or works councils. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impact on the Company\u2019s relationship with labor unions or works councils, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in 2017 and 2018 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nThe Company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. The Company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. Events or changes indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include reduced future cash flow estimates, slower growth rates in industry segments in which the Company participates and a decline in our stock price and market capitalization. The Company may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.\nDuring 2017 and 2018 the Company had recorded an aggregate of $3.3 billion in charges for the impairment of certain financial reporting units:\n\u2022In connection with the Company\u2019s April 30, 2017 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a $1,092.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the CAD/CAM and Imaging reporting units and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $79.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.\n\u2022In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified a triggering event and recorded a $558.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to these reporting units and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $266.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n\u2022In connection with the Company\u2019s April 30, 2018 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a $1,085.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM and Imaging equipment reporting units and the Orthodontics reporting unit. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the equipment reporting units and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $179.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.\nThese charges resulted from changes in the Company\u2019s estimates of discounted cash flows which, in turn, resulted from changes in management\u2019s assumptions such as future revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries. Given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management\u2019s assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s discounted cash flow model, the Company\u2019s current estimates could vary significantly in the future, which may result in a goodwill impairment charge at that time. For example, for the Company\u2019s reporting units that were not impaired at April 30, 2018, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. Had the discount rate of each of these reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at April 30, 2018, the fair value of one reporting unit, Treatment Centers, would not exceed net book value. If the fair value of each of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10% at April 30, 2018, the fair value of one reporting unit, Treatment Centers, would not exceed net book value. Goodwill for the Treatment Centers reporting unit totals $292.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nAny changes to the assumptions and estimates made by management may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in the Treatment Centers reporting unit may not be recoverable. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results and market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to be volatile.\nDentsply Sirona has experienced in 2018 and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors, some of which are substantially outside of the Company\u2019s control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the execution of the Company\u2019s restructuring plan;\n\u2022the complexity of the organization;\n\u2022the timing of new product introductions by Dentsply Sirona and its competitors;\n\u2022the timing of industry trade shows;\n\u2022changes in customer inventory levels;\n\u2022developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies;\n\u2022changes in customer preferences and product mix;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to meet customer demand;\n\u2022fluctuations in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022competitors\u2019 sales promotions;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries.\nAs a result, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause its stock price to decline. Quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters, primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters, but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.\nIn addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings, a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s common stock causing volatility. These factors include, but are not limited to, the publication of earnings estimates or other reports and speculation in the press or investment community; changes in the Company\u2019s industry and competitors; the Company\u2019s financial condition and cash flows; any future issuances of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time; general market and economic conditions; and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in geographical areas in which the Company does business.\nAlso, the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nDentsply Sirona is dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue, and loss of these key distributors could result in a loss of a significant amount of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue has come from a limited number of distributors. For example, the Company's two largest distributors accounted for approximately 15% of the annual revenue of Dentsply Sirona for the year ended December 31, 2018. It is anticipated that Patterson and Henry Schein will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that Patterson Companies, Inc. and Henry Schein, Inc. will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from Dentsply Sirona or that they will continue to purchase any products at all. If Patterson or Henry Schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from Dentsply Sirona, it could have a material adverse effect on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Dentsply Sirona cannot assure that the cessation of exclusivity will not adversely affect the Companys results of operations.\nThe Company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims.\nThe Company faces the risk of purported securities class actions, investigations by governmental agencies, product liability and other types of legal actions or claims, including possible recall actions affecting the Company\u2019s products. The primary litigation risks to which the Company is exposed are related to defending against various putative class action suits in federal and state court alleging that the Company and certain of its present and former officers and directors violated U.S. securities laws by allegedly making false and misleading statements in connection with a February 2016 registration statement issued in connection with the merger with former Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. by the entity formerly known as Dentsply International Inc., and in connection with the Company's regular securities filings, and to lawsuits related to the products manufactured by the Company. The Company has insurance policies, including directors and officers\u2019 insurance and product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Also, other types of claims asserted against the Company may not be covered by insurance. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its business and overall cash flows of the Company.\nVarious parties, including the Company, own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields. Although the Company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company\u2019s products infringe upon such party\u2019s intellectual property and force the Company to pay damages and/or discontinue the sale of certain products.\nThe Company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks, and any cyber-attacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm the Company\u2019s operations.\nDue to the global nature of the Company\u2019s business and reliance on information systems to provide the Company\u2019s services, the Company may use web-enabled and other integrated information systems in delivering the Company\u2019s services. As the breadth and complexity of Company\u2019s information systems continue to grow, the Company will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development, integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems, including:\n\u2022disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms;\n\u2022security breaches of, cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware; and\n\u2022excessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nAny disruption to the Internet or to the Company\u2019s or its service providers\u2019 global technology infrastructure, including malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate networks, data leakage and human error, could pose a threat to the Company\u2019s operations. The Company\u2019s network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions and the Company may be the victim of cyber-attacks, targeted at the theft of financial assets, intellectual property, personal information of individuals and customers, or other sensitive information. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to ensure the integrity of the Company\u2019s systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that the Company or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the Company\u2019s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause the Company to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the day-to-day management of the Company\u2019s business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect the Company in the event of a system failure. Further, the Company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt, processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions the Company take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the Company\u2019s servers.\nAny of the foregoing incidents could also subject the Company to liability, expose the Company to significant expense, or cause significant harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could result in lost revenues. While Dentsply Sirona has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate the Company from cyber-attacks, technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nInadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products may cause Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue to decline.\nThird-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. While Dentsply Sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third-party payors will have on future sales of our products, there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue to decline.\nDue to the Company\u2019s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nDue to the international nature of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business, movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the Company. With approximately two-thirds of the Company\u2019s sales located in regions outside the U.S., the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as a number of the Company\u2019s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the U.S. Changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 access to credit as well as on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets. Although the Company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the Company. Additionally, as a result of Brexit or other similar future actions in the EU, global markets and foreign currencies may be adversely impacted. Volatility in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options.\nOn August 8, 2018, S&P Global Ratings lowered its long-term issuer credit rating on the Company to \u2018BBB\u2019 from \u2018BBB+\u2019. The Company utilizes the short and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in our credit ratings or disruptions in the credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options, including our access to the unsecured borrowing market. We may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives.\nChanges in or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rates.\nThe Company is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in the Company\u2019s tax rates could affect its future results of operations. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by factors such as changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business, by structural changes in the Company\u2019s businesses, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This law may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s U.S. tax liabilities, particularly as a result of certain complex international provisions contained in the law in light of the Company's extensive international operations. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") began to issue major proposed regulations related to this law during the second half of 2018 and are expected to continue issuing such regulations through spring of 2019. The proposed regulations are generally subject to comment before being finalized. While there can be no assurance as to the impact of any additional guidance by the IRS, or of any guidance that may be issued by the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company has recorded a provisional amount of income tax to reflect the impact of the law change based on management\u2019s current interpretation of the new legislation. The ultimate impact of U.S. tax reform could be materially different from current estimates based on the Company\u2019s actual results and further analysis of the new law. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nProduct warranty claims exposure could be significant.\nDentsply Sirona generally warrants each of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer. The future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. Successful product warranty claims brought against Dentsply Sirona could reduce Dentsply Sirona\u2019s profits and/or impair our financial condition, and damage Dentsply Sirona\u2019s reputation.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary technology could hurt Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitive position.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s success will depend in part on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products, technologies and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. Risks and uncertainties that Dentsply Sirona faces with respect to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patents and patent applications include the following:\n\u2022the pending patent applications that Dentsply Sirona has filed, or to which Dentsply Sirona has exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than Dentsply Sirona expects to result in issued patents;\n\u2022the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents licensed or issued to Dentsply Sirona may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u2022other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to Dentsply Sirona;\n\u2022disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by Dentsply Sirona and Dentsply Sirona\u2019s respective licensors; and\n\u2022other companies may design around the technologies patented by Dentsply Sirona.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or if Dentsply Sirona's products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or misappropriate Dentsply Sirona\u2019s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses. To protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s rights to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property, Dentsply Sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with Dentsply Sirona\u2019s employees, strategic partners and others. Dentsply Sirona cannot assure you that any of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patents, any of the patents of which Dentsply Sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to Dentsply Sirona or which we may license in the future, will provide Dentsply Sirona with a competitive advantage or afford Dentsply Sirona protection against infringement by others, or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, including Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitors. The protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary information. Dentsply Sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights. Effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which Dentsply Sirona will offer, or intend to offer, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products. Any failure to adequately protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property could devalue Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary content and impair Dentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Further, defending Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nLitigation may also be necessary to enforce Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against Dentsply Sirona. In addition, Dentsply Sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or other foreign patent governing authorities, to determine the priority of inventions, which could result in substantial costs. Acquisitions by Dentsply Sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk.\nIf Dentsply Sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings, Dentsply Sirona may incur substantial expense, and the proceedings may divert the attention of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s technical and management personnel, even if Dentsply Sirona ultimately prevails. An adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities, allow Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from Dentsply Sirona, prohibit Dentsply Sirona from marketing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Dentsply Sirona cannot obtain such licenses, Dentsply Sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products.\nThe enforcement, defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s, the European Patent Office\u2019s and other foreign patent offices\u2019 interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, these proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022assert against others or defend Dentsply Sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement;\n\u2022enforce patents owned by, or licensed to Dentsply Sirona from, another party;\n\u2022protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022determine the enforceability, scope and validity of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others.\nDue to the international nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company\u2019s sales are located in regions outside the United States. In addition, we anticipate that sales outside of the U.S. and Europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue. Operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022economic and political instability;\n\u2022import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022additional compliance-related risks;\n\u2022trade restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022product registration requirements;\n\u2022longer payment cycles;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights.\nCertain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates, both of which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs, regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nA large number of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured or obtained from sole source manufacturing facilities and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.\nAlthough the Company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities, a large number of the products manufactured by the Company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products. As there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products, any disruption at a particular Company manufacturing facility could lead to delays, increased expenses, and may damage the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products, certain dental cutting instruments, catheters, nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal, some of which may also compete with the Company. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products. In addition, these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the Company at any time or supply products to competitors. Dentsply Sirona may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers. If the Company is unable to develop reasonably priced alternative sources in a timely manner, or if the Company encounters delays or other difficulties in the supply or manufacturing of such products and other materials internally or from third parties, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be harmed.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending.\nCertain dental specialty products, dental equipment and products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the Company's business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance.\nDentsply Sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under Dentsply Sirona\u2019s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement.\nThe Company has debt securities outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion. Dentsply Sirona also has the ability to incur up to $700.0 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility, as discussed below, and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness;\n\u2022requiring Dentsply Sirona to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, which would reduce the funds the Company has available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\n\u2022reducing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. Under the Note Purchase Agreement dated December 11, 2015, the Company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 0.6 to 1.0, and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the Note Purchase Agreement. All of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants. The Company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios, though no assurance can be given that Dentsply Sirona will be able to do so. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness.\nThe Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios, which it is required to satisfy. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions, the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense, would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle Dentsply Sirona\u2019s other lenders to accelerate their loans. Dentsply Sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate the business.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control. Although senior management believes that the Company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate its business.\nCertain provisions in the Company\u2019s governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Dentsply Sirona.\nCertain provisions of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of Dentsply Sirona. Such provisions include, among others, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend Dentsply Sirona\u2019s By-laws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d with beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to prevent fraud while growing, restructuring and managing the business is dependent on the management of the Company\u2019s financial reporting and internal controls.\nThe Company\u2019s implementation of its business plans, restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that Dentsply Sirona effectively manage it's financial reporting and internal controls. During this period of restructuring and other organizational changes, the Company continues to focus on maintaining effective internal controls so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the Company's financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operating results could be harmed if Dentsply Sirona cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires Dentsply Sirona to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including managements\u2019 assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its certain limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If Dentsply Sirona fails to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if Dentsply Sirona experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and Dentsply Sirona could fail to meet Dentsply Sirona\u2019s reporting obligations.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations, which could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nDentsply Sirona is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders relating to health care fraud, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010 (c.23), Brazil\u2019s Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12,846) and China's National Health and Family Planning Commission (\u201cNHFPC\u201d) circulars No. 49 and No. 50. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payors and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payors and programs.\nThe U.S. government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise Dentsply Sirona\u2019s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the U.S.Physician Payment Sunshine Act and similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, such as France\u2019s Loi Bertrand and rules issued by Denmark\u2019s Health and Medicines Authority, the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us. This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.\nFailure to comply with health care fraud laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require Dentsply Sirona to make changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.\nWe cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, or the interpretation thereof, or changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s services or marketing practices in response, could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nThe success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions and dispositions.\nWith respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses, the Company may not achieve expected returns and other benefits associated with business combinations as a result of various factors, including integration and collaboration challenges, such as personnel and technology. In addition, the Company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities. Further, acquisitions or dispositions may distract the Company\u2019s management\u2019s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers, employees, suppliers or other parties. However, the Company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the Company achieve its strategic objectives, and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy.\nAfter reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent the Company from completing the transaction in a timely manner, or at all. From a workforce perspective, risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include, among others, delays in anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impacts on the Company\u2019s relationship with labor unions, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWhen the Company decides to sell assets or a business, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, the Company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the Company had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested business, or other conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, could affect its future financial results.\nIn the context of acquisitions, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management\u2019s attention from normal business operations. The Company may not achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition. If the Company makes acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities and/or additional risks, or create additional expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the Company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results.\nInventories maintained by the Company\u2019s customers may fluctuate from time to time.\nThe Company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results. These inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from the Company\u2019s predictions, resulting in the Company\u2019s projections of future results being different than expected. These changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers, economic conditions and customer preference for particular products. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the Company\u2019s predictions or past history, or that the timing of customers\u2019 inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the Company\u2019s predictions or past history.\nDentsply Sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose Dentsply Sirona to loss or limit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s potential gains.\nAs part of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s risk management program, we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, these transactions may limit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s potential gains or expose Dentsply Sirona to loss. Should Dentsply Sirona\u2019s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.\nWe enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and although Dentsply Sirona\u2019s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by Dentsply Sirona\u2019s counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in Dentsply Sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates. If such events occur, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMost of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under Dentsply Sirona\u2019s multi-currency revolving credit facility. The failure of any bank in which we deposit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s funds or that is part of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s multi-currency revolving credit facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nThe Company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products or maintain approvals for existing products.\nThe worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change, new intellectual property associated with that technological change, evolving industry standards, and new product introductions. Additionally, some markets for products, such as orthodontics, are also subject to significant negative price pressures. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life. There can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors, or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the Company\u2019s investment in product development. If the Company\u2019s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business could be negatively affected.\nThe size and number of the Company\u2019s competitors vary by product line and from region to region. Certain of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitors may have greater resources than the Company. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label, generic, or low cost products that compete with the Company\u2019s products at lower price points. If these competitors\u2019 products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall, this could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nDentsply Sirona has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona will be able to continue to develop innovative products or that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained from applicable U.S. or international government or regulatory authorities, or that if such approvals are obtained, such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors\u2019 new products will not be introduced that could render the Company\u2019s products obsolete.\nThe Company\u2019s products will need to be certified under the European Medical Directive that has been revised to become the Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d). Dentsply Sirona as well as all medical device manufacturers have to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under MDR in order to continue to sell those products in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The new regulations become effective in May 2020, which will require the Company to have all products it markets and sells in Europe certified before this date. The Company is in the process of certification. Failure to have the certification completed by May 2020 could unfavorably impact the Company\u2019s sales and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) is currently negotiating exit from the EU, \"Brexit\". Terms of the Brexit agreement could impact the UK\u2019s ability to certify medical devices for sale in the EU. The Company has been working on alternative plans for the impacted products. The inability to certify the Company\u2019s products for sale in the EU could unfavorable impact the Company\u2019s sales.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s business is subject to extensive, complex and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nDentsply Sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders which are administered by various international, federal and state governmental authorities, including, among others, the FDA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cBIS\u201d), the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), and other similar domestic and foreign authorities. These laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders include, but are not limited to, the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the European Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (\u201cMDD\u201d) (1993) (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), the Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), France\u2019s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar international anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the \u201cClean Water Act\u201d), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), and regulations relating to trade, import and export controls and economic sanctions. Such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change. For example, since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially affect the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and customers with operations connected to the United Kingdom. Any such changes to the regulatory regime could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid. One such provision that began in 2013 imposed a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers. This provision was temporarily suspended through December 31, 2017, and recently suspended again through December 31, 2019 by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If this provision delaying the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, it may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold thereafter if not repealed. The Health Care Reform Law may also adversely affect payors by increasing their medical cost trends, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas, although the extent of this impact is currently unknown. Additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform are uncertain at this time, and the Health Care Reform Law may be invalidated, in whole or in part, or it may be repealed. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nCompliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions, including fines or penalties, injunctions and/or criminal or other civil proceedings. Any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDentsply Sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances.\nDentsply Sirona must obtain certain approvals by, and marketing clearances from, governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products in those countries. These agencies regulate the marketing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and distribution of medical devices. The FDA enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products are currently regulated by such authorities and certain of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s new products will require approval by, or marketing clearance from, various governmental authorities, including the FDA. Various states also impose similar regulations.\nThe FDA review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. A 510(k) application is required in order to market a new or modified medical device. If specifically required by the FDA, a pre-market approval, or PMA, may be necessary. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming. They may delay or hinder a product\u2019s timely entry into the marketplace. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the FDA or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion, if at all, or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us. The FDA also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received FDA clearance. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.\nSimilar to the FDA review process, the EU review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product\u2019s entry into the marketplace.\nFailure to comply with these rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business. Also, these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require Dentsply Sirona to make changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.\nChallenges may be asserted against the Company\u2019s products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues.\nThe Company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products. While the Company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective, there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality, health or environmental impact of the Company\u2019s products or certain raw material components of the Company\u2019s products. All dental amalgam filling materials, including those manufactured and sold by Dentsply Sirona, contain mercury. Some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content and/or that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment. In the United States, the EPA proposed in September 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act to help cut discharges of mercury-containing dental amalgam to the environment. The rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology (amalgam separators) and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publicly-owned treatment works. Similar regulations exist in Europe and in February 2016, the European Union adopted a ratification package regarding the United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury, proposing rules restricting the use of dental amalgam to the encapsulated form and requiring the use of separators by dentists. If governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale and/or disposal of dental amalgam, that could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales of dental amalgam. Dentsply Sirona also manufactures and sells non-amalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenol-A, commonly called BPA. BPA is found in many everyday items, such as plastic bottles, foods, detergents and toys, and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a by-product of other ingredients that have degraded, or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants. The FDA currently allows the use of BPA in dental materials, medical devices, and food packaging. Nevertheless, public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of BPA could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the Company\u2019s products that contain mercury or BPA. Adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products, whether or not ultimately based on fact, may have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation and/or product limitations or discontinuation.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event.\nThe Company operates in more than 120 countries and its and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the Company\u2019s business and consolidated results of operations. Any insurance maintained by the Company may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions, and our emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future.", "PERMNO": 11600, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "XRAY"}
