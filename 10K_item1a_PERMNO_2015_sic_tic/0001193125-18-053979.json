Risk Factors\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our CA Business\nWe are dependent on agreements with our airline partners to be able to access passengers. Payments for our passenger services have provided, and will continue to provide, a significant portion of our revenue. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis or to renew any existing agreements upon expiration or termination may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had our equipment installed and provided our Gogo service to passengers on aircraft operated by 14 airlines and we had definitive contracts with four additional airlines. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Gogo service we provide to passengers on commercial aircraft generated approximately 63%, 64% and 63% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Our ability to meet our commitments to certain of our customers requires us to reach agreements with OEMs, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. Our growth is dependent on our ability to have our equipment installed on additional aircraft and increase passenger use of the Gogo service on installed aircraft. Any delays in installations under these contracts may negatively affect our relationships with airline partners and our ability to maintain or grow our passenger user base and revenue, as may unavailability or degradation of our service resulting from the failure of our equipment or software or other factors. In addition, we have no assurance that any of our current airline partners will renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration, or that they will not terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events. Contractual termination events include our bankruptcy and our material breach of contract, which in certain contracts is defined to include material breach of our service level agreements, and/or failure to achieve certain certification, equipment delivery, installation or other milestones within agreed-upon time frames. Several contracts with airline partners permit such airline to terminate the contract if the percentage of passengers using connectivity on such airline\u2019s flights falls below certain negotiated thresholds. One contract with an airline partner from which we derive a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our CA-NA segment revenue permits such airline partner to terminate its contract with us if the airline\u2019s revenue share falls below certain thresholds and Gogo elects to not make the airline whole for such revenue share shortfall. Contracts with our airline partners from which we derive a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our CA-NA segment revenue allow those airlines to terminate a portion or all of their respective agreements after a\nspecified time period, under some such contracts upon the payment of a termination fee and under other contracts with no fee required. Additionally, our contracts with American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and certain other airline partners, from which we derive a majority of our CA-NA segment revenue, permit such airline partners to terminate all or a portion of their contracts if another company provides a connectivity service that is a material improvement over our service, such that failing to adopt such alternative service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Under the Unified Agreement with American Airlines, the airline has the option to terminate our service, and we expect it to exercise such option, on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG/ATG-4 service is provided. We expect more than 400 such aircraft to be deinstalled in 2018 and early 2019. To the extent that our airline partners terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of our contracts with our airline partners include provisions that, under certain circumstances, entitle our airline partners to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other airline partners\u2019 connectivity agreements, including terms related to termination, maintenance, service and equipment and bandwidth pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. In addition, our inability to identify and offer improved terms to an airline partner in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that airline partner or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such connectivity agreement.\nA failure to maintain airline and passenger satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur relationships with our airline partners are critical to the growth and success of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, use of the Gogo service on Delta Air Lines aircraft accounted for approximately 26%, 27% and 28%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, use of the Gogo service on American Airlines aircraft accounted for approximately 21%, 23% and 22%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. If our airline partners are not satisfied with our equipment or the Gogo service for any reason, they may reduce efforts to co-market the Gogo service to their passengers, which together with passenger dissatisfaction could result in lower passenger usage and reduced revenue. In addition, airline dissatisfaction with us for any reason, including delays in obtaining certification for or installation of our equipment, failure of our system to meet specifications, or our failure to comply with our service level obligations, negatively affect our relationship with the airline partner and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights.\nWe are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe success of our CA business depends on our ability to provide adequate bandwidth to meet customer demands. The capacity of our ATG network is limited by the spectrum licensed and we are currently experiencing capacity constraints in the United States, particularly on certain flights where demand for our service is high and certain routes on which multiple aircraft are within range of the same cell site at one time. We may also experience capacity constraints internationally. We expect demand to continue to increase in CA-NA and CA-ROW as passenger adoption increases, bandwidth requirements per user grow and our service becomes available on more aircraft.\nOur plan to alleviate such constraints consists of: (i) continued installation of 2Ku on aircraft flying routes in the United States, including aircraft on which our existing ATG systems will be upgraded; (ii) successful\ndevelopment and deployment of ATG-NG; (iii) purchasing and employing capacity from a variety of satellites; and; (iv) continued use of bandwidth management tools. The successful execution of this plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in this Risk Factors section under the headings \u201c-We may be unsuccessful or delayed in widely deploying and operating our 2Ku technology,\u201d \u201c-We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next-generation ATG technology,\u201d and \u201c-We face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity.\u201d\nIn February 2015, the FCC reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services and adopted broad new net neutrality rules that depending on their interpretation could have constrained our ability to manage our networks. In December 2017, the FCC voted to partially repeal the February 2015 order, classifying broadband Internet access services once again as Title I information services and eliminating virtually all of the then-existing net neutrality obligations applicable to us. Members of Congress have proposed legislation to overturn the FCC\u2019s recent decision and the outcome of such proposal or other attempts to undo the decision cannot be predicted. If the net neutrality rules were to be reinstated, they could constrain our ability to manage our network and make it more difficult for us to meet capacity demands.\nThere can be no assurance that the actions we are taking will be sufficient to provide enough capacity in the United States or internationally. In addition, our ability to meet capacity demands depends in part on the willingness of airline customers to agree to install or upgrade to 2Ku and ATG-NG. If we fail to meet capacity demands, it could negatively affect our relationship with the airline partner and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights, and our business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which is itself affected by factors beyond the airlines\u2019 control. The airline industry is highly competitive and sensitive to changing economic conditions.\nOur business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial aircraft, the financial condition of the airlines and other economic factors. If consumer demand for air travel declines, including due to increased use of technology such as videoconferencing for business travelers, or the number of aircraft and flights shrinks due to, among other reasons, reductions in capacity by airlines, the number of passengers available to use the Gogo service will be reduced, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions and other events that are beyond the airlines\u2019 control, including higher unemployment rates, higher interest rates, reduced stock prices, reduced consumer and business spending, outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist attacks or threats could have a material adverse effect on the airline industry. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending could result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in airline flights offered and the number of passengers flying. Consolidation within the airline industry could also adversely affect our relationships with our existing airline partners or lead to Gogo-equipped aircraft being taken out of service.\nFurther, unfavorable economic conditions could also limit airlines\u2019 ability to counteract increased fuel, labor or other costs though raised prices. Our airline partners operate in a highly competitive business market and, as a result, continue to face pressure on offerings and pricing. These unfavorable conditions and the competitiveness of the air travel industry could cause one or more of our airline partners to reduce expenditures on passenger services including deployment of the Gogo service or to file for bankruptcy. If one or more of our airline partners were to file for bankruptcy, bankruptcy laws could give them rights to terminate their contracts with us, they could reduce their total fleet size and capacity and/or their total number of flights, and/or they could attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts with us including the pricing of our equipment and services. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the satellite capacity required to provide our Ku and 2Ku services and currently have agreements with several satellite partners to provide Ku-band satellite service on a non-exclusive basis. Service is typically provided through individual service orders for specified transponders, which range in duration from one to ten years. If any of these agreements were terminated or not renewed upon expiration, or if any of our satellite partners fail to obtain, or lose, necessary regulatory authorizations, we could face material delays or interruptions in the provision of service to our customers that rely on satellite service for connectivity or other services and we may not be able to find alternative satellite partners on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Certain of our agreements with satellite service providers commit us to purchase bandwidth up to ten years in advance, which may be inadequate to meet capacity demands or may exceed passenger demand and require us to incur unnecessary costs. See \u201c-We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nThe usefulness of the satellites upon which we currently rely and may rely on in the future is limited by each satellite\u2019s minimum design life. For example, the satellites through which we provide Ku-band service have minimum design lives ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our ability to offer inflight connectivity outside North America and alleviate capacity constraints throughout our network depends on the continued operation of the satellites or any replacement satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of those or future satellites, which may be shorter than their design lives, nor can we provide assurance that replacement satellites will be developed, authorized or successfully deployed.\nIn the event of a failure or loss of any of these satellites, our satellite service providers may relocate another satellite and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation may require regulatory approval, including through, among other things, a showing that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that our satellite service providers could obtain such regulatory approval. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for use as a replacement for a failed or lost satellite, or that such relocation can be accomplished without disrupting or otherwise adversely impacting our business.\nCertain satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service have not yet been launched. Satellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and to obtain other launch opportunities. Construction and launch delays, including any delay in the launch of satellites intended to replace one of the satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow our business with current airline partners or successfully negotiate agreements with airlines to which we do not currently provide the Gogo service; the effect of shifts in business models on our revenue and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe are currently in negotiations or discussions with certain of our airline partners to provide our equipment and the Gogo service on additional aircraft in their fleets. We have no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We are also in discussions with other airlines to provide our equipment and the Gogo service to some or all of their aircraft. Negotiations with current and prospective airline partners require substantial time, effort and resources. The time required to reach a final agreement with an airline is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations and any such failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and\nresources, actual costs incurred in the negotiation process and opportunity costs. In addition, the terms of any future agreements could be materially different and less favorable to us than the terms included in our existing agreements with our airline partners, which could trigger most favored nations provisions of contracts with certain existing airline partners, which could result in our inability to achieve the originally anticipated benefits of such contracts. While our turnkey model, under which we provide the connectivity service, determines passenger pricing and share revenue with the airline, has accounted for more than 90% of our CA service revenue in each fiscal period including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, several of our airline partners have adopted or have the option to adopt the airline-directed model, under which the airlines purchase bandwidth from us and distributes it to their passengers on a paid or complimentary basis. Under the airline-directed model, the airline retains pricing discretion over the cost of our service to passengers and the extent to which we receive revenue under this model is directly related to passenger usage. As a result, a failure by the airline to price our service appropriately would adversely affect our results. We expect commercial models and contract terms to continue to evolve, and we anticipate that third-party payors (including airlines) will generate an increasing portion of our revenue and that the portion of our revenue paid by passengers using our service will decline. We are unable to predict to what extent the airline-directed model will be adopted or to what extent future shifts in commercial models will occur or the net effect that implementing the airline-directed model or such shifts in models will have on our results of operations. In addition, our growth will depend in part on our ability to reach agreements with OEMs, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. To the extent that any negotiations with current or potential airline partners are unsuccessful, or any existing or future agreements reflecting evolving business models prove generally less favorable to us than expected or as compared to agreements under previously existing models, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and harm our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition from providers of satellite-based broadband connectivity and inflight entertainment services. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations, have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources and may be better able to withstand the effects of pricing pressures or periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers, including services we do not currently provide and/or may not provide in the future. With respect to our ATG services, while we are currently the only provider of ATG service in North America, a competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available in 2018 using the same unlicensed spectrum that we are using for ATG-NG, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum. Internationally, one of our competitors is building a hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide broadband service over Europe that may become available in 2018.\nWith respect to our satellite services, the increased availability, development and adoption of satellite-based services by commercial airlines around the world has and will continue to put additional pressure on our ability to maintain our market position, and we expect our market position to decline as our competitors install more aircraft with their satellite-based systems in the U.S. and internationally. Two of our competitors are satellite owners and operators and it is possible that other satellite providers will enter the market and sell bandwidth directly to airlines. Due to their different business model, such competitors may be able to provide equipment and services at prices more competitive than ours or offer services we do not provide. We believe that the principal points of competition in CA are technological capabilities, geographic coverage, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support and timeliness, and increasingly, the availability of factory installation. Airlines\u2019 desire for supplier diversification is also a factor in selection of connectivity providers, and if existing airline partners determine to award Gogo-installed or new aircraft to competitors, our ability to maintain or gain market position could be adversely affected.\nMaintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Increased competition for\nairline partners and aircraft or other market forces could force us to lower the prices we charge airlines for equipment and service or lose market share and could adversely affect our growth prospects and profitability. In addition, to the extent that competing in-flight connectivity or entertainment services offered by commercial airlines that are not our airline partners are available on more aircraft or offer improved quality or reliability as compared to the Gogo service, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Competition among airlines with respect to the pricing of passenger services, as well as passengers\u2019 expectations regarding pricing, may limit our ability to increase the price of our services under the turnkey model. Competition could increase our sales and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to effectively respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face limitations on our ability to grow our domestic operations which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur addressable market and our ability to expand domestically are limited by factors that include limitations on the number of U.S. commercial airlines with which we could partner, the number of planes in which our equipment can be installed, the passenger capacity within each plane, the ability of our network infrastructure or bandwidth to accommodate increasing capacity demands and our ability to successfully implement our technology roadmap on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our growth may slow, or we may stop growing altogether, to the extent that we have exhausted all potential airline partners and as we approach installation on full fleets and maximum penetration rates for passenger connectivity service on all flights. In such circumstances, to continue to grow our domestic revenue, we would have to rely on customer and airline partner adoption of other currently available and new or developing services and additional offerings, including Gogo Vision, Gogo TV, and CAS. We may not be able to profitably expand our domestic operations and if we fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur CA-ROW business has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance, and we may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally.\nWe began our CA-ROW business in the first quarter of 2014, and its limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the CA-ROW business and predict its future performance. The growth of our CA-NA segment since inception is not necessarily indicative of the future growth of CA-ROW. Any assessments of our current business and predictions that we or you make about the future financial and operating performance of CA-ROW or its effect on our consolidated financial and operating performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history in that segment. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability in CA-ROW involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, limitations on such investment under the indenture governing our senior secured notes and economic and financial market conditions. Further, our expansion plans require significant management attention and resources and our CA business has limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets as compared to North American markets, or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. Certain of our competitors, including current providers of satellite service, have more experience than we do in the international commercial airline connectivity and inflight entertainment markets. As a result, such competitors may have pre-existing relationships with international airlines and more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions or may already offer their equipment as standard, line-fit options on aircraft types, which may negatively affect our ability to enter into agreements with new international airline partners. As we expand our international business we expect to incur increased expenses related to establishing facilities and hiring employees in certain foreign locations and expanding international marketing and advertising efforts. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets, and we may be unable to enter into agreements on satisfactory terms to provide connectivity services to international fleets of our existing North American airline partners and to new international airline partners. In addition, our ability to expand will be\nlimited by the demand for inflight broadband Internet access in international markets. Any failure to compete successfully in international markets could also negatively impact our reputation and domestic operations.\nOur current and future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory restrictions, including communications, privacy, censorship, aerospace and liability standards, intellectual property laws and enforcement practices, as well as United States and foreign export and import controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers and imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d);\n\u2022\ninability to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the (U.K.) Bribery Act 2010 and other similar anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and related risks, which risks could be increased by our interaction with employees of certain foreign government-owned airlines who are deemed \u201cgovernment officials\u201d under the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to grow our business internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our business, future operating results and financial condition. Our failure to successfully grow our business internationally or comply with laws and regulations to which we become subject as a result of doing business internationally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in widely deploying and operating our 2Ku technology.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had more than 550 2Ku systems installed and more than 1,400 aircraft awarded, but not yet installed. There can be no assurance that we can meet our installation goals on our current timeline, due to risks that include the failure of 2Ku-related equipment and software to perform as expected during testing or following installation, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source and other suppliers to provide certain components and services, and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. We have encountered delays and quality problems as we deploy 2Ku, which we are in the process of remediating, and may continue to do so given the aggressive installation schedule that we are undertaking and the demands that the schedule places on employees, suppliers and other resources.\nIn addition, other providers of satellite-based connectivity services currently have services available for commercial deployment that are intended to compete directly with 2Ku, and airlines may choose to adopt such a service over 2Ku. Fifteen domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation on all or a portion of their fleets. The failure of 2Ku to perform as expected, or significant delays in our ability to install 2Ku systems, could result in material breaches of such agreements which could in turn result in the imposition of penalties, claims by airlines for damages or termination of such agreements.\nIf 2Ku fails to perform as expected or we fail to meet the installation timelines and performance metrics for which we have contracted, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nadversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver 2Ku could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See \u201c-We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our ATG-NG technology.\nWe expect our ATG-NG solution, which will offer additional bandwidth and improved speeds for our connectivity service as compared to existing ATG technologies, to become available to commercial aircraft in 2018. There can be no assurance that we can meet our development goals on our current timeline, due to, among other things, risks associated with integrating the use of licensed and unlicensed spectrum, utilizing the unlicensed spectrum to perform as we expect, the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source and other suppliers to provide certain components and services and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If our ATG-NG fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines for which we contract, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver ATG-NG could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See also \u201c-We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nWe may be unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from Gogo Vision, our inflight platform, Gogo TV, CAS and other services that we may offer in the future.\nThe future growth prospects for our CA business depend, in part, on airlines or passengers paying for Gogo Vision on-demand video services, Gogo TV, CAS and new products and services that we develop in response to airline and passenger needs. Our ability to generate revenue from such services depends on:\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our services on new airlines and more aircraft and increase passenger adoption;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain content (including digital rights to such content) from third parties for Gogo TV, Gogo Vision and new entertainment services;\n\u2022\nour ability to customize and improve services in response to trends and customer interests;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new services;\n\u2022\nour ability to monetize existing and new services;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which and pace at which airlines and other companies in the aviation industry adopt and utilize operational applications; and\n\u2022\nour ability to partner with third parties to develop and implement operational applications that are compatible with our networks.\nIf we are unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from these services and our inflight platform, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nA future act or threat of terrorism, cyber-attack or other event could result in reduced demand for our products and services or result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft.\nA future act of terrorism or cyber-attack on an aircraft, the threat of such acts or unrelated airline accidents could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In such event, our industry may experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government or foreign governments could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft, which would eliminate demand for our products and services. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or service and the threat of terrorism, cyber-attacks or accidents involving aircraft on which our systems operate would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services. Such reduced demand for our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAir traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes, the outbreak of disease or any other similar event could harm the airline industry.\nAirlines are subject to cancellations or delays due to weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems, including work stoppages or reduced government funding, breaches in security, outbreaks of communicable diseases or other factors. Such cancellations or delays could reduce the number of passengers on commercial flights, reduce demand for our products and services and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our BA Business\nEquipment sales to OEMs and after-market dealers account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings in the BA segment, and the loss of an OEM or dealer customer could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nRevenue from equipment sales on contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers accounted for approximately 28% of the revenue generated by our BA segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and more than 30% of BA revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Almost all of BA\u2019s contracts with OEM and dealer customers are terminable at will by either party. If a key OEM or dealer terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur OEM customers may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, our customers may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEM customers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations.\nOur BA equipment and service are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors:\n\u2022\ndevelop equipment or service that is superior to our equipment and service;\n\u2022\ndevelop equipment or service that is priced more competitively than our equipment and service;\n\u2022\ndevelop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing equipment and services; or\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our BA segment are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available in 2018 using the same unlicensed spectrum that we are using for ATG-NG, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum.\nWe generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our equipment. Further, we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, so we take the risk for cost overruns.\nMany of our OEM customers may terminate their contracts with us on short notice and, in many cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our equipment. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, the historical purchasing patterns of customers, and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM customers, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product.\nMany of the risks that could harm our CA business could also adversely affect our BA business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales of ATG equipment accounted for more than 60% of equipment revenue, and subscriptions for our Gogo Biz inflight broadband Internet service accounted for more than 85% of service revenue for our BA segment. Accordingly, many of the risks described above relating to our CA business may also have a material adverse effect on our BA business, including expected capacity constraints on our network in the near-term and our ability to manage those constraints, our ability to successfully develop and implement ATG-NG, our ability to successfully implement technology enhancements to our network and our ability to successfully develop and deploy new products and services and generate revenue and profits from the sale of such products and services.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation\nOur CA-NA and BA businesses are dependent on the availability of spectrum.\nIn June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of Airfone, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon\nexpiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revises the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026.\nOur ability to offer inflight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing capacity demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3MHz spectrum.\nWhile we are the exclusive licensee of the only United States spectrum dedicated to ATG connectivity, additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the United States or internationally in the future.\nWhile we have exclusive rights to the only spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider of ATG service in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity.\nThe availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is developing and intends to launch in 2018 an ATG network using the same unlicensed spectrum that we will employ in ATG-NG.\nWhile competition in CA-ROW currently consists of satellite-based connectivity services, discussions are occurring in the European Union and elsewhere regarding the use of spectrum for ATG service and one such competitor is building a European hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide aviation customers connectivity service in Europe and has announced its intention to launch such service in 2018. As a result, we may face competition from such providers in such regions.\nIf we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license.\nUnder the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, or satellite failures.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our inflight portal, network infrastructure, content delivery processes and payment systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed down our portal\u2019s performance and users\u2019 access to the Internet, or made our portal inaccessible, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures in the future, which may be due to factors beyond our control. In the past, failures resulting in users not being able to access the service have often been remedied by bypassing the payment processing step for users and directly connecting such users to the Internet, leading to a loss of revenue for those sessions. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, we may lose revenue to the extent that we have to bypass the payment processing step in order to maintain users\u2019 connectivity to the Internet, and such failures could be material breaches of airline contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or airline claims for damages.\nOur operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. In addition, the satellites upon which we rely for current services and will rely for future services are and will be subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, which have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing defects, problems with the power or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space. Certain satellites on which we rely or will rely have limited or no operating history. Our satellite network currently includes high throughput satellites, which were first launched in 2017, and will include low earth orbit satellites, the first of which is expected to launch in 2020. Damage to our or third parties\u2019 networks could cause interruptions in the services that we provide. Such interruptions in our services could have a material adverse effect on service revenue, our reputation and our ability to attract or retain customers.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced and may face claims that we or a supplier or customer have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nMany companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. In addition, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As\na result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with our airline partners and certain BA customers, we have agreed to indemnify our airline partners and such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the aviation partner in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline partners terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, airlines and other aircraft operators.\nThe market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in aviation partner and passenger needs and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services for both passenger and aircraft operational use on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, aviation partner and passenger requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices and new operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create, or obtain rights to, cost effective solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, airline partners, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as \u201cGogo\u201d and \u201cGogo Vision\u201d and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future, including China and India. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to\nexploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology.\nOpen source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked to in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business.\nThe failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service.\nOur products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our inflight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our aviation partners may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify most of our airline partners for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected.\nRegulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services.\nWe are subject to various regulations, including those regulations promulgated by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies and comparable agencies outside the United States where we may do business. The two U.S. government agencies that have primary regulatory authority over our operations are the FCC and the FAA.\nThe FCC regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us and the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless telecommunications systems. Any breach of the terms\nof our ATG spectrum license or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us.\nThe commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated in the United States by the FAA. FAA certification is required for all equipment we install on commercial aircraft and type certificated business aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification as a parts manufacturer. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Licenses and Regulation-Federal Aviation Administration,\u201d FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAA\u2019s requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. Our failure to comply with FAA regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The FAA closely regulates many of our operations. If we fail to comply with the FAA\u2019s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase.\nWe are required to contribute a percentage of all revenue generated from interstate or international telecommunications services or interconnected VoIP services, which we offer in the BA segment to the federal Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Broadband Internet access services are currently exempt from these USF contribution requirements.\nAs a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA, or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations.\nWe are also subject to regulation by foreign laws and regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which our international airline partners are registered, as well as foreign government agencies that choose to assert jurisdiction over us as a result of the service we provide on aircraft that fly international routes, including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (formerly Industry Canada), which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Many of such jurisdictions impose assistance to law enforcement obligations similar to CALEA.\nAdverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could delay the deployment of our services and have other adverse consequences for us. Our ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals to offer the Gogo service internationally may also be the responsibility of our aviation partners or third parties, and therefore may be out of our control. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business.\nIf government regulation of the Internet, including e-commerce or online video distribution changes, we may need to change the way we conduct our business to a manner that incurs greater operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. We cannot be certain that we, our vendors and media partners or our aviation customers are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements in the countries in which our service is used. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of laws or regulations or the applicability of laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business to comply with existing or future legal or regulatory requirements may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, since June 12, 2015, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services have been classified as Title II telecommunications services subject to FCC common carrier regulation and broad net neutrality rules pursuant to the Open Internet Order, which prohibits broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contain an exception for \u201creasonable network management.\u201d The Open Internet Order recognizes that whether a network management practice is reasonable varies according to the broadband technology involved, and we believe it provides more flexibility to implement network management practices in the context of Gogo\u2019s capacity-constrained air-to-ground and satellite broadband networks. The Open Internet Order also imposes disclosure requirements on broadband providers, including more granular network performance reporting requirements. The FCC exempted smaller providers, such as Gogo, from its enhanced disclosure requirements until March 2022.\nHowever, on January 4, 2018, the FCC released the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which will repeal most of the Open Internet Order, reclassify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier \u201cinformation service,\u201d and remove virtually all of the compliance obligations that the Open Internet Order imposes on our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services. The Restoring Internet Freedom Order has not gone into effect as of this date, and it is expected to be subject to additional judicial and executive branch review. Under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may be subject to certain transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. Gogo continues to evaluate its obligations under the new rules.\nOther jurisdictions may adopt similar or different regulations that could affect our ability to use \u201cnetwork management\u201d techniques.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf our efforts to retain and attract passenger users are not successful, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Gogo service we provide to passengers on commercial aircraft generated approximately 63%, 64% and 63% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We\nmust continue to retain existing users and attract new users. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nUnreliable service levels, lack of sufficient capacity, the scope and nature of our service offerings, uncompetitive pricing, difficulty or delay in accessing our portal, lack of availability and cybersecurity and privacy risks are some of the factors that may adversely impact our ability to retain existing users and attract new and repeat users. If passengers are able to satisfy their inflight entertainment needs through activities other than broadband Internet access, at no or lower cost, they may not perceive value in our products and services. If our efforts to satisfy and retain our existing users are not successful, we may not be able to continue to attract new users through word-of-mouth referrals. Any of these factors could slow the growth of our service revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our contracts with airline partners from which we derive a majority of our CA business revenue allow for termination rights if the percentage of passengers using connectivity aboard their flights falls below certain thresholds.\nThe demand for inflight broadband Internet access service may decrease or develop more slowly than we expect. We cannot predict with certainty the development of the U.S. or international inflight broadband internet access market or the market acceptance for our products and services.\nOur future success depends upon growing demand for inflight broadband Internet access services, which is inherently uncertain. We have invested significant resources in the deployment of new systems and service offerings, which represent a substantial part of our growth strategy. We face the risk that the U.S. and international demand for inflight broadband Internet access services may decrease or develop more slowly or differently than we currently expect, or that our services, including our new offerings, may not achieve widespread market acceptance. We may be unable to market and sell our services successfully and cost-effectively to a sufficiently large number aviation partners.\nOur business depends on the continued proliferation of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in mobile devices. The growth in demand for inflight broadband Internet access services also depends in part on the continued and increased use of laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices and the rate of evolution of data-intensive applications on the mobile Internet. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in mobile devices, if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on mobile devices decreases or is slower than expected, or if the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices or development of related applications decreases or grows more slowly than anticipated, the market for our services may be substantially diminished.\nWe have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched the Gogo service and may continue to incur quarterly operating losses, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nWe have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched our CA service in August 2008, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue in the future to generate operating income. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on the continued roll-out of our technology roadmap and international expansion. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables and such initiatives may require funding beyond the funding we currently expect and/or the funding we can secure. See the disclosure elsewhere in this Risk Factors section under the heading \u201c- We may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all.\u201d Such variables include, for our technology roadmap, the availability of and costs associated with development and deployment of ATG-NG, the timely and successful installation of our equipment, and the timing of the deployment of other technologies in the future, as well as costs incurred to develop and implement changes to ground and airborne software and hardware, costs associated with subsidizing our airline partners\u2019 equipment purchases, including upgrades to ATG-4, 2Ku or other contractually obligated upgrades to our connectivity services and, with respect to satellite technologies, the cost of obtaining satellite capacity. With respect to our international expansion, additional variables may include costs incurred to modify\nour portal for international deployment, costs related to sales and marketing activities and administrative support functions, additional legal and regulatory expenses associated with operating in the international commercial aviation market, costs incurred to set up branch offices, subsidiaries or other entities required to do business in certain countries, costs incurred to set up physical foreign offices and employment related costs for individuals located in those countries. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and promote our brand internationally. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $409.1 million. However, we may require additional financing at some point in the future to fully execute our business plan, including our technology roadmap, international or domestic expansion plans or other changes. Our success may depend on our ability to raise such additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the resources required to complete our development of ATG-NG, the extent of deployment of 2Ku and ATG-NG service, the rate of customer penetration, the adoption of our service by airline partners and other factors set forth above that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, as amended. As of December 31, 2017, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $7.9 million of additional indebtedness. See \u201c-Risks Related to our Indebtedness-We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\u201d If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ unplanned internal cost savings measures.\nIncreased costs and other demands associated with our growth could impact our ability to achieve profitability and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources.\nWe expect our costs to increase in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. We continue to experience growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Such growth, as well as anticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our service offerings, the wide deployment of 2Ku, the development and implementation of ATG-NG and other components of the technology roadmap, and continued investment in CA-ROW, have required and will require the outlay of significant operating and capital expenditures and will continue to place strains on our personnel, technology and infrastructure. The pace of our 2Ku installation schedule has placed significant strain on our organization and we have encountered supply chain issues that include delays in delivering and installing our equipment and failure of such equipment to meet specifications upon delivery. These issues have been exacerbated due to issues encountered in our recent implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to contain these costs and other costs associated with growth opportunities. To successfully manage the expected growth of our operations on a timely and cost-effective basis we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management processes and controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate new employees and develop and motivate all employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate\nculture. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nU.S. federal tax reform could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, Congress enacted H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d). U.S. Tax Reform includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the U. S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction, such as a limitation on the deductibility of U.S. interest expense. U.S. Tax Reform also includes international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign source income of domestic multinational corporations. The Company\u2019s financial statement impacts include adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. While there are benefits, there is also substantial uncertainty regarding the details of U.S. Tax Reform. The intended and unintended consequences of U.S. Tax Reform on our business are uncertain and could be adverse. We will continue to assess the effect of U.S. Tax Reform on our business as it relates to the disallowance of interest expense deductions, taxes on low taxed intangible foreign income as well as deductions for foreign derived intangible income and deductions for executive compensation.\nAdverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMacro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the airline industry. For many travelers, air travel and spending on inflight Internet access are discretionary purchases that they can eliminate in difficult economic times. Additionally, a weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in overall business travel, which has historically been an important contributor to our service revenue, or cause BA owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate unpredictably and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price.\nWe operate in a dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, due to generally lower demand for business travel during the summer months and holiday periods, and leisure and other travel at other times during the year, our quarterly results may not be indicative of results for the full year. Due to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of credit cards by users of our services present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees and credit card information. The\nsecure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and payment processing services, and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information and credit card information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with airline partners, which generally require us to indemnify the airline for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also must comply with certain Communications Act privacy and data security requirements for our voice and broadband Internet access services, and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. After the FCC\u2019s Restoring Internet Freedom Order goes into effect, our broadband Internet access service will no longer be subject to the privacy and data security requirements of the Communications Act. However, under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may still be subject to certain transparency obligations for its broadband Internet access service that require disclosure of its privacy practices. Gogo continues to evaluate its obligations under the new rules.\nOther countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union, also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries\u2019 laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations may become more complex. On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the GDPR, scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which has resulted in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Our compliance with GDPR will require substantial preparation and expenditures, and there can be no assurance that we will be in compliant by the effective date. Our failure to comply with GDPR and other countries\u2019 privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under\nour airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, substantially all connectivity customers use credit cards to purchase our products and services. Problems with our or our vendors\u2019 billing software could adversely affect our customer satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services. If our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our subscribers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by major credit card companies, to comply with their data security standards to protect payment card information. New and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.\nWe depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our ATG and satellite services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems, the radomes for our satellite systems and the equipment used at our ATG and ATG-NG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers\u2019 ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. The single-source provider from which we historically purchased modems for our ATG and ATG-4 systems recently determined to stop manufacturing such modems. We intend to transition to a new mobile network technology but need a supply of modems compatible with the existing technology until the transition occurs. We have contracted with a supplier of certain other critical components of our system to provide such modems and such supplier has licensed the requisite intellectual property from the previous supplier. Due to the necessity of certain design changes and other factors, there can be no assurance that modems supplied by the new provider will be delivered adequate to meet our needs. We also rely on a third party to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn our CA business, installation and maintenance of our airborne ATG and satellite equipment is performed by employees of third-party service providers with whom we contract, and in some cases, our airline partners can elect to have their own employees or a third-party service provider of their choice install our equipment. In our BA segment, installation of our equipment is performed by the OEMs or dealers who purchase our equipment. Having third parties or our customers install or maintain our equipment reduces our control over the processes, including timeliness and quality. If there is an equipment failure, including due to problems with the installation or maintenance processes, our reputation and our relationships with our customers could be harmed. The passenger jets operated by our airline partners are very costly to repair and therefore damages for claims related to faulty installation or maintenance could be material. Additionally, we may be forced to pay significant remediation costs and/or penalties to airlines to cover equipment failure due to installation or maintenance problems and we may not be able to be indemnified for these costs.\nThe supply of third party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur agreements with our equipment and service providers may contain terms, such as those related to termination, pricing and service levels and related penalties, that are not consistent with our obligations under our agreements with customers that rely on such equipment for connectivity. Such misalignment could cause us to be in breach of such customer agreements, and we may be unable to seek indemnification for such losses from our providers. Further, if our suppliers were to increase their prices and we could not pass these increased costs on to our customers, it would increase our cost of service revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG and satellite networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. In particular, we may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Michael Small, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusinesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our organic or internal growth. We do not have any meaningful experience with integrating and managing acquired businesses or assets. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Moreover, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any future acquisition could involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nuse of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited market experience in new businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\ncontrols in the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\ndilution to our current stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review, or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions.\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe provision of equipment to our airline partners results in significant accounts receivable. In 2017, a significant majority of the service revenue in CA was generated from passenger credit card transactions resulting in credit card accounts receivable, which are typically settled within one to three business days following the charge. Going forward, we expect an increasing portion of our CA services revenue to be billed directly to airline partners operating under the airline-directed model and to third-party distributors of our service. Service and equipment revenues in our BA segment are directly billed to customers. We may not be able to collect our receivables on a timely basis. Difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, as well as longer payment cycles, could lead to material fluctuations in our cash flows, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters and class action lawsuits. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any airline partner, customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential airline partners, customers and suppliers.\nOur implementation of a new revenue recognition standard in 2018 (ASC 606) has required substantial preparation, and our failure to properly implement this standard in a timely manner could result in inaccurate revenue recognition and disclosure and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued new revenue recognition guidance under ASC 606, which is effective for our interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Under this new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is being recognized. Implementation of ASC 606 has required and will continue to require additional investments, and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods. If we are not able to properly implement ASC 606 in a timely manner, the revenue that we recognize and the related disclosures that we provide under ASC 606 may not be accurately reported.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, including $690.0 million outstanding of our 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) and $361.9 million outstanding of our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, as amended, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding notes may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuance of Convertible Notes and issuance of Senior Secured Notes. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $8 million. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes does not prohibit Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances. However, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or to pay interest on indebtedness incurred, or dividends on preferred stock issued by us with maturities later than July 1, 2022, or issued by us to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes.\nThe terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur\nand to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness.\nWe cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions or, if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations, including amounts under the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, when due.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries\u2019 unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes, to repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the Convertible Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or upon Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may distribute to us to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or any interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support.\nOur failure to purchase Convertible Notes required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent.\nThe change of control repurchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase.\nThe Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through February 9, 2018, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $7.86 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include:\n\u2022\nairline industry or general market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services;\n\u2022\nany inability to timely and efficiently roll out 2Ku, 2.4 GHz or other components of our technology roadmap;\n\u2022\nany inability to sufficiently execute our international growth strategy;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain satellite service on commercially reasonable terms or at all, currently and in the future;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;\n\u2022\nfailure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nrenewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjustments by holders of the Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAny buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity which we expect to occur involving our common stock.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transactions (the \u201cForward Transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions (the \u201cForward Counterparties\u201d). The Forward Transactions are generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparties and investors in the Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Forward Transactions is on or around March 1, 2020, the maturity date for the Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Forward Transactions, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Forward Transactions than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Forward Transactions. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing of our convertible bonds, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the Forward Counterparties (or their respective affiliates) are likely to modify their hedge positions in respect of the Forward Transactions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions\nwith respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Forward Transactions (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Forward Transactions and on or around any election by a Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of its Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe Forward Counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Forward Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity incentives and the conversion of Convertible Notes. We may reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analysts covering Gogo downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur significant stockholder could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Oakleigh Thorne and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (\u201cThorne Entities\u201d) beneficially own approximately 29% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, the Thorne Entities will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions, which may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe interests of the Thorne Entities may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director\u2019s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nAs a public company, Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as Nasdaq rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nWe are required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or the implementation of our financial system upgrade, may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nEstablishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nA requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nA provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nA limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nA prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nA requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and growth of our business, and we do not expect to declare and pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, to the extent that we determine to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nOur corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our board of directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens.\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, \u201c-Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation-If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license.\u201d Our corporate charter and\nbylaws include provisions that permit our board of directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock.\nThese restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex.\nWe are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.", "PERMNO": 13956, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GOGO"}
