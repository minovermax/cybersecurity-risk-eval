RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and poses risks to, our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our business, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. While we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies, the public health situation, global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook. Accordingly, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and taking steps to mitigate its risks by working with our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Significant portions of our workforce and operations have been impacted by quarantines, government orders and guidance, facility closures, illness, travel restrictions, implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions. Over the course of the pandemic, we have continued to operate in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program. More specifically, we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network with respect to social distancing, physical separation, personal protective equipment and sanitization, and have restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time. Further actions may be required as conditions evolve, including if new waves of infection emerge in various parts of the globe or until a vaccine is widely available. In addition, because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in many of our end-markets, some of our businesses have continued to operate at reduced capacity. We cannot predict the number or timing of any future facility closures, the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand, illness, quarantine, travel restrictions or financial hardship. We have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production of our products, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders and purchases and our collections of accounts receivable, which may be material, and the extent of these adverse impacts on future operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders and purchases and our collections remains uncertain even if conditions begin to improve.\nFurthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the unprecedented and sustained social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, there is uncertainty around its duration and the timing of recovery. The ultimate significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any measures to reduce its spread, on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater impact on revenue from international markets compared to the United States, resulting in a greater rate of decline. As a result, approximately 45% of our revenues for 2020 as compared to approximately 47% in 2019 were derived outside the United States. This was mostly in Europe and China.\nWe will continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:\no political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\no government import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;\no the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;\no limitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;\no transportation delays and interruptions;\no labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\no widespread public health crises, such as a pandemic or epidemic;\no increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;\no the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;\no difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\no limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\no potentially adverse tax consequences; and\no access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\u2022Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nWe depend on our own and third party IT systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use our third party IT systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. Increasingly, our customers, including government customers, are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products. Our business has both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information\ngenerally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds.\nThese trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. Not withstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to, cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. In addition, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.\n\u2022Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nWe may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.\nOur businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndustry Risks\n\u2022Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.\nOur competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, evolving regulations, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors\u2019 developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.\n\u2022Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.\nThe success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies, to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\n\u2022We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.\nWe purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations. Factors such as freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials, sub-assemblies and components. Significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor\u2019s pricing pressure or other factors.\nWe use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future. In addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. If a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials or a shortage in or the unavailability of raw materials or components may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022Our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.\nOur businesses\u2019 domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). These laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. In addition, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union common market and the terms of the UK EU Trade and Cooperation agreement may impact our market access and pricing, compliance with regulatory requirements and ability to hire and maintain personnel. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position.\nCertain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.\nFinancial and Strategic Risks\n\u2022Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Swedish krona, Pound Sterling, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses\u2019 operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and\nU.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.\n\u2022Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.\nWe expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022If the Apergy spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the spin-off of Apergy, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS Ruling\") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Apergy, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we and Apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.\nIf the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Apergy common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.\n\u2022The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or\nthrough indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters.\nIn connection with the spin-off, Apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Apergy business. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLabor and Employment Risks\n\u2022Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 25953, "SIC": 3585, "TIC": "DOV"}
