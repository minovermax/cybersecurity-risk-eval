{"cik": "916907", "company": "SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-09-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operating Environment\nAn investment in our securities is subject to inherent risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition activities.\nThe success of our acquisition activities depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of the companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the companies or result in decreased revenues from customers. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to ensure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u00b7\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u00b7\nin the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral;\n\u00b7\nthe credit history of a particular borrower;\n\u00b7\nchanges in economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe duration of the loan.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses which we believe is appropriate to provide for potential losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe quality, size and diversity of the loan portfolio;\n\u00b7\nevaluation of non-performing loans;\n\u00b7\nhistorical default and loss experience;\n\u00b7\nhistorical recovery experience;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions;\n\u00b7\nrisk characteristics of the various classifications of loans; and\n\u00b7\nthe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nIf loan losses exceed the allowance for loan losses, our business, financial condition and profitability may suffer.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, our nonperforming assets were $13.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, or 0.69% and 0.37% of total assets, respectively. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u00b7\nWe do not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans, nonperforming investment securities, or other real estate owned.\n\u00b7\nWe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses.\n\u00b7\nNon-interest expense increases when we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other-than-temporary impairment on nonperforming investment securities.\n\u00b7\nThere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to our other real estate owned.\n\u00b7\nThe resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can divert management's attention from more profitable activities.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in economic conditions, particularly an economic slowdown in southern Missouri or northern Arkansas, could hurt our business.\nOur business is directly affected by market conditions, trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. The housing and real estate sectors have recovered since the 2008 economic slowdown and are currently expanding. However, future deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within our primary market area in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, could result in the following consequences, among others, any of which could hurt our business materially:\n\u00b7\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u00b7\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u00b7\nloan collateral may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of collateral securing our loans; and\n\u00b7\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nDownturns in the real estate markets in our primary market area could hurt our business.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are primarily concentrated in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas. While we did not and do not have a sub-prime lending program, our residential real estate, construction and land loan portfolios, our commercial and multi-family loan portfolios and certain of our other loans could be affected by the downturn in the residential real estate market. We anticipate that significant declines in the real estate markets in our primary market area would hurt our business and would mean that collateral for our loans would hold less value. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The events and conditions described in this risk factor could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur construction lending exposes us to significant risk.\nOur construction loan portfolio, which totaled $112.7 million, or 7.21% of loans, net, at June 30, 2018, includes residential and non-residential construction and development loans. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and sale, leasing, or operation of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are often more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy than other real estate loans. These loans are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Additionally, we may experience significant construction loan losses because independent appraisers or project engineers inaccurately estimate the cost and value of construction loan projects.\nDeterioration in our construction portfolio could result in increases in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our percentage of commercial real estate and commercial business loans.\nAt June 30, 2018, 60.6% of our loans, net, consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans to small and mid-sized businesses, generally located in our primary market area, which are the types of businesses that have a heightened vulnerability to local economic conditions. Over the last ten years, we have increased this type of lending from 47.5% of our portfolio at June 30, 2008, in order to improve the yield on our assets. At June 30, 2018, our loan portfolio included $704.6 million of commercial real estate loans and $281.3 million of commercial business loans compared to $603.9 million and $247.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2017. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one- to four-family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower's business or the real estate securing the loans as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Additionally, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Commercial loans not collateralized by real estate are often secured by collateral that may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and fluctuate in value (such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment). If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSeveral of our commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or business loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to any one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer than for one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Since we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses due to the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any increase to our provision for loan losses would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Any delinquent payments or the failure to repay these loans would hurt our operating results and financial condition.\nIncluded in the commercial real estate loans described above are agricultural real estate loans totaling $160.3 million, or 10.3% of our loan portfolio, net, at June 30, 2018. Agricultural real estate lending involves a greater degree of risk and typically involves larger loans to single borrowers than lending on single-family residences. Payments on agricultural real estate loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loan. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the farm borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products (both domestically and internationally) and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary agricultural activity in our market areas is livestock, dairy, poultry, rice, timber, soybeans,\nwheat, melons, corn, and cotton. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these activities could have an adverse effect on our agricultural real estate loan portfolio. Our agricultural real estate lending has grown significantly since June 30, 2008, when these loans totaled $14.9 million, or 4.2% of our loan portfolio.\nIncluded in the commercial business loans described above are agricultural production and equipment loans. At June 30, 2018, these loans totaled $81.5 million, or 5.2%, of our loan portfolio, net. As with agricultural real estate loans, the repayment of operating loans is dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property. The same risk applies to agricultural operating loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops. Any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation to the collateral. Our agricultural operating loans have also grown significantly since June 30, 2008, when such loans totaled $22.7 million, or 6.4% of our loan portfolio.\nContinued growth of our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios may increase the risk of credit defaults in the future.\nDue to our increasing emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business lending, a substantial amount of the loans in our commercial real estate and commercial business portfolios and our lending relationships are of relatively recent origin. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as \"seasoning.\" A portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans naturally create portfolio \"churn\" as loans are originated and repaid. As a result, our portfolio consists of a mix of seasoned and unseasoned loans. We believe that our underwriting practices are sound and based on industry standards and best practices. However, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is relatively new, therefore, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned, which may be higher than current levels. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we approach thresholds defined in interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentrations, we may incur additional expense or slow the growth of certain categories of commercial real estate lending.\nThe federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending (see \"REGULATION\"). For the purposes of this guidance, \"commercial real estate\" includes, among other types, multi-family residential loans and non-owner occupied nonresidential loans, two categories which have been a source of loan growth for the Company. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: total loans for construction land development and other land representing 100% or more of the bank's total capital; or total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that exceed 300% of the bank's total capital and the bank's commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Bank exceeded the 300% threshold for non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans as a percentage of total regulatory capital for the first time at September 30, 2016, and remained above the threshold for most of fiscal 2017, before declining to 271% at June 30, 2017. The Bank's highest level during fiscal 2017 was 303% at December 31, 2016. The lower level at June 30, 2017, was the result of additional capital invested in the Bank by the Company following the June at-the-market common stock offering completed by the Company, and from additional capital resulting from the acquisition and merger of Tammcorp, Inc., and its bank subsidiary, Capaha Bank, with and into Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., while Capaha Bank held a lower percentage of its loans in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. During fiscal 2018, the Bank remained below the 300% threshold throughout the fiscal year, and reported total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) of 241% of the Bank's total capital at June 30, 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company's non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans peaked at 293% of total regulatory capital at December 31, 2016, before declining to 256% at June 30, 2017, with this decline also attributable to additional capital provided by the at-the-market common offering completed by the Company in June, as well as the Tammcorp, Inc., acquisition. During fiscal 2018, the Company also remained below the 300% threshold throughout the fiscal year, and reported total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) of 233% of the Company's total capital at June 30, 2018.\nThe Bank and Company may again see its non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending grow as a percentage of total regulatory capital, or it may slow the growth of this type of lending activity. Should we continue to grow this category of our loan portfolio, we may incur additional expense to meet the heightened supervisory expectations related to this lending activity. If we slow the growth of commercial real estate loans generally, or particular concentrations of borrowers or categories of properties within that definition, we may be negatively impacted in terms of our asset growth, net interest margin and earnings, leverage, or other targets.\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings and the value of our assets.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earnings assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or an adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally.\nWe have pursued a strategy of supplementing internal growth by acquiring other financial companies or their assets and liabilities that we believe will help fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, including the following:\n\u00b7\nWe may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected;\n\u00b7\nPrices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future;\n\u00b7\nThe acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into us to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, or at all, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u00b7\nTo the extent our costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired, the acquisition will generate goodwill. We are required to assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually, and any goodwill impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nTo finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders; and\n\u00b7\nWe have completed three acquisitions within the past five years and opened additional banking offices in the past few years that enhanced our rate of growth. We do not necessarily expect to be able to maintain our past rate of growth, and may not be able to grow at all in the future.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we anticipate that our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations or continued growth, both internally and through acquisitions. Any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock, or otherwise adversely affect your investment.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or if the terms will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact us or the businesses in which we are engaged.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds, and not to benefit our shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us and our shareholders.\nImpairment of investment securities, other intangible assets, or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn assessing the impairment of investment securities, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the securities has been less than the cost of the securities, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. In fiscal 2009, we incurred charges to recognize the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of available-for-sale investments related to investments in Freddie Mac preferred stock ($304,000 impairment realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009) and a pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligation, Trapeza CDO IV, Ltd., class C2 ($375,000 impairment realized in the second quarter of fiscal 2009). We currently hold two additional collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) which have not been deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, based on our best judgment using information currently available.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but, instead, are assessed for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present. As of June 30, 2018, we determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired.\nDeferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized. Should our management determine it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance with a charge to earnings would be reflected in the period. At June 30, 2018, our net deferred tax asset was $4.4 million, none of which was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. Based on the levels of taxable income in prior years and our expectation of profitability in the current year and future years, management has determined that no valuation allowance was required at June 30, 2018. If we are required in the future to take a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset, our financial condition, results of operations and regulatory capital levels would be negatively affected.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. We cannot assure you that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNon-compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. Several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations, some of which is expected to increase our costs of operations.\nWe are currently subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and the DFI and by the Federal Reserve. The FDIC, DFI and the Federal Reserve govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion, including the ability to restrict an institution's operations, require the institution to reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of the institution's allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or growth prospects. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nCertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a near term impact on us. For example, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Financial institutions, such as our subsidiary banks, with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.\nIt is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Any additional changes in our regulation and oversight, whether in the form of new laws, rules or regulations, could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to substantial liabilities.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. To date, we have grown our business successfully by focusing on our business lines in geographic markets and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by our customers. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, brokerage houses, mutual funds, insurance companies and specialized finance companies. Many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, and many have substantially greater resources and lending limits, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, and smaller newer competitors may also be more aggressive in terms of pricing loan and deposit products than we are in order to obtain a share of the market. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies, federally insured state-chartered banks, national banks and federal savings banks. As a result, these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and business.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could damage our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and business.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could damage our reputation and business.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cyber-security breaches.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, including privacy breaches and cyber attacks, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.\nThere have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial institutions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing requirements to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with those service providers, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nWe cannot predict how our common stock will trade in the future. The market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, most of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u00b7\ndispositions, acquisitions and financings;\n\u00b7\nactions of our current shareholders, including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and our directors and executive officers;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments; and\n\u00b7\nother developments in the financial services industry.\nThe market value of our common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of our shareholders' equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the liquidation of Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., its lenders and holders of its debt or preferred securities would receive a distribution of the available assets of Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to incur debt and issue other securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of our common stock and dilute the interests of our shareholders.\nRegulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common stock.\nSouthern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., is an entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary bank, and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from the subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company is and will be dependent upon dividends from its subsidiary bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. The Bank's ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common or preferred stock. Also, the Company's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. In addition, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future.\nIf we defer interest payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities or if certain defaults relating to those debt securities occur, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to, our common stock.\nAs of June 30, 2018, we had outstanding $16.8 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by subsidiaries of ours that are statutory business trusts. As of that date, those debt securities were carried at a fair value of $14.9 million.\nWe guarantee the trust preferred securities described above. The indentures under which the junior subordinated debt securities were issued, together with the guarantee, prohibits us, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, repurchasing, acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to, any of our capital stock at any time when (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the indenture; or (ii) we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the guarantee; or (iii) we have elected to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities. In that regard, we are entitled, at our option but subject to certain conditions, to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities from time to time for up to five years.\nEvents of default under the indentures generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities under certain circumstances, our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debt securities when due, our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation relating to us.\nAs a result of these provisions, if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities, or if any of the other events described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur, we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock, from redeeming, repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any of our common stock, and from making any payments to holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock, we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, Missouri law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock, the election of directors to staggered terms of three years and not permitting cumulative voting in the election of directors. Our bylaws also contain provisions regarding the timing and content of shareholder proposals and nominations for service on the Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 80478, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "SMBC"}
