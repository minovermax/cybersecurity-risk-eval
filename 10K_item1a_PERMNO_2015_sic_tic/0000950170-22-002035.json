Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our industry and our business and could continue to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and ability to service our existing and future indebtedness.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our industry and our business for an extended period of time. While we have reopened all of our theatres as of December 31, 2021, our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the key factors that has materially affected our business is the availability of new films for exhibition at our theatres. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production of films was temporarily halted or delayed and new film releases were postponed or shifted to streaming services, resulting in a drastic reduction in the volume of new films available for theatrical exhibition. Even when new films are available, certain studios have reduced the window for video and digital releases or released films directly to alternative distribution channels such as streaming services simultaneous with a theatrical release. In addition, studios may determine that certain types of film content will not be released for theatrical exhibition in the future and will go straight to streaming platforms.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic federal, state and local governments implemented restrictions that limited in-person gathering and/or movement of guests. Even as many restrictions have been lifted, consumers may not yet be comfortable gathering in a large group or within a closed space for a few hours at a time, which could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer guests and reduced revenues.\nWe cannot predict when, or to what extent, we will recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The longer the pandemic lasts, including repeat or cyclical outbreaks, the longer it will take for us to recover from the adverse effects, continuing to impact our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition, access to credit markets and ability to service our existing and future indebtedness.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. For additional information on risks related to a slowdown or recession, inflationary, supply chain and wage pressures, see \u201c-Other General Risks-General political, social, health and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.\u201d\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including but not limited to those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business depends on film production and performance.\nOur business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets. Reduced volume of film releases, poor performance of films, the disruption in the\nproduction of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the production and marketing efforts of the film distributors to make and promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues. During 2020 and 2021, we saw a significant reduction in the quantity of films available to exhibit in our theatres. We expect the quantity of new film releases available for theatrical exhibition to continue to be lower than historical levels during 2022 as the industry rebounds from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however studios may determine that certain types of films will not be released for theatrical exhibition and will go straight to streaming platforms, further impacting the quantity of films available.\nOur results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nOur results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres. The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods. The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year. In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary. The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend. Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for future periods.\nA deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.\nWe rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres. The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with five major film distributors accounting for approximately 85.5% of U.S. box office revenues and 41 of the top 50 grossing films during 2021. Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre. A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets. We compete for both patrons and licensing of films. In markets where we do not face nearby competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built. The degree of competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, presentation quality, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices. The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre\u2019s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms. We also face competition from new concept theatres such as dine-in theatres and tavern style theatres that open in close proximity to our conventional theatres. If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in competing forms of entertainment or the use of alternative film distribution channels may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.\nWe compete with other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons\u2019 leisure time and disposable income. We also face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as streaming, digital downloads, video on-demand and network television. Some of these distribution channels have seen growth in production in recent years. A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by the shrinking, or elimination of, video and digital release windows.\nThe average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available for DVD, was approximately 90 days and digital purchase for ownership (also known as electronic sell-through) was approximately 74 days for several years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain studios adopted strategies that reduced, or in some cases eliminated, the\nrelease windows. Select studios released certain movie titles to their own streaming platforms either simultaneously with theatrical releases or bypassed theatrical releases altogether. Studios may continue to follow, or expand, these or similar strategies, leading to permanent changes that shorten or eliminate exclusive theatrical windows. If studios continue to reduce or eliminate the windows for certain films even after the industry recovers or, if our guests choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.\nWe have 201 theatres with 1,460 screens in fifteen countries in Latin America as of December 31, 2021. Brazil represented approximately 5% of our consolidated 2021 revenues. Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the U.S. Changes in regulations affecting prices and quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films may adversely affect our international operations. Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation. We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash payments to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nWe are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level. Therefore, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.\nWe also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets. Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.\nWe are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new theatre site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions. We continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally. There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities. As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable. The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties. Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management\u2019s time away from the operation of our business. Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability or cash flows. Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows. We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRisks Related to Financing and Liquidity\nWe have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2,543.3 million in long-term debt obligations, $117.2 million in finance lease obligations and $1,295.4 million in long-term operating lease obligations. Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our lease and debt obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate requirements and to pay dividends;\n\u2022impeding our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt, including our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility;\n\u2022limiting our ability to invest in innovations in technology and implement new platforms or concepts in our theatres; and\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse economic, market and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business operations or to our industry overall, and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors that have lower debt levels.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results. Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to generate cash flows at historical levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings. We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned or a change in outlook to our outstanding debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nWe are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity. The credit ratings issued by the rating agencies represent the rating agency's evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the rating agency\u2019s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered (or outlook thereof could be changed) or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business or industry, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. In particular, our access to the capital markets may be impacted, our other funding sources may decrease, the cost of debt may increase as a result of increased interest rates or fees, and we may be required to provide additional credit assurances, including collateral, under certain contracts or arrangements.\nOur inability to raise funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes (as defined below), upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 4.500%\nConvertible Senior Notes, may lead to defaults under such indenture and under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness.\nIf we settle the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes by cash, or by a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we will be required to make cash payments with respect to the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes being surrendered or converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes is limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the senior secured credit facility) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness (including the senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing Cinemark USA, Inc.\u2019s senior notes).\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes is triggered, holders of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we may elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by payment and delivery of a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Settlement of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes. The 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions (each as defined below) may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into Hedge Transactions with, and sold Warrants (as defined below) to, Option Counterparties (as defined below). The Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be. The Warrants would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of any Warrants on the applicable expiration dates unless, subject to the terms of the Warrants, we elect to cash settle the Warrants. In addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or following any repurchase of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes by us in connection with any fundamental change\nrepurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if any such Hedge Transactions and Warrants fail to become effective, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes Hedge Transactions.\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such Option Counterparties may default under the Hedge Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any Option Counterparty.\nA credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.\nSevere dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all. The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.\nOur ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us. Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements. We suspended our dividend in March 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is uncertain when we will resume paying dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market and the issuance of the shares reserved for future issuance under our incentive plan, in exchange for outstanding warrants, conversion of outstanding 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, or in connection with acquisitions or other corporate events, will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and could result in a decrease in our stock price. We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of common stock. We can also issue shares of our common stock which are authorized but unissued and not reserved for any specific purpose without any action or approval by our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 43,161,550 common units of NCM, which represented an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 26%. We receive monthly theatre access and advertising fees under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company recorded approximately $45.8 million, $36.0 million and $44.1 million in other revenues related to NCM, respectively, $25.9 million, $14.2 million and $0.2 million in cash distributions recorded as a reduction of our investment in NCM, respectively, and $12.9 million, $7.0 million and $0.1 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively. Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well-known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television,\noutdoor advertising and Internet portals. In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM\u2019s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons. If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted. NCM revenues and excess cash distributions have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since NCM's revenues are primarily dependent on theatre attendance, future NCM revenues and excess cash distributions from NCM to the Company will depend on the recovery of the motion picture exhibition industry. Excess cash distributions we have historically received are also restricted through December 2023 in accordance with the credit agreement amendment NCM recently entered into with its lenders.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe are subject to various government regulations which could result in substantial costs.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices in the U.S. and internationally. We must comply with laws regulating, among other things, antitrust activities, employment environment, sale of concession goods, alcoholic beverages, data protection and privacy and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") and similar state disability rights laws. Compliance with the ADA and similar disability rights laws requires us as a public accommodation to reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities. This applies to the construction of new theatres, certain renovations, existing theatres, websites and mobile applications and presentations for the blind, deaf and hard of hearing. Changes in existing laws, regulations or administrative practices or new laws, regulations or administrative practices could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we must comply with state and local government restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may face data protection, data security, and privacy risks in connection with privacy regulation.\nStrict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers\u2019 personally identifying information are evolving in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws impose compliance obligations for the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of personally identifiable information of individuals and creates enhanced rights for individuals. These changes in the legal and regulatory environments in the areas of customer and employee privacy, data security, and cross-border data flows could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities, the limitation on the types of information that we may collect, process and retain, the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements and potential monetary forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance\nWe may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime. We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor market conditions have recently driven increases in wages across our labor base and similar increases may continue in the future. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices, which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorization of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; and\n\u2022provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.\nCertain provisions of our 8.750% secured notes indenture, 5.250% senior notes indenture, our 5.875% senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a \u201cchange of control.\u201d A \u201cchange of control\u201d would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 8.750% Secured Notes, 5.250% Senior Notes and our 5.875% Senior Notes (each as defined below) to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A \u201cchange of control\u201d would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.\nRisks Related to Information Security and Business Disruptions\nAn information security incident, including a cyber security breach, and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe collect, use, store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of the company, our customers, and our employees. We also rely on the availability of information technology systems to operate our business, including for communications, receiving and displaying movies, ticketing, guest services, payments, and other general operations. We rely on some of our vendors to store and process certain data and to manage, host, and/or provide some of our information technology systems. Because of the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, our reliance on vendors to provide, support and protect our systems and data, and the constantly evolving cyber-threat landscape, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of disruption, failure, unauthorized access, cyber-terrorism, human error, misuse, tampering, theft, and other cyber-attacks. These or similar events, whether accidental or intentional, could result in theft, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, which could harm our reputation or result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions or lawsuits. These or similar events could also lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in business impact, including loss of business. Those same scope, complexity, reliance, and changing cyber-threat landscape factors could also affect our ability to adapt to and comply with changing regulations and contractual obligations applicable to data security and privacy, which are increasingly demanding, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. In order to address these risks, we have adopted security measures and technology, operate a security program, and work continuously to evaluate and improve our security posture. However, the development and maintenance of these systems and programs are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As such, there can be no assurance that these or similar events will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nIn addition to Company-specific cyber threats or events, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by cyber-related events affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies. We maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, but the foregoing events or future events could result in costs and business impacts which may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that we may have procured. As a result, future events could have a material impact on our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOther General Risks\nGeneral political, social, health and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.\nOur results of operations are dependent on general political, social, health and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If consumers\u2019 discretionary income declines during a period of an economic downturn or political uncertainty, our operations could be adversely affected. If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs and limit product availability, as reduced supply of certain commodities and labor shortages in the transportation industry have led to limitations in product availability and continued increases in product pricing. Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related pandemics or epidemics, such as flu or other virus outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile we continue to invest in technological innovations, such as laser projectors, motion seats and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry. If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as-yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\nWe may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.\nWe own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nProduct recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe may be found liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated. Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.", "PERMNO": 91915, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "CNK"}
