{"cik": "724571", "company": "FREDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to Fred's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that instance, the trading price of Fred's securities could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.\nOur business is somewhat seasonal.\nWe typically realize a significant portion of our net sales during the Christmas selling season in the fourth quarter in addition to the heavier sales volume we experience around the first of each calendar month. Our inventories and short-term borrowings, if required, increase in anticipation of this holiday season. A seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the Christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms. If for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations, our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in seasonal merchandise.\nWe operate in a competitive industry.\nWe are in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail industry. This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices, and lower margins, required to maintain our competitive position. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers all of which may operate a pharmacy not typically seen in our chain drug store competition, including department stores, variety stores, dollar stores, discount clothing stores, drug stores, grocery stores, outlet stores, convenience stores, warehouse stores and other stores, some of whom may have greater resources than we do. This competitive environment subjects us to various risks, including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth. Some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities, advertising programs, and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts.\nChanges to current dividend payments could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the success of our operations and the management of our cash flows. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends at our current levels. If we fail to maintain dividends at the current levels, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nChanges in third-party reimbursements, including government programs, could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans. For the years ended January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, pharmaceutical sales were 41.9% and 37.7% of total sales, respectively. The health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost-containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions while also moving to a more outcomes based payment model. Payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost. Private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates. Accordingly, reimbursements may be limited or reduced, thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows. Also, access to existing and/or new patients may be hindered or prevented through the implementation of preferred or restricted pharmacy provider networks ultimately impacting the financial results of the pharmacy department. Additionally, and in light of the current macroeconomic environment and recent healthcare legislation known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 which includes provisions that are specific to our pharmacy department, government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix. A general slowdown in the United States economy, rising personal debt levels, rising foreclosure rates, rising fuel prices, or changes in government aid, social security, and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers, which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales, product mix and margins. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, inflation, interest rates, and tax rates, could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products. We might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies, which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance. In addition, increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole.\n- 11 -\nNatural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business.\nUnusually adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or similar disruptions, could significantly reduce our net sales. In addition, these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers. A number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process customer transactions and record results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customer, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt of personal information about our customers. If we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of credit cards in our stores, decline to use our pharmacy department services, or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nMerchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business.\nWe have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors. We purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers, principally in China. As a result, political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Also, our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced. Accordingly, changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings. We purchase a significant amount of goods from Cardinal Health, Procter and Gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our operations and results.\nDelays in openings and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe maintain two distribution facilities in our geographic territory, and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth. One of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores. We plan on expanding and refreshing our network of stores through new store openings and remodeling existing stores each year. Delays in opening, refreshing or remodeling stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth, which may in turn reduce revenue and margin growth. Adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores, such as changes in labor, utilities, fuel and transportation, and other operating costs, could have an adverse impact on us.\nOperational difficulties could disrupt our business.\nOur stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel. Our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores, including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage, may negatively impact our sales and/or margin. In addition, we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost-effective manner; any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process such as a decrease in the capacity of carriers and strikes (e.g., the West Coast port strike spanning the latter part of 2014 and early 2015) could negatively impact the timely receipt of merchandise and increase transportation costs disrupting our store operations. Our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business. We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed. We rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information. The disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our operations.\n- 12 -\nUse of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a long-term supply contract from a single supplier, Cardinal Health, for our pharmaceutical operations. Any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier, deterioration in their financial condition, changes in terms, supplier increases in pharmaceutical costs or an industry-wide change in wholesale business practices, including those of our supplier or the manufacturers with whom our supplier transacts business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nHigher than expected costs and not achieving our targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs, systems and technology could adversely affect our business.\nWe are undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as store upgrades and infrastructure initiatives. The failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nChanges in state or federal legislation or regulations, including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs; trade restrictions, tariffs, quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business.\nUnanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets. Changes in trade restrictions, new tariffs and quotas, and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results.\nWe depend on the success of our new store opening program, including increasing our pharmacy department presence in new and existing stores, for a portion of our growth.\nOur growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores with pharmacy departments. Unavailability of store locations that we deem desirable, delays in the acquisition of pharmacies or opening of new stores, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and the lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth, the costs associated with new stores and/or the profitability of new stores. Our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions.\nWe recently closed the acquisition of Reeves-Sain Drug Store, Inc. Acquiring new a business involves a myriad of risks. There is a risk we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction. This can occur if integration of the acquired business proves to be more complicated than planned, resulting in failure to realize operational synergies and/or failure to mitigate operational dis-synergies, diversion of management attention, and loss of key personnel. It can also occur if the acquired business fails to meet our revenue projections, exposes us to unexpected liabilities, or if our pre-acquisition due diligence fails to uncover issues that negatively affect the value or cost structure of the acquired enterprise. Although we carefully plan our acquisitions, there can be no assurance these and other risks will not prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of the acquisition acquisitions.\nChanges in our ability to attract and retain employees, and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business.\nOur growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level, in distribution facilities, and at the corporate level, including our senior management team. The retail industry has a high turnover rate; therefore, there is a continuous need to recruit and train new store managers and employees. Our failure to retain or successfully replace key personnel at the corporate level may have an adverse effect on our business. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, the Company's reputation, employee morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers, and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees.\nAdverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business.\nWe are a party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims, including those described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Operating results could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against us are made, requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business.\n- 13 -\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products, including food products that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers' lack of understanding of U.S. product liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nOur ability to achieve the results of store closures under our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our continuing operations, we perform research and analysis to discover potential underperforming stores. We use such research and analysis to identify potential store closures. The estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors, including the timing of execution, the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, or unexpected costs, any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan.\nIncreases in our insurance-related costs could significantly affect our business.\nThe costs of many types of insurance and self-insurance, especially workers\u2019 compensation, employee health care and others, have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, economic conditions, terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers. Our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings, and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe, government-approved and non-counterfeit products. We also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers, including some who operate in foreign countries, which could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage. While we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices, no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise. Should a product liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. In addition, we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse effect on our business. If our insurance-related costs increase significantly, or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn 2010, Congress passed the PPACA, which will result in significant structural changes to the health insurance system. Many of these changes were implemented prior to the end of fiscal 2014, and several of the resulting regulations and sub-regulatory guidance have yet to be issued and/or finalized. As a result, uncertainties exist regarding the full impact of this act on our business. The reforms affected the healthcare coverage and plans of Fred's employees as well as our pharmacy department customers, but in-large, our benefit plan designs already met the affordable and minimum coverage standards PPACA required. We cannot predict what, if any, effect the PPACA may have on our pharmacy department business, insurance costs or labor. We also cannot predict other legislative or market-driven changes within the health care system that could affect our business.\nAdverse impacts associated with the current economic environment could affect our business.\nThe lingering economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our business and profitability. Many consumers have suffered financial hardship as a result of job losses, foreclosures, or their inability to obtain short-term financing, all of which could negatively affect their ability to shop in our stores and buy our products. Additionally, decreased consumer demand resulting from a pronounced negative consumer sentiment and an increasing personal savings rate could also negatively affect our sales and profits. Also, our ability to obtain financing, should the need arise outside of our current contractual credit facility, could be at risk due to tightened lending practices resulting from the continuing economic challenges in the United States.\n- 14 -\nCyber-attacks could affect our business.\nIf our information technology (\"IT\") systems are breached due to a cyber-attack, we could experience a material disruption to our IT systems as well as data loss that could have an adverse effect on our business. We could experience operational delays due to the disruption of our IT systems. Future results could be negatively impacted by data theft, destruction or loss, or unplanned release of confidential information. In addition to the operational and data losses we could experience from a cyber-attack, the Company's reputation with our customers, vendors or other third-party affiliates could be damaged.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by volatility in the capital markets.\nWe obtain and manage liquidity from cash flows we generate from our operating activities as well as our access to capital markets, including our credit facilities. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed. Contraction in the credit markets, volatility and low liquidity in the capital markets could result in reduced availability of credit and a higher cost of borrowing, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to the Company.", "PERMNO": 77420, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "FREDQ"}
