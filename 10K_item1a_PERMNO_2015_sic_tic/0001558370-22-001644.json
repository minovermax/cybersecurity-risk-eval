{"cik": "1396033", "company": "LL Flooring Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply generally to companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business, which could adversely affect our financial performance\nThe effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have included and could continue to include disruptions in our supply chain, disruptions or restrictions on the ability or availability of many of our associates to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions, as well as temporary closures of certain of our showrooms, or the facilities of our customers or suppliers. The inability of our suppliers to meet our supply needs in a timely manner could cause delays in delivery to our customers, which could result in the cancellation of orders, customers\u2019 refusal to accept deliveries, discounts to selling prices, and termination of customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for our supply needs, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nIn addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries. It has disrupted the worldwide transportation network leading to less predictable inventory flow. There remains a great deal of uncertainty related to COVID-19, including risks from renewed shutdowns due to COVID-19, continued transportation disruptions, labor availability and consumer spending preferences. The extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including consumer demand for home improvement. The potential impacts to the Company likely will not be fully recoverable.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a highly fluid and rapidly evolving situation, and we cannot anticipate with any certainty the length, scope, or the impacts in each of the jurisdictions that we operate. Various federal, state and local regulatory requirements concerning vaccination status for associates, testing and safety protocols may impose operating costs or restrictions on our business operations, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon the ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates.\nWe believe that our success has depended and continues to depend on the efforts and capabilities of our associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors including market pressure on wage rates, the size and health of the labor market and our reputation within the labor market. If there is significant employee turnover, it may result in increases in our costs due to higher wages, recruiting costs and/or training costs. We may not be able to achieve our operational goals if we are unable to attract, develop and retain qualified associates by providing competitive compensation and benefits, an engaging work experience for an inclusive, diverse team and culture or due to any negative market or industry perception, our stock price, and/or litigation.\nIncreased transportation costs could harm our results of operations.\nThe efficient transportation of our products through our supply chain is a critical component of our operations. If the cost of fuel or other costs, such as duties and international container rates rise it would result in increases in our cost of sales due to additional transportation charges and fees. Additionally, there are a limited number of delivery companies capable of efficiently transporting our products from our suppliers. Consolidation within this industry could result in increased transportation costs. A reduction in the availability of qualified drivers and/or an increase in driver regulations could continue to increase our costs. Transportation costs, both international and domestic, may increase due to the global supply chain disruptions as a result of strong demand for inventory, which have been and may continue to be impacted by any changes in COVID-19 conditions. We may be unable to increase the price of our products to offset increased transportation charges, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open new stores and is subject to many unpredictable factors.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 424 stores throughout the United States. Assuming the continued success of our store model and real estate strategy, we plan to accelerate future openings over the next several years. This growth strategy and the investment associated with the development of each new store may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or decrease our profits. Our future results and ability to implement our growth strategy will depend on various factors, including the following:\n\u25cf as we open more stores, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our store base will decline;\n\u25cf consumers in new markets may be less familiar with our brands, and we may need to increase brand awareness in those markets through additional investments in advertising;\n\u25cf new stores may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs, inventory requirements, or may have lower average store net sales, than stores opened in the past;\n\u25cf competitive pressures could cause changes to our store model and making necessary changes could prove costly;\n\u25cf newly opened stores may reach profitability more slowly than we expect in the future, as we enter more mid-sized and smaller markets and add stores to larger markets where we already have a presence; and\n\u25cf newly opened stores may cause sales to decline in our other existing stores within a given market or trade area.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition to accelerating the growth of new stores over the next several years, we are making technology investments designed to increase orders from our digital platform, Customer Relationship Center and dedicated Pro sales team. Our existing management information systems, including our store management systems, enterprise reporting platform, compliance procedures and financial and reporting controls, may be unable to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain regional and store managers and personnel for our compliance, IT, human resources and financial and reporting departments. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on us. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nDamage, destruction or disruption of our distribution centers could significantly impact our operations and impede our ability to distribute certain of our products.\nWe have two distribution centers that house products for the direct shipment of flooring to our stores. If either of our distribution centers or our inventory held in those locations were damaged or destroyed by fire, tornado, flooding, wood infestation or other causes, our distribution processes would be disrupted. If the major highways or railways leading to and from our distribution centers were shutdown due to weather or infrastructure conditions, our distribution processes would also be disrupted. Any of these disruptions to the distribution centers could cause significant delays in delivery. This could impede our ability to stock our stores and deliver products to our customers, and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nOur representative office in China may present increased legal and operational risks.\nWe have a representative office in Shanghai, China to facilitate our product sourcing in Asia. We may incur increased costs in complying with applicable local-country laws and regulations as they pertain to our products, operations and related activities. Further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to, among other things, litigation and government and agency investigations.\nFailure to effectively manage our third-party installers may present increased legal and operational risks.\nWe manage third-party professional independent contractors who provide installation services to some of our customers. In some jurisdictions, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established procedures designed to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these procedures effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement and litigation and our net sales and our profitability and reputation could be harmed.\nUnfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions surrounding our products or us could harm our reputation and impair our ability to grow or sustain our business.\nWe have been involved in a number of government investigations and legal actions, many of which have resulted from unfavorable allegations regarding our products and us. Negative publicity surrounding these government investigations and legal actions could continue to harm our reputation and the demand for our products. Additional unfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions involving our products and us could also affect our perception in the market and our brands and negatively impact our business and financial condition. For instance, unfavorable allegations with certain regulators surrounding the compliance of our laminates that had previously been sourced from China has negatively affected and could continue to negatively affect our operations. If this negative impact is significant, our ability to maintain our liquidity and grow or sustain our business could be jeopardized. The cost to defend ourselves and our former associates has been and could continue to be significant.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of the outcomes of these proceedings could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are, or may become, involved in legal proceedings, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Item 8. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). While we have accrued for material liabilities in connection with certain of these proceedings, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcomes. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings could require us to take actions which could be costly to implement or otherwise negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and could affect our ability to obtain capital or access our revolving loan and continue as a going concern. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings involves significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur overall compliance program, including the Lacey Compliance Plan, is complex and costly to maintain. A failure to manage these programs could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation, and, consequently, negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nAs disclosed in October 2015, we reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regarding our compliance with the Lacey Act. In connection with that settlement, we agreed to implement the Lacey Compliance Plan, and we were subject to a probation period of five years. Our implementation of the Lacey Compliance Plan, together with requirements resulting from other settlement agreements we have entered into over the past few years (including the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the \u201cDPA\u201d) with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (the \u201cU.S. Attorney\u201d) and the DOJ entered into on March 12, 2019), was costly. In the event we breach the DPA, there is a risk the U.S. Attorney and the DOJ would seek to impose remedies provided for in the DPA, including criminal prosecution. Further, the failure to properly manage our overall compliance program and fully comply with the obligations imposed upon us by these various settlement agreements or implement any of the compliance requirements arising from these obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover existing or future claims.\nWith the large number of cases and government investigations, we may be required to defend ourselves and our officers, directors and former associates and we may be subject to financial harm in the event such cases or investigations are adversely determined and insurance coverage will not, or is not sufficient to, cover any related losses. We maintain various insurance policies, including directors and officers insurance, as well as the following:\n\u25cf We are self-insured on certain health insurance plans and workers\u2019 compensation coverage and are responsible for losses up to a certain limit for these respective plans.\n\u25cf We continue to be responsible for losses up to a certain limit for general liability and property damage insurance.\n\u25cf Our professional liability and cyber security insurance policies contain limitations on the amount and scope of coverage.\nFor policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than those recorded, which could adversely impact our operating results. Additionally, our experience could limit our ability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage, subjecting us to further loss, or could require significantly increased premiums.\nFederal, provincial, state or local laws and regulations, including tariffs, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, and our obligations under certain settlement agreements related to our products could increase our expenses, restrict our ability to conduct our business and expose us to legal risks.\nWe are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations imposed by federal, provincial, state and local authorities in the countries in which we operate, including those related to tariffs, customs, foreign operations (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, zoning and occupancy matters as well as the operation of retail stores and warehouse, production and distribution facilities and provision of installation services. In addition, various federal, provincial and state laws govern our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our associates, including wage and hour-related laws. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk, our operations could be impacted negatively and our reputation could be damaged. Likewise, if such laws and regulations should change, our costs of compliance may increase, thereby impacting our results and our profitability.\nCertain portions of our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, and the health and safety of associates. If we are unable to comply with, extend or renew a material approval, license or permit required by such laws, or if there is a delay in renewing any material approval, license or permit, our net sales and operating results could deteriorate or otherwise cause harm to our business.\nWith regard to our products, we spend significant resources in order to comply with applicable advertising, importation, exportation, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we should violate these laws and regulations, we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines, penalties, criminal charges, or other legal risks, be liable for costs and damages, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations should change we may experience increased costs in order to adhere to the new standards. We are also subject to a number of settlement agreements that impose certain obligations on us with respect to the operation of our business. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we may experience additional costs and expenses and could be subject to additional legal risks.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers, Products and Product Sourcing\nOur ability and cost to obtain cost-effective products, especially from Asia and other international suppliers, and the operations of many of our international suppliers are subject to risks that may be beyond our control and that could harm our operations and profitability.\nWe rely on a select group of international suppliers to provide us with imported flooring products that meet our specifications. In 2021, our imported product was sourced from Asia, Europe, Australia and South America. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with obtaining products from abroad, including:\n\u25cf the imposition of duties (including antidumping and countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes and/or other charges on exports or imports;\n\u25cf the impact of a pandemic, including COVID-19;\n\u25cf political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries where our products originate;\n\u25cf currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and climate change issues, labor conditions, quality and safety standards, trade restrictions, and restrictions on funds transfers;\n\u25cf disruptions or delays in production, shipments, delivery or processing through ports of entry; and\n\u25cf differences in product standards, acceptable business practices and legal environments of the country of origin.\nBy the end of 2021, approximately 20% of our product was sourced from China down from 34% a year ago. Included in merchandise inventories are tariff-related costs, including Section 301 tariffs on certain products imported from China in recent years. In November 2019, a subset of these imports for certain click vinyl and other engineered products (the \u201cSubset Products\u201d) received an exemption that was made retroactive to the initial levying of the Section 301 Tariffs. However, as of August 7, 2020, the exclusions on subset products expired and certain flooring products imported from China were again subject to a 25% Section 301 tariff. Potential costs and any attendant impact on pricing arising from these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could disrupt the ability of our suppliers to ship certain products to us cost-effectively or at all, which could harm our operations. If our product costs and consumer demand are adversely affected by foreign trade issues (including pandemic-related delays, import tariffs and other trade restrictions with China), our sales and profitability may suffer.\nThe inflation or deflation of product cost could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\nPrices of certain products are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in international and domestic supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in product cost may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\nFailure to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers could affect our ability to obtain products that meet our high quality standards.\nWe purchase flooring directly from mills located around the world. We believe that these direct supplier relationships are important to our business. In order to retain the competitive advantage that we believe results from these relationships, we need to continue to identify, develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our high standards for quality and our requirements for the delivery of hard-surface materials in a timely and efficient manner. We expect the need to develop new relationships to be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations, enhance our product offerings, and expand our product assortment and geographic source of origin in the future. Any inability to do so could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for a significant portion of our supply needs. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. In the future, our suppliers may be unable to supply us, or supply us on acceptable terms, due to various factors, which could include political instability in the supplier\u2019s country, insufficient production capacity, product line failures, collusion, a supplier\u2019s financial instability, inability or refusal to comply with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs or our standards, duties, insufficient transport capacity and other factors beyond our control. In these circumstances, we could experience deterioration in our net sales and operating results.\nThe failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, use ethical practices, and meet our quality standards could result in our suspending purchasing from them, negatively impacting net sales, and could expose us to reputational and legal risks.\nWhile our suppliers agree to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control our suppliers. Accordingly, despite our continued investment in compliance and quality control, we cannot guarantee that they comply with such laws and regulations or operate in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. While we monitor our suppliers\u2019 adherence to our compliance and quality standards, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify non-compliance. Moreover, the failure of our suppliers to adhere to applicable legal requirements and the quality standards that we set for our products could lead to government investigations, litigation, write-offs and recalls, any of which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business. Additionally, our ability to travel and monitor suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause delays in bringing product to market.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our reputation, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nWe have faced and continue to face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury, property damage, violated environmental or other laws. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective or otherwise in violation of applicable laws, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Further, in such instances, we may be subject to legal action. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be available or adequate for the liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.\nOur ability to offer hardwood flooring, particularly products made of certain species of hardwood, depends on the continued availability of sufficient suitable hardwood at reasonable cost.\nOur business strategy depends on offering a wide assortment of hardwood flooring to our customers. We sell flooring made from species ranging from domestic maple, oak and pine to imported acacia, cherry, koa, mahogany and teak. Some of these species are difficult to source, and we cannot be assured of their continued availability. Our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of hard-to-find species depends on our suppliers\u2019 ability to furnish those species, which, in turn, could be affected by many things including events such as forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases, prolonged drought and other adverse weather and climate conditions. Government regulations relating to forest management practices also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to harvest or export timber, and changes to regulations and forest management policies, or the implementation of new laws or regulations, could impede their ability to do so. If our suppliers cannot deliver sufficient hardwood and we cannot find replacement suppliers, our net sales and operating results may be negatively impacted.\nThe cost of the various species of hardwood that are used in our products is important to our profitability. Hardwood lumber costs fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, product availability, environmental restrictions, government regulation and trade policies, duties, weather conditions, processing and freight costs, and delivery delays and disruptions. We generally do not have long-term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing hardwood costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, and we may not always be able to increase the selling prices of our products in response to increases in supply costs. If we cannot address changing hardwood costs appropriately, it could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nRisks Relating to Our Competitive Positioning\nIneffectiveness of our advertising strategy or negative perceptions of our brand could result in reduced customer traffic, thereby impacting net sales and profitability.\nWe believe that our growth thus far was achieved in part through our successful investment in local and national advertising. Historically, we have used extensive advertising to encourage customers to drive to our stores, which were, at times, located some distance from population centers in areas that have lower rents than traditional retail locations. Further, a significant portion of our advertising was directed at the DIY and installation customers. As our brand and marketing strategies continue to evolve, we have broadened the content of our advertising to increase the awareness of our great value, superior service and broad selection of high-quality, hard-surface flooring products. During 2021 we made significant progress in the transition of our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. If there are negative perceptions about the evolution of our brand strategies, our name change, or our advertisements fail to draw customers in the future, or if the cost of advertising or other marketing materials increases significantly, we could experience declines in our net sales and operating results both in-store and through our digital platform.\nCompetition could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share.\nWe operate in the hard-surface flooring industry, which is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from national and regional home improvement chains, national and regional specialty flooring chains, Internet-based companies and privately owned single-site enterprises. We compete on the basis of price, customer service, store location and the range, quality and availability of the hard-surface flooring that we offer our customers. If our positioning with regard to one or more of these factors should erode, deteriorate, fail to resonate with consumers or misalign with demand or expectations, our business and results may be negatively impacted.\nOur competitive position is also influenced by the availability, quality and cost of merchandise, labor costs, distribution and sales efficiencies and our productivity compared to that of our competitors. Further, as we expand into new and unfamiliar markets, we may face different competitive environments than in the past. Likewise, as we continue to enhance and develop our product offerings, we may experience new competitive conditions.\nSome of our competitors are larger organizations, have existed longer, are more diversified in the products they offer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. In addition, our competitors may forecast market developments more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours, produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share.\nHard-surface flooring may become less popular as compared to other types of floor coverings in the future. For example, our products are made using various hardwood species, and concern over the environmental impact of tree harvesting could shift consumer preferences towards synthetic or inorganic flooring. In addition, hardwood flooring competes against carpet, vinyl sheet, vinyl tile, ceramic tile, natural stone and other types of floor coverings. If consumer preferences shift toward types of floor coverings that we do not sell, we may experience decreased demand for our products.\nAll of these competitive factors may harm us and reduce our net sales and operating results.\nRisks Related to Economic Factors and Our Access to Capital\nCyclicality in the home flooring industry, coupled with our lack of diversity in our lines of business, could cause volatility and risk to our business.\nThe hard-surface flooring industry is highly dependent on the remodeling of existing homes and new home construction. Remodeling and new home construction are cyclical and depend on a number of factors which are beyond our control, including interest and inflation rates, tax policy, real estate prices, employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, demographic trends, weather conditions, natural disasters and general economic conditions.\nIn the event of a decrease in discretionary spending, home remodeling activity or new home construction, demand for our products, including hard-surface flooring, could be impacted negatively and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nThe inability to access our Revolving Credit Facility or other sources of capital, could cause our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations to suffer.\nWe have relied on and expect to continue to rely on a bank credit agreement to fund our needs for working capital. During 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment to our Credit Agreement. The execution of the Second Amendment, among other things, terminated the FILO Term Loans and converted those commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility. The total size of the Credit Agreement remained at $200 million, and the Company has an option to the increase the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum total amount of $250 million. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to April 30, 2026. Our access to the Revolving Credit Facility depends on our ability to meet the conditions for borrowing, including that all representations are true and correct at the time of the borrowing. Our failure to meet these requirements or obtain additional or alternative sources of capital could impact:\n\u25cf our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, store expansion and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf our ability to meet our liquidity needs, arising from, among other things, legal matters; and\n\u25cf our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology\nIf our management information systems, including our digital platform or our Customer Relationship Center, experience disruptions, it could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales.\nWe depend on our management information systems to integrate the activities of our stores, digital platform and Customer Relationship Center, to process orders, make outgoing calls to customers, to respond to customer inquiries, to manage inventory, to purchase merchandise and to sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. We may incur significant expenses in order to repair any such operational problems. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and customers or lost sales. For example, as we previously disclosed in August 2019, we experienced a malicious network security incident during that year for approximately a week that prevented access to several of our information technology systems and data within our networks. Based on the nature of the network security incident, the impact on our information technology systems and the results of the forensic IT analysis, we do not believe confidential customer, employee or company data was lost or disclosed. Moreover, our entire corporate network, including our telephone lines, is on an Internet-based network, which is vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties, including changes in the required technology interfaces, digital platform downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and customer privacy concerns. Accordingly, if our network is disrupted or if we cannot successfully maintain our digital platform and Customer Relationship Center in good working order, we may experience delayed communications within our operations and between our customers and ourselves, and may not be able to communicate at all via our network, including via telephones connected to our network.\nWe may incur costs and losses resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards for payment in our stores and through our Customer Relationship Center. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. As a result, we may become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Further, a compromise of our security systems that results in our customers\u2019 personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A security breach could also require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.\nAdditionally, privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\nAlternative e-commerce and online shopping offerings may erode our customer base and adversely affect our business.\nOur long-term future depends heavily upon the general public\u2019s willingness to use our stores as a means to purchase goods. In recent years, e-commerce has become more widely accepted as a means of purchasing consumer goods and services, which could adversely impact customer traffic in our stores. Additionally, certain of our competitors offer alternative e-commerce and online shopping. If consumers use alternative e-commerce and online shopping offerings to conduct business as opposed to our store locations, it could materially adversely impact our net sales and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile and all or part of any investment in our common stock may be lost.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf our concentration in the cyclical home improvement industry;\n\u25cf trading activity of our current or future stockholders, including common stock transactions by our directors and executive officers;\n\u25cf trading activity by retail investors participating in online investing forums or chat rooms;\n\u25cf industry-related trends and growth prospects; and\n\u25cf unfavorable market reactions to allegations regarding the safety of our products and the related litigation and/or government investigations resulting therefrom, as well as any payments, judgments or other losses in connection with such allegations and any resultant lawsuits and/or investigations.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us or our performance.\nOur anti-takeover defense provisions may cause our common stock to trade at market prices lower than it might absent such provisions.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include a staggered board, the availability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, provisions restricting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or from taking action by written consent and provisions that set forth advance notice procedures for stockholders\u2019 nominations of directors and proposals of topics for consideration at meetings of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which relates to business combinations with interested stockholders, applies to us. These provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. In addition, these provisions may cause our common stock to trade at a market price lower than it might absent such provisions.", "PERMNO": 92400, "SIC": 5211, "TIC": "LL"}
