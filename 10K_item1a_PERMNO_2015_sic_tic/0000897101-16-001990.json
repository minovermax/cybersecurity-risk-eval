You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report, before investing in our common stock. Realization of any of the following risks, or adverse results from any matter listed under \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. If you invest in our common stock, then you might lose all or part of your investment. This report also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, estimates and projections as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in our Company, and our financial condition and results of operations may deteriorate if we fail to diversify.\nOur business has initially focused on a single rail car transloading facility in New Town, North Dakota. Since inception, we have focused solely on generating income through crude oil and frac sand transloading at the facility. We intend to continue to pursue additional business lines, including the additional business of transporting and storing other drilling-related products from and into the Williston Basin. Our ability to diversify our investments will depend on our access to additional capital and financing sources and the availability of real property and other assets required to allow us to load and transport crude oil and related products.\nLarger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of our business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting the transportation and crude oil industries or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, enhancing our risk profile. If we cannot diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations could deteriorate.\nStrategic relationships upon which we may rely are subject to change, which may diminish our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur ability to successfully transload crude oil and frac sand depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants, selecting and evaluating suitable business arrangements, and being able to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. These relationships are subject to change and may impair our ability to grow.\nWe are dependent on independent third parties to provide trucking and rail services and to report certain events to us including delivery information. We do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 products.\nOur reliance on third parties could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. These risks include:\n\u00b7 equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among rail carriers and parties that lease rail cars transporting crude oil products;\n\u00b7\npotential substantial additional capital improvements required to maintain facility;\n\u00b7 interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor or other issues;\n\u00b7 Canadian Pacific\u2019s capacity constraints;\n\u00b7 competing facilities being constructed in close proximity;\n\u00b7 impact of weather at origin (e.g. snow, flooding, cold temperatures) on all operations;\n\u00b7 impact of weather at destinations (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding);\n\u00b7 congestion at offloading sites;\n\u00b7 inadequate storage facilities;\n\u00b7 changes in regulations impacting transportation; and\n\u00b7 unanticipated changes in transportation rates.\nCompetition for the loading and transporting of crude oil and related products may impair our business.\nThe transportation industry is highly competitive. Per the Association of American Railroads September 2014 Moving Crude Oil by Rail report, in 2008, U.S. Class I railroads originated 9,500 carloads of crude oil. In 2015, 410,249 carloads of crude oil were originated compared to 493,146 carloads of crude oil in 2014; a 16.8% decrease. According to rail industry statistics, in 2008, a train of 100 rail cars full of crude oil departed a terminal in North Dakota once every four days. By 2013, a unit train of crude oil was departing every 2.5 hours. As a result of the increase in crude oil moved via rail, other companies have recently acquired and constructed transloading facilities to compete with our Company. This competition is expected to become increasingly intense as November 2015 marked the first month since June 2012 that a higher percentage of crude oil was moved out of North Dakota via pipeline, a shift caused by the narrowing price spread between WTI and Brent, which has made imports of foreign crude oil cheaper for East Coast refineries than Bakken sourced crude oil shipped by rail. We intend initially to focus on transporting crude oil through the Canadian Pacific system. We will also compete directly with other parties transporting crude oil using Canadian Pacific, the Burlington Northern Railway, various trucking and similar concerns, the Enbridge, Tesoro, PAA and Butte pipelines and any other pipelines that are constructed and operated in North Dakota. Any material increase in the capacity and quality of these alternative methods or the passage of legislation granting greater latitude to them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, a failure to provide the level of service required by our customers could result in loss of business to competitors. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry\u2019s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors\u2019 products and services.\nAdditionally, other transportation companies may compete with us from time to time in obtaining capital from investors or in funding joint ventures with our prospective partners. Competitors include a variety of potential investors and larger companies, which, in particular, may have access to greater resources, may be more successful in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and may conduct their own refining and petroleum marketing operations, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests. If we are unable to compete effectively or adequately respond to competitive pressures, this inability may materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims, costs and liabilities as a result of events resulting from the transportation of crude oil by or on behalf of our subsidiaries.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be subject to claims, costs and liabilities relating to events that may occur while the crude oil is en route to its destination. Such claims, costs and liabilities may result from actions of third parties outside our control and may include releases of crude oil and resulting environmental liabilities and damage to property, injury or loss of life resulting from exposure or ignition of crude oil in transit. In addition, we, our subsidiaries, and their affiliates contract from time to time with additional third parties in connection with the transportation of crude oil, including arrangements with third party rail carriers, road transportation providers, and railcar leasing companies.\nOn July 6, 2013, a freight train operated by Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway (\u201cMMA\u201d) with 72 tank cars carrying approximately 50,000 barrels of crude oil derailed in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec. The derailment resulted in significant loss of life, damage to the environment from spilled crude oil and extensive property damage. DPTSM, a crude oil marketing joint venture in which, at the time of the derailment, we indirectly owned a 50% membership interest, subleased the tank cars involved in the incident from an affiliate of our former joint venture partner. A different affiliate of our former joint venture partner owned title to the crude oil being carried in the derailed tank cars. DPTS, a crude oil transloading joint venture in which we also, at the time of the derailment, indirectly owned a 50% membership interest, arranged for the transloading of the crude oil for DPTSM into tank cars at DPTS\u2019s facility in New Town, North Dakota. An affiliate of our former joint venture partner also contracted with Canadian Pacific Railway (\u201cCPR\u201d) for the transportation of the tank cars and the crude oil from New Town, North Dakota to a customer in New Brunswick, Canada. CPR subcontracted a portion of that route to MMA.\nWe, certain of our subsidiaries, DPTSM and DPTS, along with a number of third parties, including CPR, MMA and certain of its affiliates, as well as several manufacturers and lessors of tank cars, were named as defendants in lawsuits and proceedings related to the incident.\nAs a result of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic derailment, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation into the cause of the derailment and the events surrounding it. In addition, the Quebec police conducted a criminal investigation in conjunction with Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities.\nAdditional claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations and orders may be filed, commenced or issued with respect to the incident, which may involve civil claims for damages or governmental investigative, regulatory or enforcement actions against us. The adverse resolution of any proceedings related to these events could subject us and/or DPTSM or DPTS to monetary damages, fines and other costs, which could have a negative and material impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we and our joint ventures, DPTSM and DPTS, maintain insurance to mitigate the costs of environmental releases as well as other results of unexpected events, including loss of life, property damage and defense costs, there can be no guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to cover all liabilities that may be incurred as a result of this incident.\nWe are also evaluating potential claims that we may assert against third parties to recover costs and other liabilities that may be incurred as a result of this incident. We can provide no guarantee that any such claims, if brought by us, will be successful or, if successful, that the responsible parties will have the financial resources to address any such claims. Any losses not covered by insurance or otherwise not recoverable from third parties, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe train derailment in Lac-M\u00e9gantic may result in increased governmental regulation of shipments of crude oil and other fuel products and additional costs.\nWe rely in part on rail shipments to move crude oil and other fuel products in both the United States and Canada. The accident in Lac-M\u00e9gantic and its aftermath has led and could lead to additional governmental regulation of rail shipments of crude oil and other fuel products in Canada and the United States and to increased safety standards for the tanker-cars that transport these products. We cannot predict with any certainty what form any additional regulation or limitations would take. Any increased regulation that arises out of this incident could result in higher operating costs, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional capital that we will require to implement our business plan, which could restrict our ability to grow.\nWe likely will require additional capital to continue operating our business beyond our current opportunities. Future facility expansions will require additional capital and cash flow. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our current operations to fund our proposed business opportunities.\nFuture arrangements with other crude oil marketing firms and operators will require us to expand our facility to meet the logistical and storage needs that accompany larger throughput commitments. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders. This could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. Given the attractive return profiles of our potential customer arrangements, we expect that any additional capital required to fulfill our transloading commitments would be funded through our cash flow. The terms of securities we issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable to our new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have a further dilutive effect.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both generally and in the energy industry in particular), the single location near New Town, North Dakota that we currently operate (which limits our ability to diversify our activities) and/or the loss of key management. Further, if crude oil prices or the commodities markets continue to experience significant volatility or stagnation, such market conditions will likely adversely impact our income by decreasing demand for our services and simultaneously increasing our requirements for capital. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our income from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even if we reduce our operations), we may be required to cease our operations entirely.\nWe may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which may harm our profitability.\nOur strategy envisions continued expansion of our business. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our financial results could be adversely affected. Growth may place a strain on our management systems and resources. We must continue to refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. As we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 meet our capital needs;\n\u00b7 expand our systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 allocate our human resources optimally;\n\u00b7 identify and hire qualified employees or retain valued employees; or\n\u00b7 incorporate effectively the components of any business that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our operations and our financial results could be adversely affected by inefficiency, which could diminish our profitability.\nOur business may suffer if we do not attract and retain talented personnel.\nOur success will depend in large measure on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our management and other personnel in conducting our business. We have a small management team, and the loss of a key individual or inability to attract suitably qualified staff could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur success depends on the ability of our management and employees to interpret market data correctly and to interpret and respond to economic market and other conditions in order to locate and adopt appropriate investment opportunities, monitor such investments, and ultimately, if required, to successfully divest such investments. Further, no assurance can be given that our key personnel will continue their association or employment with us or that replacement personnel with comparable skills can be found. We will seek to ensure that management and any key employees are appropriately compensated; however, their services cannot be guaranteed. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with these new or revised accounting standards and as such we are not required to have auditor attestation on our internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). As an accelerated filer, we would otherwise be required to have auditor attestation of ICFR. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective dates. If we were to elect to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT if we cannot maintain compliance with NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nCurrently, we are not in compliance with NYSE\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement and minimum bid price requirement but have submitted a compliance plan that outlines the actions we intend to take in order to regain compliance with the continued listing standards on or before April 14, 2017. If we fail to regain compliance with the applicable requirements, our stock may be delisted. Delisting from the NYSE MKT could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a NYSE MKT listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from the NYSE MKT could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by NYSE, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter exchange. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from the NYSE MKT, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter exchange.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE MKT, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly, would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nBuilding and operating a transloading facility is risky and may not be commercially successful, and the advanced technologies we use cannot eliminate competition and environmental risk, which could impair our ability to generate income from our operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to manage and operate the Pioneer Terminal. We will be almost entirely dependent on the demand to transport crude oil from wells in relatively close proximity to New Town, North Dakota.\nOur ability to generate a return on our investments, income and our resulting financial performance are significantly affected by the prices oil exploration and production companies receive for crude oil produced from their wells.\nEspecially in recent years, the prices at which crude oil trade in the open market have experienced significant volatility and will likely continue to fluctuate in the foreseeable future due to a variety of influences including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign demand for crude oil by both refineries and end users;\n\u00b7 the introduction of alternative forms of fuel to replace or compete with crude oil;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign reserves and supply of crude oil;\n\u00b7 competitive measures implemented by our competitors and domestic and foreign governmental bodies;\n\u00b7 political climates in nations that traditionally produce and export significant quantities of crude oil (including military and other conflicts in the Middle East and surrounding geographic region) and regulations and tariffs imposed by exporting and importing nations;\n\u00b7 weather conditions; and\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign economic volatility and stability.\nDemand for crude oil and crude oil related products is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the global economy, changes in the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets and volatility in crude oil prices could impact our customers\u2019 spending levels and our revenues and operating results.\nThe past slowdown in global economic growth and recession in the developed economies resulted in reduced demand for crude oil, increased spare productive capacity and lower energy prices. Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit market could reduce our customers\u2019 spending levels and reduce our revenues and operating results. Incremental weakness in global economic activity will reduce demand for crude oil and result in lower crude oil prices. Incremental strength in global economic activity will create more demand for crude oil and support higher crude oil prices. In addition, demand for crude oil could be impacted by environmental regulation, including \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation, carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations.\nVolatility in crude oil prices can also impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nLower crude oil prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher crude oil prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Any of these factors could affect the demand for crude oil and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Prolonged periods of low crude oil prices could cause crude oil exploration and production to become economically unfeasible or lead to a decrease in the transloading fee per barrel that we are able to charge our customers. Decreased drilling and/or production activities by crude oil exploration and production companies could reduce demand for transportation of crude oil and adversely impact our business. A decrease in crude oil prices could also adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital to pursue future diversification and expansion activities.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources.\nCrude oil competes with other sources of energy, some of which may be less costly on an equivalent energy basis. In addition, we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our operations.\nOur inability to obtain necessary facilities could hamper our operations.\nTransloading crude oil and related products is dependent on the availability of real estate adjacent to railways and roadways, construction materials and contractors, transloading equipment, transportation methods, power and technical support in the particular areas where these activities will be conducted. Our access to these facilities may be limited. Demand for such limited real estate, equipment, construction materials and contractors or access restrictions may affect the availability of such real estate and equipment to us and may delay our business activities. The pricing and grading of appropriate real estate may also be unpredictable and we may be required to make efforts to upgrade and standardize our facilities, which may entail unanticipated costs and delays. Shortages and/or the unavailability of necessary construction materials, contractors and equipment may impair our activities, either by delaying our activities, increasing our costs or otherwise.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining crude oil to transport, which could harm our financial condition.\nIn order to transport crude oil, we depend on our ability to secure customers. We also rely on local infrastructure and the availability of transportation for storage and shipment of crude oil to our facility, but infrastructure development and storage and transportation facilities may be insufficient for our needs at commercially acceptable terms in the localities in which we operate. Customers may also decide to utilize one or more of our competitors for a variety of reasons, and any lack of demand for use of our facility and related services would be particularly problematic.\nFurthermore, weather conditions or natural disasters, actions by companies doing business in one or more of the areas in which we operate, or labor disputes may impair the distribution of crude oil and in turn diminish our financial condition or ability to maintain our operations.\nSupplies of crude oil are subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProductive capacity for crude oil is dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce crude oil reserves. The ability to produce crude oil can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline.\nIncreases in our operating expenses will impact our operating results and financial condition.\nReal estate acquisition, construction and regulatory compliance costs (including taxes) will substantially impact the net income we derive from the crude oil and frac sand that we transload. These costs are subject to fluctuations and variation in different locales in which we will operate, and we may not be able to predict or control these costs. If these costs exceed our expectations, this may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to earn net income at our predicted levels, which may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nA downturn in the economy or change in government policy could negatively impact demand for our services.\nSignificant, extended negative changes in economic conditions that impact the producers and consumers of the commodities transloaded by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, changes in United States and foreign government policies could change the economic environment and affect demand for our services. For example, changes in clean air laws or regulation promoting alternative fuels could reduce the demand for crude oil and, in turn, the transloading thereof. Also, United States and foreign government agriculture tariffs or subsidies could affect the demand for crude oil and, in turn, the transloading thereof.\nPenalties we may incur could impair our business.\nFailure to comply with government regulations could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, could require us to forfeit property rights, and may affect the value of our assets. We may also be required to take corrective actions, such as installing additional equipment or taking other actions, each of which could require us to make substantial capital expenditures. We could also be required to indemnify our third-party contractors and employees in connection with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against them. As a result, our future business prospects could deteriorate due to regulatory constraints, and our profitability could be impaired by our obligation to provide such indemnification to our employees.\nWe and the oil and gas transportation industry in general are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may impose significant costs on its business operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. Changes to or limits on carbon dioxide emissions could result in significant capital expenditures to comply with these regulations with respect to our equipment, vehicles and machinery. Emission regulations could also adversely affect fuel efficiency and increase operating costs. Further, permit requirements or concerns regarding emissions and other forms of pollution could inhibit our ability to build or operate our facilities in strategic locations to facilitate growth and efficient operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by our subsidiaries. Environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. An accidental release of hazardous materials could result in a significant loss of life and extensive property damage. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to transportation of hazardous materials. We could incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination and maintain compliance with licensing or permitting requirements related to the foregoing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur insurance may be inadequate to cover liabilities we may incur.\nOur involvement in the transloading of crude oil and related products may result in us becoming subject to liability for pollution, property damage, personal injury, death or other hazards. Although we have obtained insurance in accordance with industry standards to address such risks, such insurance and indemnification has limitations on liability that may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of such liabilities. In addition, such risks may not, in all circumstances, be insurable or, in certain circumstances, we may choose not to obtain insurance to protect against specific risks due to the high premiums associated with such insurance or for other reasons. The payment of such uninsured liabilities would reduce the funds available to us. If we suffer a significant event or occurrence that is not fully insured, or if the insurer of such event is not solvent, we could be required to divert funds from capital investment or other uses towards covering our liability for such events, and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur business will suffer if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary licenses.\nOur operations require licenses, permits and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to change in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable governments, among other factors. Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extension, to any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce income from our operations.\nChallenges to our properties may impact our financial condition.\nParties from whom we purchase real estate for our facilities, such as railways, may not provide warranty deeds ensuring we receive proper title to our properties. While we intend to make appropriate inquiries into the title of properties and other development rights we acquire, title defects may exist. In addition, we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for title defects, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. If title defects do exist, it is possible that we may lose all or a portion of our right, title and interests in and to the properties to which the title defects relate. If our property rights are reduced, our ability to conduct our business activities may be impaired.\nWe will rely on technology to conduct our business and our technology could become ineffective, obsolete or temporarily unavailable.\nWe rely on technology, including transloading techniques and economic models, to operate our facilities and to guide our business activities. We will be required to continually enhance and update our technology to maintain its effectiveness and to avoid disuse. The costs of doing so may be substantial, and may be higher than the costs that we anticipate for technology maintenance and development. If we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our technology, our ability to manage our business and to compete may be impaired. Further, even if we are able to maintain technical effectiveness, our technology may not be the most efficient means of reaching our objectives, in which case we may incur higher operating costs than we would were our technology more efficient.\nFuture acts of terrorism or war, as well as the threat of war, may cause significant disruptions in our business operations.\nTerrorist attacks and any government response to those types of attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Rail lines and facilities we utilize could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition. Such effects could be magnified if they involve the release of hazardous materials. Any act of terror, retaliatory strike, sustained military campaign or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition by causing or resulting in unpredictable operating or financial conditions, including disruptions of rail lines, volatility or sustained increase of fuel prices, fuel shortages, general economic decline and instability or weakness of financial markets. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by our Company could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future.", "PERMNO": 14717, "SIC": 5171, "TIC": "DAKPQ"}
