{"cik": "1133311", "company": "TRAVELZOO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any or all of the risks listed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline or cause substantial volatility in our stock price, in which event the value of your common stock could decline. You should also keep these risk factors in mind when you read forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Business Model\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry and our business and financial performance.\nThe measures implemented to contain COVID-19 have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. The measures implemented led to many of our advertisers pausing, canceling, or stopping advertising with us, as well as a high level of cancellations for our hotel partners and travel package partners, and refund requests for vouchers sold by Travelzoo for restaurant and spa partners. However, we have modified our policies, particularly with our vouchers, to extend expiration dates and allow for full refundability and have received positive feedback from Travelzoo members. We are also seeing many advertisers and partners starting to return to advertising with us, as the effects of the pandemic subside, although with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, this trend could stop or even reverse. We will continue to adapt our business strategy and policies as the situation evolves.\nAny changes in laws or regulations that further impair the ability or desire of individuals to travel, including laws or regulations banning travel, requiring vaccination, COVID-19 testing requirements in connection with travel, the closure of hotels or other travel-related businesses (such as restaurants and spas) or other restrictions in connection with or as a result of the pandemic, may exacerbate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The ultimate extent of the pandemic and its impact on travel is unknown and difficult to predict. As a result, the full extent of the impact on our business and results of operations is unknown. The pandemic and the emergence of new variants, including Delta and Omicron, could continue to hamper global economic activity for an extended period of time, even as restrictions begin to lift or vaccination rates increase, leading to decreased disposable income for consumers, increased and ongoing unemployment and/or a decline in consumer confidence, all of which could significantly reduce discretionary spending on travel. In turn, that could have a negative impact on demand for our services. Although the increase in vaccination rates has allowed many countries to open their borders for travel again, there is inconsistency in testing, vaccination and safety protocols across countries, making trip planning unpredictable and undermining consumer confidence. Because we operate in various countries (including through our licensing arrangements), we are subject to varying rates of recovery and diverse restrictions and reactions to COVID-19 and vaccinations. The aforementioned circumstances could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, potentially for a prolonged period.\nImpairments of goodwill, long-term investments and long-lived assets have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAs a result of the deterioration of certain aspects of our business due to COVID-19, we evaluated goodwill, Intangible assets, long-term investments and long-lived assets for possible impairment as of March 31, 2020. We performed these impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of Jack\u2019s Flight Club net assets to the fair value of the Jack\u2019s Flight Club reporting unit based on an updated discounted cash flow analysis. We determined that our indefinite lived intangible assets (Trade names) and goodwill were impaired, and therefore we recognized an impairment charge of $2.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. We performed its annual impairment testing and determined that no additional impairment was necessary for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The determination of the fair value reflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value estimate. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the current forecast, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the global pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the impairment charge.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be profitable.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated consolidated net income of $902,000, of which $911,000 income was attributable to Travelzoo. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred consolidated net loss of $14.6 million, of which $13.4 million loss was attributable to Travelzoo. Our profitability was impacted in 2021 and 2020 due to the global pandemic, and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future. We forecast our future expense levels based on our operating plans and our estimates of future revenues. Given the impact of the pandemic in 2020, we significantly cut expenses to preserve profitability as much as possible. In the future, depending on various factors, including but not limited to, market conditions, the improvement of the economy and the return of the travel industry following the pandemic, we may need to continue to cut expenses to preserve profitability or alternatively we may find it necessary to significantly accelerate expenditures in order to meet increased demand or to maintain brand awareness. We may also expand and upgrade our technology and make investments in existing or new products that may impact our profitability. If our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate or decline, or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth, we may not generate sufficient revenues to be profitable.\nFluctuations in our operating results may negatively impact our stock price.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors that could affect our revenues or our expenses in any particular period. You should not rely on our quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations, as they are not considered an indication of future performance. Factors that may affect quarterly results include: consumer refund rate; mismatches between resource allocation and client demand due to difficulties in predicting client demand; changes in general economic conditions (perceived or actual) that could impair consumer spending; the magnitude and timing of marketing initiatives, including member acquisition and expansion efforts; the introduction, development, timing, competitive pricing and market acceptance of our products and services and those of our competitors; our ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel; our ability to maintain merchant and member satisfaction such that we are able to continue to attract high quality merchants and members; our ability to manage our planned growth; our ability to encourage our existing members to engage with our products and services and to convert them to revenue-generating users; technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet or our products and services; and volatility of our operating results in new markets.\nWe may significantly decrease our operating expenses in response to changes in general economic conditions, performance and/or declines in consumer demand. We may significantly increase our operating expenses for a certain period if, among other reasons, we see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign, if we find it necessary to respond to increased brand marketing by a competitor, or if we decide to accelerate our acquisition of new members or engagement of existing members. If revenues fall below our expectations in any quarter and we are unable to quickly reduce our operating expenses in response, our operating results would be lower than expected and our stock price may fall.\nExpansion of product offerings may result in additional costs that exceed revenue and may trigger additional stock volatility.\nIn response to the global pandemic, we expanded our voucher product offerings to include fully refundable vouchers. We have also historically invested in packaging technology and expansion of our hotel booking platform. We may in the future invest in the technology for our email products or invest in completely new products. Such product modifications and expansions may result in an increase in costs in the near-term and an increase in cost structure in the long-term, which may be in excess of incremental revenue. If our expanded product offerings are not embraced by our users or our advertising partners, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to monetize these initiatives, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. If we cannot attract members to our product offerings, including in the face of substantial uncertainty due to the pandemic, our financial results could be affected. Fully refundable vouchers may also result in significant refunds and costs for the Company. In addition, the hotel booking platform and travel packages will be sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and average daily rates and a fluctuation in any of these factors could impact our revenue. We can give no assurances that any of our product offerings will yield the benefits we expect and will not result in additional costs.\nOur voucher products may be adversely impacted by competition and decreased consumer demand for vouchers.\nOur Local Deals and Getaways products include the sale of vouchers directly to consumers to advertise promotional offers provided by merchants. This format may require additional investments to maintain and grow the business including the hiring of additional sales force and additional spend on customer service, marketing, technology tracking systems and payment processing. Such vouchers had been typically non-refundable or refundable by the Company within 7-14 days of purchase. In March 2020, the Company expanded its voucher products to include fully refundable vouchers, which allow the consumer to request a refund through the expiration date of the voucher. This shift has increased the rate at which our existing customers purchase vouchers. However, we cannot guarantee that this trend will continue. As market conditions continue to shift, we may see a decline in demand for vouchers or the Company may strategically move away from this product offering. Changing travel restrictions due to the global pandemic have made it so that many consumers may not be able to use their vouchers in the near-term or at all. Although we are actively working with our partners to extend travel windows and expiration dates to ensure\nconsumers can use their vouchers and while we are continually evolving our strategy, we may not always be successful in doing so and the demand for our vouchers may decline or refund rates may increase and may adversely impact revenues.\nOur business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms or other traffic-generating arrangements.\nWe utilize Internet search engines such as Google, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords and through organic search, to generate additional traffic to our websites. The number of users we attract from search engines to our websites is due in large part to how and where information from, and links to, our websites are displayed on search engine results pages. The display, including rankings, of unpaid search results can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our control and may change frequently. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the placement or cost of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on search engines, travel metasearch engines, and Internet media properties. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. Also, we may scale back our expenditures in paid search, pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns at any time. Moreover, a search or metasearch engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or display of results causing a website to place lower in search query results. This would adversely affect our business and financial performance, potentially to a material extent. We could also face a significant decrease in traffic to our websites and/or increased costs.\nAdditionally, an area of increased scrutiny, particularly in Europe, involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party\u2019s name). In some of our contracts we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, our performance marketing costs may increase if bidding on affected key words (especially those related to us) becomes more expensive, which could adversely affect our marketing efficiency and results of operations.\nTrends in consumer use of mobile devices continues to create challenges.\nContinued widespread use of mobile devices, such as the iPhone and Android-enabled smart phones, and tablets, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful \u201capps\u201d available on these devices, has been driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners have also seen a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile applications for travel products and other functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for hotel bookings and travel concierge services. Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes. The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than that earned from a typical desktop transaction due to different target consumers and different purchasing patterns. Further, given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smartphones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple applications from multiple travel service providers and instead prefer to use one or a limited number for their mobile travel activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile applications, as well as brand recognition and loyalty, are likely to become more important. We also rely on application marketplaces, or app stores, to drive downloads. In the future, marketplace operators may make changes that make access to our products more difficult.\nWe continue to make progress creating mobile offerings which have received strong reviews and have shown solid download trends. We believe that mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for growth. Further development of our mobile offerings is necessary to maintain and grow our business. As a result, it is increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile websites optimized for mobile devices. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile applications are not downloaded and used by travel consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a global company, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based tax, in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. With the election of President Biden, there could be additional\nchanges to the corporate tax rate in the near future. The interpretation and implementation of the Tax Act and regulations, rules or guidance that have or may be adopted under, or result from, the Tax Act could have a material impact on our business.\nA number of European Union member states have taken steps to unilaterally introduce a services tax. In July 2019, France passed legislation that introduced a 3% digital services tax, which is retroactively applicable as of January 1, 2019. Beginning in April 2020, the government of the United Kingdom implemented a digital services tax which imposes a 2% tax on revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces which derive value from UK users. Similarly, effective January 16, 2021, Spain will tax digital services at 3% for companies that operate globally and have a significant digital footprint in Spain. Many questions remain regarding these digital services taxes. For example, it is not clear whether digital services taxes can be deducted for income tax purposes or whether there is potential for double taxation on the same transaction. The interpretation and implementation of these taxes (especially if there is inconsistency in the application of these taxes across tax jurisdictions) could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as value-added, payroll, sales, use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, including for Jack\u2019s Flight Club. From time to time, the Company may by audited by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to its taxes or its net operating income or may result in recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.\nAdverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nOur expansion of our product offerings may subject us to state and local tax laws and result in additional tax liabilities. A number of jurisdictions in the U.S. have initiated lawsuits against other online travel companies, related to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes (i.e., state and local sales tax). In addition, a number of municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of such taxes. Given our hotel booking platform and packaging technology consist of an agency model whereby we will facilitate reservations on behalf of a hotel or other supplier, the payment of hotel occupancy taxes and other taxes should be the responsibility of the applicable hotel or packaging partner, which are typically responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the various tax authorities. Nevertheless, to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have a tax collection responsibility (for hotel bookings, packaging or any other aspects of our business, including Jack\u2019s Flight Club), or we determine that we have one, with respect to future transactions, we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost to our customers and, consequently, could make our services less competitive (i.e., versus the websites of other online travel companies or hotel company websites) and reduce reservation transactions. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business model may not be adaptable to a changing market.\nOur current revenue model depends primarily on advertising fees paid by travel and entertainment companies and still relies significantly on email communications with our members. If current clients/partners decide not to continue or are unable to continue advertising their offers with us and we are unable to replace them with new clients/partners or alternative revenue streams, our business may be adversely affected. To be successful, we must provide online marketing solutions that achieve broad market acceptance by travel and entertainment companies. In addition, we must attract sufficient Internet users with attractive demographic characteristics to our products. It is possible that we will be required to further adapt our business model and products in response to changes in the online advertising market or travel industry or if our current business model is not successful. For example, uncertainty surrounding the ability to travel would require us to adapt our product offerings to move away from our reliance on advertising fees and to provide consumers with additional flexibility in order to attract them to purchase. If we do not adapt to these trends fully or quickly enough, we may lose revenue as consumer usage of our products and services may decline. If we are not able to anticipate changes in the online advertising market or if our business model is not successful, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain existing advertisers or add new advertisers, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain advertisers that are prepared to offer products or services on compelling terms to our members. We do not generally have long-term arrangements to guarantee the availability of deals that offer attractive quality, value and variety to consumers or favorable payment terms to us. We must continue to attract and retain advertisers in order to increase revenue and maintain profitability. If new advertisers do not find our marketing and promotional services effective, or if existing advertisers do not believe that utilizing our products provides them with a long-term increase in customers, revenue or profit, they may stop making offers through our marketplace. In addition, we may experience attrition in our advertisers in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors and advertiser closures or bankruptcies/insolvencies. We can also experience a decline in advertisers providing offers in certain destinations due to natural disasters or travel restrictions. If we are unable to attract new advertisers in numbers sufficient to grow our\nbusiness, or if too many advertisers are unwilling to offer compelling terms to our members or favorable payment terms to us, we may sell less advertising, and our operating results will be adversely affected. We may not be able to add enough additional revenue to replace the lost revenue. Further, the new revenue may cost more to generate, impacting our operating results.\nA change in our estimate of our refund rates with respect to unredeemed vouchers could result in a change of our reported revenues and an increase in our refund rates could reduce our liquidity and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn order to adapt to the shift in consumer demand due to COVID-19, we modified our refund policy for Local Deals and Getaways vouchers to allow refunds through the expiration date of the voucher, which is typically at least 6-12 months from the date of purchase. Our previous policy allowed refunds for only 7 days after purchase with no limitations. According to accounting standards for revenue recognition, revenue that is subject to refunds or returns is considered variable consideration and must be constrained so that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as the uncertainty is resolved. To comply with this standard, we estimated future refunds and refund rates utilizing a sophisticated model that incorporates qualitative and quantitative factors, including but not limited to, historical refund rates based on deal category, relative risk of refund based on voucher type, and changing business and market conditions. However, due to constantly shifting market factors, particularly due to COVID-19, and limited historical data due to the recent change in policy, accurately predicting the refund rate is difficult, and we can make no guarantees that our estimates will be correct. If our refund estimates are materially understated, it will result in a reversal of revenues previously reported and we may be required to restate our financial statements for the relevant periods, which could damage our reputation and impact our stock price. Additionally, although revenues from voucher purchases may increase, due to the modified refund policy the refund rate may also increase, likely above historical levels, resulting in increased liabilities and a reduction in recognizable revenue and liquidity, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIf our advertisers do not meet the needs and expectations of our members, our business could suffer.\nOur business depends on our reputation for providing high-quality deals, and our brand and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by advertisers, partners, or merchants that are outside our control. For our Local Deals and Getaways merchants, since we are selling vouchers on behalf of the merchants directly to our members, we face exposure should merchants not fully honor the terms of the deals or the vouchers, including if the merchant were to go out of business or stop providing services for any reason. As for our travel business, we are collecting an advertising fee from the advertiser and the members are booking the deal directly with the advertiser. Although the advertiser is responsible directly to the consumer to provide the deal it advertised, our business can be adversely affected should an advertiser fail to comply with the terms of the advertised deal. From time to time, merchants and advertisers risk the insolvency, bankruptcy or closure of their business and can face regulatory issues (including losing their travel licenses), which can result in the cancellation of travel services booked by consumers through the advertiser. Advertisers who fail to fulfill the travel services advertised in the promotions ran by us can negatively impact our reputation, and advertisers that fail to pay for the advertisements can also negatively impact revenue growth. Moreover, any shortcomings of one or more of our advertisers or merchants, particularly with respect to an issue affecting the quality of the deal offered or the products or services sold, may be attributed by our members to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations. In addition, negative publicity and member sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by our merchants or partners could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new members or retain our current members, and diminish the value of our brand.\nOur business relies heavily on email and other messaging services, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or messages or a decrease in member willingness to receive messages could adversely affect our revenue and business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon email and other messaging services. Deals offered through emails and other messages sent by us, or on our behalf by our affiliates, generate a substantial portion of our revenue. Because of the importance of email and other messaging services, if we are unable to successfully deliver emails or messages, or if members decline to open our emails or messages, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Laws and regulations regulating the sending of commercial emails, including those enacted in foreign jurisdictions (such as Canada and Europe), may affect our ability to deliver emails or messages and may also result in increased compliance costs. Further, actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of emails or other messages could also materially and adversely impact our business. From time to time, Internet service providers block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails or other messages to third parties. In addition, our use of email and other messaging services to send communications about our website or other matters may result in legal claims against us, which if successful might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or other messages. Any disruption or restriction on the distribution of emails or other messages or any increase in the associated costs would materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability. In addition, the shift in our website traffic originating from mobile devices accessing our services may decrease our members' willingness to use our services and could decrease their willingness to be an email member.\n\u201cCookie\u201d laws could negatively impact the way we do business.\nA \"cookie\" is a text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device. Cookies are common tools used by thousands of websites and mobile apps to, among other things, store or gather information (e.g., remember log-on details), market to consumers and enhance the user experience. Cookies are valuable tools to improve the customer experience and increase conversion. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union and more recently, California, have adopted regulations governing the use of \"cookies.\" To the extent any such regulations require \"opt-in\" consent before certain cookies can be placed on a user's computer or mobile device, our ability to serve certain customers in the manner we currently do might be adversely affected and our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our website might be impaired, either of which could negatively affect a consumer's experience using our services and our business, market share and results of operations.\nOur reported total number of members may be higher than the number of our actual individual members and may not be representative of the number of persons who are active potential customers.\nThe total number of members we report may be higher than the number of our actual individual members because some members have multiple registrations, other members have died or become incapacitated and others may have registered under fictitious names. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these members, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual individual members, and thus we rely on the number of total members shown on our records as our measure of the size of our member base. In addition, the number of members we report includes the total number of individuals that have completed registration through a specific date, less individuals who have unsubscribed. Those numbers of members may include individuals who do not receive our emails because our emails have been blocked or are otherwise undeliverable. As a result, the reported number of members should not be considered as representative of the number of persons who continue to actively consider our deals by reviewing our email offers.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to grow our business and equity or debt financing may be on adverse terms.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents was $43.8 million, of which $24.0 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had negative working capital of $22.8 million. Merchant payables was $68.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The payable to merchants is generally due upon redemption of the voucher. The vouchers have maturities that extend from January 2022 through December 2025 with the majority of vouchers expiring in 2022 and the remaining primarily expiring in 2023; provided, that these expiration dates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis. However, if redemption and refund activities are more accelerated, or if we are not able to reduce operating losses, we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our working capital needs in the future. We intend to continue to grow our business and fund our current operations using cash on hand. However, this may not be sufficient to meet our needs, including the payments required to settle merchant payables and various commitments and contingencies, as described under Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, especially due to volatile market conditions. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our strategic objectives, meet our payroll obligations, successfully promote our brand, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we choose to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and holders of the additional equity securities may have rights senior to existing stockholders of our common stock. If we obtain additional financing through debt securities, the terms of these arrangements could restrict or prevent us from paying dividends, could require the pledging of assets, could subject the Company to restrictive covenants or large fees, and could limit our flexibility.\nUtilization of governmental stimulus packages may negatively impact our business, operations and/or reputation.\nCertain governments have passed legislation to help businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic with loans, wage subsidies, tax relief or other financial aid. We are participating in, or have applied to participate in, several government programs, including but not limited to, the programs offered in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and certain other jurisdictions. To the extent we do receive any assistance (in the form of government sponsored or private loans), we may be required to agree to certain restrictions, including but not limited to negative covenants, which could impact how we operate and negatively impact the business, as well as result in higher financing costs. Our reputation could also be harmed.\nOur business may be sensitive to recessions or events effecting the travel industry generally.\nThe demand for online advertising may be linked to the level of economic activity and employment in the U.S. and abroad. Specifically, our business is primarily dependent on the demand for online advertising from travel and entertainment companies. Events like Middle East conflicts, terrorist attacks, mass shooting incidents, natural disasters, and travel-related health events, such as the pandemic, have a negative impact on the travel industry and affect travelers\u2019 behavior by limiting\ntheir ability or willingness to visit certain locations. In addition, advertisers may choose to limit advertising spend on certain destinations, which can adversely impact our business. We are not in a position to evaluate the net effect of these circumstances as these events are largely unpredictable; however, we believe there has been negative impact to our business by such events. In the longer term, our business might be negatively affected by financial pressures on or changes to the travel industry.\nOur operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nOur operations are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, unexpected technical problems in the systems that power our websites and distribute our email newsletters, break-ins and similar events. Outages could cause significant interruptions of our service. In addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, and although we have moved most of our IT operations to the cloud, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. We do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events.\nWe are subject to payments-related and fraud risks.\nWe accept payments for the sale of vouchers using a variety of methods, including credit cards and debit cards. We pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating expenses and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. Because the global pandemic has increased the risk profile of travel-related companies, such payment processing services may require larger deposits, impose stricter rules or requirements, or may decide to stop working with companies related to the travel industry altogether. For example, Travelzoo was required to change processors in certain jurisdictions in 2021 because its previous processor decided to stop working with companies related to the travel industry. If we are unable to pivot to a new payment processor quickly, this could lead to periods of time where we are unable to accept or process payments from our members, impacting our ability to generate revenue. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers and regulations for electronic payment services, such as PSD2 in Europe, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. In addition, our results can be negatively impacted by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards. Because we act as the merchant of record for certain transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites as well as other payment disputes with our customers. If we have an increase of charge-backs due to the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a security breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. If one or more of these contracts are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms, or at all, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply.\nUnited States generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or (\"FASB\"), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition which changed the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoptions resulted in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings and changes in revenue recognition policies. In 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard related to leases which requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability on its balance sheet. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 842 on January 1, 2019, using the alternative modified transition method with no restatement of prior periods or cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. We may need to change our accounting processes if we are required to adopt future or proposed changes in principles. The cost of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.\nRisks Related to Our Markets and Strategy\nOur international operations may result in operating losses and are subject to other material risks.\nWe may continue to invest in marketing as well as additional employees to support our operations (including licensing arrangements), which may generate operating losses. Furthermore, operating losses in certain jurisdictions may not have any recognizable tax benefit. These factors could have a material negative impact on our consolidated net income and cash flows,\nwhich could result in a significant decrease in the trading price of our common stock. There are certain additional risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions; uncertainty regarding how the wider trading, legal, regulatory and labor environments will be impacted by Brexit, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients; exposure to local economic or political instability and threatened or actual acts of terrorism; compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption, antitrust or competition, economic sanctions, data privacy, consumer protection, employment and labor laws, health and safety, information reporting and advertising and promotions; financial risks from transactions in multiple currencies; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; trade barriers and changes in trade regulations, including new or increased tariffs; difficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language and cultural differences; stringent local labor laws and regulations; bans on travel among or between various countries; risks related to government regulation, including changing policies in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, and healthcare, among others; and potentially adverse tax consequences. Moreover, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact our revenues. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar have negatively impacted our revenues from our operations in Europe. The uncertainty and volatility in foreign exchange rates, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, a decline in the growth rates of our international businesses could have a negative impact on our gross profit and earnings per share growth rates and, as a consequence, our stock price. Many of these regions have different customs, currencies, levels of consumer acceptance and use of the Internet for commerce, legislation, regulatory environments, tax laws and levels of political stability. International markets may have strong local competitors with an established brand that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated. In addition, compliance with legal, regulatory or tax requirements in multiple jurisdictions places demands on our time and resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences. As we continue to focus on increasing the profitability of our business, we may not achieve targeted operational cost savings, improvements and efficiencies, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant potential risks could impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions throughout the organization, including, but not limited to, higher than anticipated costs, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures, and damage to our reputation and brand image. Additionally, we could also experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, adverse effects on employee morale and productivity and adverse effects on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to continue developing awareness of our brand names.\nWe believe that continuing to build awareness of the Travelzoo and Jack\u2019s Flight Club brand names is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our business. Brand recognition is a key differentiating factor among providers of online advertising opportunities, and we believe it could become more important as competition in our industry increases. In order to maintain and build brand awareness, we must succeed in our marketing efforts. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand consistently across numerous jurisdictions, incur significant expenses in promoting our brands and fail to generate a corresponding increase in revenue as a result of our branding efforts, or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand names, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing members or acquire new members, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe spent $2.9 million and $1.6 million on marketing initiatives relating to member acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and expect to subside, to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire members. Our long-term success depends on our continued ability to increase the overall number of members and engage those members. We cannot assure you that the revenue from members we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring new members. If members do not perceive our offers to be of high value and quality or if we fail to introduce new and more relevant deals, we may not be able to acquire or retain members. If we reduce our member acquisition costs, we cannot assure you that this will not adversely impact our ability to acquire new members. If we are unable to acquire new members who purchase our deals in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if members cease to purchase our deals, the revenue we generate may decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected. If the level of usage by our member base declines or does not grow as expected, we may suffer a decline in member growth or revenue. A significant decrease in the level of usage or member growth would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract travel and entertainment companies or Internet users if we do not continually enhance and develop the content and features of our products and services.\nTo remain competitive, we must continually improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of our products and services. We may not succeed in developing features, functions, products, or services that travel and entertainment companies and Internet users find attractive. Our current technology may not meet the future technical requirements of travel and entertainment companies. This could reduce the number of travel and entertainment companies and Internet users using our products and materially adversely affect our business. We are also continually looking to refine our product offerings. We cannot guarantee that any such refinements will be embraced by our members. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. While we are striving to improve functionality, usability and design in our products, the ongoing enhancements on web and mobile and investment in packaging and other technology may not achieve the desired results we anticipate, and if unsuccessful, could result in a decline in revenues, an increase in costs, and a negative impact on our business.\nOur business and growth will suffer if we are unable to hire and retain highly skilled personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees. We may be unable to retain our skilled employees, or attract, assimilate, and retain other highly skilled employees in the future. We have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we are unable to hire and retain skilled personnel, our growth may be restricted, which could adversely affect our future success. Additionally, the loss or departure of any of our key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any member of our management team. We also expect new members to join our management team in the future. If our key management personnel are not able to work together effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIntense competition may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably.\nThe markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. We compete for advertising dollars with large Internet portal sites, such as Trip Advisor, that offer listings or other advertising opportunities to travel, entertainment and local businesses. These companies have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger advertiser bases. We compete with companies like Groupon that sell vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants and tour operators for vacation packages. We compete with search engines like Google that offer pay-per-click listings. Additionally, certain search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products. For example, Google has continued to add features and functionality to its flight and hotel metasearch products, which have grown rapidly and has also further integrated its \u201cBook on Google\u201d reservation functionality into its products. We compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that operate websites which provide online advertising opportunities. We compete with travel metasearch engines like Kayak.com (owned by Booking Holdings) and online travel and entertainment deal publishers (including online restaurant reservation services). We compete with large online travel agencies like the Expedia Group and Booking Holdings, as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world, that also offer advertising placements and hotel booking platforms and capture consumer interest. There has been substantial consolidation of the global travel industry and we believe this trend will continue. Some of our competitors are large and have significant resources and substantial international operations. Such companies have also completed acquisitions to further consolidate the industry.\nThere has also been a proliferation of new channels and platforms through which accommodation providers can offer reservations. For example, companies such as Airbnb (which acquired HotelTonight), HomeAway and VRBO (which are both owned by Expedia Group) offer services providing alternative accommodation property owners, particularly individuals, an online place to list their alternative accommodations, which compete with our hotel offers. Further, meta-search services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant's brand to drive consumers directly to its website. Some competitors offer a variety of online services, such as food delivery, shopping, gaming or search services, many of which are used by consumers more frequently than online travel services. As a result, a competitor that has established other, more frequent online interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its travel services than we can. If any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to consumers who would otherwise use our platforms or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs could increase, either of which would harm our business and results of operations. We also have seen that some competitors will accept lower margins, or negative margins, to attract attention and acquire new members. If competitors engage in group buying initiatives in which merchants receive a higher percentage of the face value than we currently offer, we may be forced to pay a higher percentage of the face value than we currently offer, which may reduce our revenue. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies, including print media companies, enter the online advertising\nmarket. Competition could result in reduced margins on our services, loss of market share or less use of Travelzoo by advertisers and consumers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to access third-party technology upon which we depend.\nWe use data technology and software products from third parties (such as hosting and cloud services), and technology from our vendors may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our business will suffer if we are unable to access technology, to gain access to additional products or to integrate new technology with our existing systems. This could cause delays in our development and introduction of new services and related products or enhancements of existing products until equivalent or replacement technology can be accessed, if available, or developed internally, if feasible. If we experience these delays, our business could be materially adversely affected. We also rely on certain third-party computer systems and third party service providers, including Global Distribution Systems and computerized central reservation systems, in connection with providing certain of our hotel booking services and travel package offerings. Any interruption in these services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from utilizing certain booking services and have an adverse effect on our business, brands and results of operations. Our agreements with some third-party service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions.\nAcquisitions, investments, licensing arrangements and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, and other assets, as well as strategic investments, licensing arrangements and joint ventures. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.\nThese transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including: diversion of management time; implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other systems, and coordination of various functions; transition of operations, users, and customers onto our platforms, if applicable; failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected goals of an acquisition; the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, legal, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; failure to successfully develop the acquired business or technology; liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties; challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts; expected and unexpected costs incurred in pursuing acquisitions, including identifying and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful; entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior experience and increased complexity in our business; inability to sell disposed assets or impairment of investments, goodwill and other assets acquired or divested; the need to obtain financial and other information regarding the investee in order to properly account and report for the investment on an on-going basis; and failure to secure necessary financing in order to complete a purchase or applicable transaction. Future acquisitions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. As licensing arrangements typically involve third parties unrelated to the Company operating under our brand name in foreign jurisdictions, we risk, among other things, damage to our reputation or brand image if such third parties are unsuccessful or behave in a way that is contrary to Travelzoo.\nRisks Related to Legal Uncertainty\nWe may become subject to shareholder lawsuits over securities violations due to volatile stock price.\nShareholder lawsuits for securities violations are often launched against companies whose stock price is volatile. Such lawsuits involving the Company would require management\u2019s attention to defend, which may distract attention from operating the Company. In addition, even if the lawsuit is meritless, the Company may incur substantial costs to defend itself and/or settle such claims, to minimize the distraction and costs of defense. Such lawsuits could result in judgments against the Company requiring substantial payments to claimants. Such costs may materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of employment, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, intellectual property, tax, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy, anti-competition, health and safety, and vacation packaging. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the costs of compliance and doing business. For example, the Company and Jack\u2019s Flight Club employ employees and engage contractors in various countries and therefore could be subject to misclassification or tax claims related to such arrangements or increased costs to ensure continued compliance as both companies grow and add to their workforce. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u2019s services less attractive, delay the introduction of new products, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices or incur more costs to comply or defend itself. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures.\nThe CARD Act and similar state and foreign laws may harm our Local Deals and Getaways business.\nVouchers may be considered gift cards, gift certificates, stored value cards or prepaid cards (\u201cgift cards\u201d) and therefore governed by, among other laws, the Credit Card Act of 2009 (the \u201cCARD Act\u201d), and state laws governing gift cards. Other foreign jurisdictions have similar laws in place, in particular European jurisdictions where the European E-Money Directive regulates the business of electronic money institutions. Many of these laws contain provisions governing the use of gift cards, including specific disclosure requirements and prohibitions or limitations on the use of expiration dates and the imposition of certain fees. Purported class actions against other companies have been filed claiming that coupons similar to the vouchers are subject to the CARD Act and various state laws governing gift cards and that the defendants have violated these laws by issuing the coupons with expiration dates and other restrictions. In addition, investigations by certain state attorney general offices have been launched against other companies with regards to similar issues. If similar claims are asserted against the Company in respect of the Local Deals and Getaways vouchers and are successful, we may become subject to fines and penalties and incur additional costs. In addition, if federal or state laws require that the face value of our vouchers have a minimum expiration period beyond the period desired by a merchant for its promotional program, or no expiration period, this may affect the willingness of merchants to issue vouchers in jurisdictions where these laws apply. For unredeemed vouchers, similar laws in other jurisdictions require us or merchants to honor the face value of vouchers sold, after the redemption period. Such developments may materially and adversely affect the profitability or viability of our Local Deals and Getaways vouchers.\nCertain gift card laws could require us to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements and our operating result could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn certain states and foreign jurisdictions, our vouchers may be considered gift cards. Some of these states and foreign jurisdictions include gift cards under their unclaimed and abandoned property laws which require companies to remit to the government the value of the unredeemed balance on the gift cards after a specified period of time (generally between 1 and 5 years) and impose certain reporting and record keeping obligations. The analysis of the potential application of the unclaimed and abandoned property laws to our vouchers is complex, involving an analysis of constitutional and statutory provisions and factual issues, including our relationship with members and merchants and our role as it relates to the issuance and delivery of a voucher. In the event that one or more jurisdictions successfully challenges our position on the application of its laws to vouchers, or if the estimates that we use in projecting the likelihood of vouchers being redeemed prove to be inaccurate, our liabilities with respect to unredeemed vouchers may be materially higher than the amounts shown in our financial statements. If we are required to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements, our net income could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, a successful challenge to our position could subject us to penalties or interest, and any such penalties or interest would have a further material adverse impact on our net income.\nTax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce may adversely affect the use of our services and our results.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our members to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of any attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, Valued Added Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the\nSouth Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. sales tax nexus case and as a result, states now have the ability to adopt laws requiring taxpayers to collect and remit sales tax on a basis of economic nexus, even in states in which the taxpayer has no presence. For example, due to media sales for travel agents, clients or partners in certain states with economic nexus provisions (including but not limited to New Mexico, South Dakota, West Virginia and Hawaii), we could have potential tax exposure pursuant to the Wayfair decision. We are continuing to evaluate states and countries where we could have such exposure, including for the operations of Jack\u2019s Flight Club. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may suffer liability as a result of information transmitted over the Internet and claims related to our service offerings.\nWe may be sued for defamation, civil rights infringement, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy, personal injury, product liability, breach of contract, unfair competition, discrimination, violations of disability laws, antitrust or other legal claims relating to information that is published or made available on our websites or service offerings we make available. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services companies in the past. The fact that we distribute information via email may subject us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email or spamming, lost or misdirected messages, security breaches, illegal or fraudulent use of email or interruptions or delays in email or mobile service. These risks are enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., where our liability for such third-party actions may be less clear and we may be less protected. In addition, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims, even if we ultimately are not found liable. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our websites and applications, including content that is produced by our editorial staff and errors or omissions related to our product offerings. Such information, whether accurate or inaccurate, may result in our being sued, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, we may acquire personal or confidential information, including credit card information, from users of our websites and mobile applications, related to our Local Deals, Getaways and hotel booking platform. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce disclosure of sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks or to takeover customer accounts by using information obtained elsewhere to attempt to login to customer accounts on our websites. A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information. A security breach at any travel service provider, hotel, payment processor, GDS or other third-party travel supplier could result in negative publicity and exposure.\nWhile we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly evolving. Consequently, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. We have experienced and responded to cyberattacks, which we believe have not had a significant impact on the integrity of our systems or the security of any data maintained by us. Security breaches or the unauthorized disclosure of customer personal information could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or our service providers, to comply with any privacy-related obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against the Company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our members to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nWe could also be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, which creates new data privacy rights for users effective in 2020, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield, which now requires that the transfer of information between the EU and the US be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. There are a number of proposals for enactment or modification of data privacy laws pending or proposed in other jurisdictions. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. To the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on the Company or require changes to the Company's business practices, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nClaims have been asserted against us relating to shares not issued in our 2002 merger.\nThe Company was formed as a result of a combination and merger of entities founded by the Company\u2019s principal stockholder, Ralph Bartel. In 2002, Travelzoo.com Corporation (\u201cNetsurfers\u201d) was merged into Travelzoo. Under and subject to the terms of the merger agreement, holders of promotional shares of Netsurfers who established that they had satisfied certain prerequisite qualifications were allowed a period of 2 years following the effective date of the merger to receive one share of Travelzoo in exchange for each share of common stock of Netsurfers. In 2004, 2 years following the effective date of the merger, certain promotional shares remained unexchanged. As the right to exchange these promotional shares expired, no additional shares were reserved for issuance. Thereafter, the Company began to offer a voluntary cash program for those who established that they had satisfied certain prerequisite qualifications for Netsurfer promotional shares. Beginning in 2010, the Company became subject to unclaimed property audits of various states in the U.S. related to the unexchanged promotional shares. Although the Company has settled the claims with all states, the Company may still receive inquiries from certain potential Netsurfer promotional stockholders that had not provided their state of residence to the Company. Therefore, the Company is continuing its voluntary program under which it makes cash payments to individuals related to the promotional shares for individuals whose residence was unknown by the Company and who establish that they satisfy the original conditions required for them to receive shares of Netsurfers, and who failed to submit requests to convert their shares into shares of Travelzoo within the required time period. The Company did not make any material payments under this voluntary program in 2021 and 2020. The total cost of this voluntary program is not reliably estimable because it is based on the ultimate number of valid requests received and future levels of the Company\u2019s common stock price.\nFederal laws and regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act and similar foreign laws, could be expanded to include Local Deals and Getaways vouchers.\nVarious federal laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act and foreign laws and regulations, such as the European Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. For these purposes, financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers and providers of prepaid access cards. Examples of anti-money laundering requirements imposed on financial institutions include customer identification and verification programs, suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting. We do not believe that we are a financial institution subject to these regulations based, in part, upon the closed loop nature and other characteristics of vouchers and our role with respect to the distribution of vouchers to members. However, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network previously issued final rules regarding the scope and requirements for non-bank parties involved in stored value or prepaid access cards, including obligations on sellers or providers of \u201cprepaid access\u201d. Under the final rule, providers or sellers of closed loop vouchers, such as those offered through the Local Deals and Getaways programs, would only be subject to registration if the vouchers exceed $2,000 in total value or if they are sold in aggregate amounts exceeding $10,000 to any single person in one day. Should the $2,000 limit be exceeded or should more than $10,000 in aggregate vouchers be sold to any individual person (sales to businesses for resale or distribution are excluded) then we may be deemed either a seller or provider of prepaid access subject to regulation. In the event that we become subject to these requirements or any other anti-money laundering law or regulation imposing obligations on us as a money services business, our regulatory compliance costs to meet these obligations would likely increase which could reduce our net income. In addition, the costs for third parties to sell vouchers would increase, which may restrict our ability to enlist third parties to issue vouchers.\nState and foreign laws regulating money transmission could be expanded to include Travelzoo vouchers or other Travelzoo products or services.\nMany states and certain foreign jurisdictions impose license and registration obligations on those companies engaged in the business of money transmission, with varying definitions of what constitutes money transmission. We currently believe that we are not a money transmitter given our role and the product terms of Travelzoo vouchers or other Travelzoo products or services. However, a successful challenge to our position or expansion of state or foreign laws could subject us to increased compliance costs and delay our ability to offer our products or services in certain jurisdictions pending receipt of any necessary licenses.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective which could impact our business.\nThe SEC approved amendments in 2018 that raised the cap for status as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. Travelzoo qualified as a smaller reporting company in 2020 meaning it is not subject to the SOX 404(b) requirement of having an auditor attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. However, we may be obligated to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting if we are no longer smaller reporting company and we may identify areas of internal control that may\nneed improvement or require remediation efforts. Currently, none of our identified areas that need improvement have been categorized as material weaknesses. We may identify conditions that may result in material weaknesses in the future.\nWe may be unable to protect our registered trademark or other proprietary intellectual property rights and may face liability from intellectual property litigation.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of the Travelzoo brand name. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights. The steps we have taken to protect our IP rights, however, may not always succeed in deterring misappropriation of proprietary information. We have registered the Travelzoo trademark in various jurisdictions. If we are unable to protect our rights in the mark, a key element of our strategy of promoting Travelzoo as a brand could be disrupted and our business could be adversely affected. We may not always be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our IP rights. In addition, the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of IP in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The laws of countries in which we may market our services in the future are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our IP. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology and brand name without paying us. If this were to occur, our business could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our products, content and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, copyrights or other IP rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the IP of others in the ordinary course of business. We may incur substantial expenses in defending against these claims, regardless of their merit. Successful claims against us may result in monetary liability or a material disruption of our business. We endeavor to defend our IP rights diligently, but litigation is expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resources from our business objectives. Resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to use IP rights, which may be expensive to procure.\nRisks Related to Investment in our Shares\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the closing price of our common stock on NASDAQ ranged from $8.71 to $18.34. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results; announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions; the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; stockholder collateral arrangements, and cash requirement on funds or stockholders that result in stockholder trades. There are several products offered in the market that allow stockholders to hedge stock, pledge their stock for collateral or engage in short selling, which can negatively impact the price of our stock. The Company does not prohibit stockholder hedging or pledging arrangements but does have strict policies against trading with material non-public information. Our stock price may be volatile given that operating results may vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which are beyond our control. In the event that our operating results fall below expectations, the trading price of our common shares may decline significantly. Moreover, fluctuations in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, such as a recession, acts of war (e.g., the conflict in Ukraine), interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, political instability (e.g., Brexit), changes in trade policy, trade disputes or a natural disaster, health concerns such as COVID or a terrorist attack affecting a significant market for our business may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock in connection with merger and acquisition activities.\nWe have a principal stockholder.\nRalph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo and who is a Director of the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro. As of December 31, 2021, Mr. Bartel is the Company's largest stockholder, holding approximately 41% of the Company's outstanding shares.\nAs a result of Mr. Bartel\u2019s ownership interests and voting power, Mr. Bartel is in a position to influence, and potentially control, significant corporate actions, including corporate transactions such as mergers, business combinations or dispositions of assets. This concentrated ownership position could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to Travelzoo stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89941, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TZOO"}
