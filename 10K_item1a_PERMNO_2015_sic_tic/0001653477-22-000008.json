{"cik": "1653477", "company": "Ingevity Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBased on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting the Company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline.\nOperational and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and financial results. Our facilities, as well as the operations of our suppliers, customers and third-party sales representatives and distributors, have been, and continue to be, disrupted by governmental and private sector responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, without limitation, government shutdown requirements, business shutdowns, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, travel or health-related restrictions, quarantines, self-isolations, and disruptions to transportation channels. These types of disruptions, or an outbreak among the employees in any of our facilities, could cause significant interruptions to, or temporary closures of, our operations and could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations. Working remotely may eventually lead to inefficiencies, as well as technology and security risks. Additionally, we are uncertain if the extended period during which our employees are unable to travel to our facilities or those of our customers and suppliers may negatively impact our business.\nDisruptions to the operations of our suppliers have at times, and may again, negatively impact our ability to purchase goods and services for our business at efficient prices and in sufficient amounts. Additionally, the operations of our customers have been, and could be further, disrupted, which can result in customers attempting to delay or cancel orders, reduce future orders or seek extended payment terms. Furthermore, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, adverse changes in the industries that our products serve or adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers could further adversely impact demand for our products, particularly in the automotive industry and industrial and consumer applications. The extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have on our business and financial results will depend on various uncertainties and future developments, including the ultimate duration, severity and spread of the virus and any new variants in the countries where we operate and transact business, subsequent government actions, and the resulting economic impacts.\nAdverse conditions in the automotive market have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our automotive carbon products.\nSales of our automotive activated carbon products are tied to global automobile production levels. Automotive production in the markets we serve can be affected by macro-economic factors such as interest rates, fuel prices, shifts in vehicle mix (including shifts toward alternative energy vehicles), consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory and legislative oversight requirements and trade agreements. For example, during the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in vehicle production and vehicles sales were negatively impacted by government shutdown orders and stay-at-home directives. Additionally, microchip shortages during 2021 have resulted in reduced vehicle production and, as a result, vehicle sales, and our operating results, have been negatively impacted. We currently anticipate this negative impact to continue throughout 2022.\nThe Company\u2019s pavement technologies product line is heavily dependent on government infrastructure spending.\nA significant portion of our customers\u2019 revenues in our pavement technologies business is derived from contracts with various foreign and U.S. governmental agencies, and therefore, when government spending is reduced, our customers\u2019 demand for our products is similarly reduced. While we do not do business directly with governmental agencies, our customers provide paving services to, for example, the governments of various jurisdictions within North America, South America, Europe, China, Brazil and India, and revenue either directly or indirectly attributable to such government spending continues to remain a\nsignificant portion of our revenues. Government business is, in general, subject to special risks and challenges, including: delays in funding and uncertainty regarding the allocation of funds to federal, state and local agencies; delays in spending or reductions in other state and local funding dedicated for transportation projects; other government budgetary constraints, cutbacks, delays or reallocation of government funding; long purchase cycles or approval processes; our customers\u2019 competitive bidding and qualification requirements; changes in government policies and political agendas; and international conflicts or other military operations that could cause the temporary or permanent diversion of government funding from transportation or other infrastructure projects.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are sold into cyclical end-markets, such as the automotive market and the apparel market, which are impacted by changes in consumer and industrial demand.\nCertain of our products are sold into end-markets that are cyclical and subject to frequent and rapid technology changes, changes in consumer preferences, evolving standards, and changes in product supply and demand. For example, demand for our engineered polymers products in the automotive market, where our products are formulated into automotive resins and coatings and various components, may be affected by technological advances, changing automotive OEM specifications and global automobile production levels. In the footwear market, demand for our engineered polymers products, where our products are sold into footwear adhesives, may be affected by consumer discretionary spending and changes in consumer preferences. Additionally, sales of our industrial specialties products may be negatively impacted due to reduced global industrial demand. The impact of these changes may lead to increased competition from competing and substitute products and downward pricing pressures on our customers, and therefore, our engineered polymers and industrial specialties product offerings.\nWe face competition from new technologies and new or emerging competitors.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets, to swiftly identify and respond to disruptive technologies, and to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving or disruptive technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the Performance Materials segment, there is competition from other activated carbon manufacturers. These competitors are trying to develop more advanced and alternative activated carbon products that could more effectively compete with our products in automotive applications. There is also competition in the automotive applications from non-activated carbon competitors and product offerings. For example, multiple OEMs are using sealed tanks in certain subsets of their vehicles to comply with the Tier 3/LEV III regulations in the U.S. While sealed tank fuel systems generally require an increased sized pelleted activated carbon canister to deal with refueling emissions, in most cases, they do not use an extruded honeycomb to meet current U.S. and California regulations. There is also emerging competition in the \"honeycomb\" space, which may impact sales of the Company's products. If a competitor were to succeed in developing products that are better suited than ours for automotive evaporative emissions capture applications and/or a competitive technology, such as, but not limited to, sealed gas tanks, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the adoption of electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is increasing in the U.S. and other parts of the world. Consumer demand for these alternative vehicles is expected to continue to increase significantly in future years as certain states and international governments implement limits on the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines with targets to completely phase out sales of such vehicles by as early as 2030. A reduction in the sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines would reduce demand for our activated carbon automotive products. Our long-term strategy is to grow our sales of products for applications in all-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to off-set the expected decline in activated carbon sales for internal combustion engines. If we are unable to develop products for all-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or grow sales fast enough, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. The process of designing and developing new technology and related products is complex, costly and uncertain and may require us to retain and recruit talent in areas of expertise outside of our current core competencies. There can be no assurance that such advances in technology will be feasible or will occur in a timely and efficient manner.\nCertain of our products face competition from substitute products where the costs of different raw material inputs can impact the price competitiveness of our products and negatively impact our sales and/or profits as we respond to substitute product competition.\nGum rosin-based products and hydrocarbon resins compete with our TOR-based resins in the adhesives and printing inks markets. The price of gum rosin has a significant impact on the market price for TOR and rosin derivatives and is driven by labor rates for harvesting, land leasing costs and various other factors that are not within our control. Hydrocarbon resins, for example, C5 resins, are co-products from the manufacture of isoprene (synthetic rubber). Availability and pricing are determined by the supply/demand dynamics for synthetic rubber as well as the price of crude oil as the feedstock for isoprene and various other factors that are not within our control. Animal and vegetable-based fatty acids compete with TOFA products in lubricant and industrial specialties. The market price for TOFA products is impacted by the prices of other fats and oils, and the prices for other fats and oils are driven by actual and expected harvest rates, petroleum oil prices and the biofuel market. Other monomers, thermoplastics and polyols compete with our caprolactone based products. The price for our products is impacted by the prices of competitive substitutes which are influenced by oil prices as well as other supply and demand factors. We may not be able to pass through raw material cost increases, or we may lose market share if we do not effectively manage our pricing, which in either case could negatively impact our financial results.\nAdditionally, the price of energy may directly or indirectly impact demand, pricing or profitability for certain of our products. As petroleum oil prices can change rapidly, Ingevity products may be disadvantaged due to the fact that CTO and BLSS are thinly traded commodities with pricing commonly established for periods ranging from one quarter to one-year periods of time. Due to this, alternative technologies which compete with product offerings provided by Ingevity may be advantaged from time to time in the marketplace. Protracted periods of high volatility or sustained oversupply of petroleum oil may also translate into increased competition from petroleum-based alternatives. In addition, pricing for competing naturally derived oils such as palm or soybean is likely to put further pressure on pricing of the Company\u2019s products during periods of depressed petroleum prices.\nDisruptions at any of our facilities could negatively impact our production, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to any of our manufacturing operations or other facilities, due to natural disasters and extreme weather, such as a hurricane, tropical storm, earthquake, tornado, severe weather, flood, fire or other unanticipated problems such as labor difficulties, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), equipment failure, cyberattacks or other cybersecurity incidents, capacity expansion difficulties or unscheduled maintenance, could cause operational disruptions of varied duration. Also, many of our production employees are governed by collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d). At our Covington, Virginia Performance Materials' manufacturing facility, the CBA expired on December 1, 2021. The parties are operating under the expired CBA while negotiations continue. While the Company has generally positive relations with its labor unions, there is no guarantee the Company will be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages, labor difficulties or unfavorable terms. In addition, existing CBAs may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the applicable plant.\nThese types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to varying degrees depending upon the facility, the duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative sources of manufacturing capacity. Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles. In certain cases, we have products, such as our extruded honeycomb and caprolactone products, that are only made at one facility. While we have some redundancies within the facilities that are the sole manufacturer of certain products, we have limited ability to make these products at other facilities.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the provision of certain critical operating services at several of our facilities.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the provision of certain critical operating services, primarily utilities and related services (e.g., steam, compressed air, energy, water, wastewater treatment) at our Covington, Virginia Performance Materials facility and at the following Performance Chemicals facilities: Crossett, Arkansas; North Charleston, South Carolina; and Warrington, UK. We have existing long-term contractual arrangements covering these services. The provision of these services would be at risk if any of the counterparties were to idle or permanently shut down the associated mill, or if operations at the associated mill were disrupted due to natural or other disaster, or by reason of strikes or other labor disruptions, or if there were a significant contractual dispute between the parties.\nIn the event that the applicable counterparty were to fail to provide the contracted services, we would be required to obtain these services from other third parties, most likely at an increased cost, or to expend capital to provide these services ourselves. The expenses associated with obtaining or providing these services, as well as any interruption in our operations as a result of the failure of the counterparty to provide these services, may be significant and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, in the event that WestRock\u2019s Covington, VA paper mill\u2019s wastewater treatment operations do not comply with permits or applicable law and WestRock is unable to determine the cause of such non-compliance, then we will be responsible for between 10 percent and 50 percent of the costs and expenses of such noncompliance (increasing in 10 percent increments per violation during each twelve month period) despite representing less than 3 percent of the total wastewater volume. These costs and expenses may be significant and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased. In the event we were to have a dispute with the landlord regarding the terms of the relevant lease agreements, or we were otherwise unable to fully access or utilize the leased property, the associated business disruption may be significant and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also dependent on third parties for the disposal of brine, which results from our own conversion of BLSS into CTO. If these service providers do not perform under their contracts, the costs of disposing of brine ourselves, including, for example, the transportation costs, could be significant.\nWe are dependent on certain large customers.\nWe have certain large customers in particular businesses, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the applicable segment\u2019s sales and, depending on the significance of the loss, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Sales to the Company\u2019s ten largest customers (across both segments) accounted for 32 percent of total sales for 2021. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total sales for 2021. With some exceptions, our business with those large customers is based primarily upon individual purchase orders. As such, our customers could cease buying our products from us at any time, for any reason, with little or no recourse. If a major customer or multiple smaller customers elected not to purchase products from us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nThe Company is dependent upon its production workers, as well as upon engineering, technical, sales and application specialists, together with experienced industry professionals and senior management. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Our failure to attract and retain individuals making significant contributions to our business could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to make or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and product lines or invest in joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, finance, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. There can be no assurances that these acquisitions or joint ventures will generate the expected value.\nAs we rely on information technologies to conduct our business, security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe rely on information technologies, some of which are managed by third parties, to manage the day-to-day operations and activities of our business, operate elements of our manufacturing facilities, manage our customer and vendor transactions, and maintain our financial, accounting and business records. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations.\nThe secure processing, maintenance and transmission of sensitive, confidential and personal data is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have instituted a system of security policies, procedures, capabilities, and internal controls designed to protect this information. Additionally, we engage third-party threat detection and monitoring services which includes a global cyber security incident response team and our auditor conducts periodic ISO 27001 gap assessments on our\ninformation technology systems. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, we may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, ransomware attacks, inadvertent or intentional employee actions, system failures and other risks that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data, improper use of our, or our third-party provider systems, solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, and operational disruptions. In addition, the global regulatory environment pertaining to information security and privacy is increasingly complex, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), and the China Cybersecurity Law. GDPR, which applies to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information of residents of European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) countries, mandates new compliance obligations, and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. CCPA requires companies to provide new data disclosure, access, deletion and opt-out rights to consumers in California. Implementing and complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise affect our business operations. Information security breaches, cyber incidents and disruptions, or failure to comply with laws and regulations related to information security or privacy, could result in legal claims or proceedings against us by governmental entities or individuals, significant fines, penalties or judgements, disruption of our operations, remediation requirements, changes to our business practices, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe are in the process of a complex, multi-year implementation of a new ERP system that is necessary due to the finite life of the existing operating system. The ERP system implementation requires the integration of the new ERP system with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes in order to maintain the accuracy of our books and records and to provide our management team with information important to the operation of our business. Such an initiative is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees. The implementation of the ERP system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated. Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively impacted.\nSupply Chain Risks\nDisruptions within our supply chain have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our production, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by disruptions within our supply chain and transportation network. Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship by third-party providers. The costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, extreme weather events, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Recently, the unprecedented congestion in ocean shipping has, and will continue to, adversely impact the reliability of our export shipments to customers and imports of raw materials, and transport driver shortages experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extended lead times for domestic shipments. Significant delays or increased costs relating to transportation could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions at our suppliers could lead to volatility or increases in raw material or energy costs and/or reduced availability of materials or energy, potentially affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Performance Chemicals segment is highly dependent on CTO as a raw material, which is limited in supply, and may be subject to price increases; changing supply and demand economics for CTO could limit access to sufficient supply and/or cause prices increases that we may be unable to pass through to customers\nThe availability of CTO is essential to our Performance Chemicals segment. Availability of CTO is directly linked to (as it is a co-product of) the production output of kraft mills using pine as their source of pulp, which is the predominant fiber source for packaging grades of paper as well as fluff pulp for personal care products. As a result, there is a finite global supply of CTO, with global demand for softwood pulp driving the global supply of CTO, rather than demand for CTO itself. Most of the CTO made available for sale by its producers in North America is covered by long-term supply agreements, further constraining availability.\nWe typically have long-term supply contracts for between 60-70 percent of our CTO requirements. We also enter into short term supply contracts and make spots purchases as necessary in order to ensure sufficient CTO supply. Effective January 1, 2022, WestRock notified us that it was removing a mill consisting of approximately 28,500 tons of CTO per year from our long-term supply agreement. Additionally, beginning in 2025, either party to the WestRock long-term supply agreement may provide a notice to the other party terminating the agreement five years from the date of such notice. Beginning one year after such notice, the quantity of products provided by WestRock under the agreement will be gradually reduced over a four-year period based on the schedule set forth in the agreement.\nIf any of our suppliers fail to meet their respective obligations under our supply agreements or we are otherwise unable to procure an adequate supply of CTO, including replacing the CTO volume associated with the removed WestRock mill, we would be unable to maintain our current level of production and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are other pressures on the availability of CTO. Some pulp or paper mills may choose to consume their production of CTO to meet their energy needs or reduce their carbon footprint rather than sell the CTO to third parties. Also, as described below, there are regulatory pressures that may incentivize suppliers of CTO to sell CTO into alternative fuel markets rather than to historical end users such as Ingevity. Furthermore, weather conditions have in the past and may in the future affect the availability and quality of pine trees used in the kraft pulping process and therefore, the availability of CTO meeting Ingevity\u2019s quality standards.\nPricing for CTO (which accounted for approximately 10 percent of all of our cost of sales and 22 percent of our raw materials purchases for 2021) is subject to pricing pressures due to limited supply elasticity of the product and competing demands for its use. We may not have the ability to pass through any increases in our cost of CTO to our customers in the form of price increases or other adjustments, with a resulting negative impact on our results of operations. Additionally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to certain competitors who rely on different primary raw materials or who have more favorable terms with their suppliers.\nCTO-based biofuel has been deemed to meet the EU\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive, second phase (\u201cRED II\u201d) biofuel sustainability criteria. As a consequence of RED II, there has been a significant increase in demand for CTO and its derivatives, resulting in increasing prices for CTO and its derivatives.\nIn addition to these developments in the European Union, various pieces of legislation regarding the use of alternative fuels have been introduced in the United States at both the federal and state level. Currently, none of the legislation mandates or provides incentives for the use of CTO or its derivatives as a transportation fuel. Future legislation in the U.S. and elsewhere may promote the use of CTO or its derivatives as a feedstock for production of alternative fuels.\nBecause the supply of CTO is inherently constrained by the volume of kraft pulp processing as discussed above, any diversion of CTO for production of alternative fuels would reduce the available supply of CTO as a raw material for the pine-based chemicals industry. As described above, the Company is highly dependent on CTO as an essential raw material, and if the Company is unable to procure an adequate supply of CTO at efficient prices due to competing new uses such as for biofuel production, the Company\u2019s results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe purchase a variety of other raw materials, which are also subject to pricing pressures; inability to procure these raw materials or to pass on price increases could negatively impact our operations or financial results.\nThe Company purchases a variety of other raw materials from third parties for its manufacturing operations, including, but not limited to, hardwood sawdust, phosphoric acid, ethylene amines, black liquor, maleic/fumaric acid, hydrogen peroxide, cyclohexanone, and pentaerythritol. Each raw material is subject to its own supply and demand dynamics which may, at times, limit availability and/or cause price volatility. The Company may be unable to procure the quantities of raw materials it needs which could negatively impact our operations or we may be unable to pass through price increases to our customers which could negatively impact our financial results.\nInternational Operations Risks\nWe are exposed to the risks inherent in international sales and operations.\nIn 2021, sales to customers outside of the U.S. made up approximately 50 percent of our total sales, and we sell our products to customers in approximately 80 countries. We have exposure to risks of operating outside the U.S., including:\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi; restrictions on, or difficulties and costs associated with, the repatriation of cash from foreign countries to the U.S.; difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations, which may carry significant penalties for non-compliance; unexpected changes in political or regulatory environments; earnings and cash flows that may be subject to tax withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; political and economic instability; general country strikes or work stoppages; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic); import and export restrictions, tariffs, and other trade barriers or retaliatory actions; difficulties in maintaining overseas subsidiaries and international operations; difficulties in obtaining approval for significant transactions; government limitations on foreign ownership; government takeover or nationalization of business; and government mandated price controls.\nAny one or more of the above factors could adversely affect our international operations and could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, Chinese government agencies have in the past required companies to reduce or suspend manufacturing operations from time to time, with little or no notice, for reasons such as energy restrictions and air quality concerns. The timing and length of these suspensions, which are expected to continue occurring, are difficult to predict. These unpredictable events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, any of these factors may impact our customers\u2019 non-U.S. operations, which could reduce demand for our products. As our international operations and activities expand, we inevitably have greater exposure to the risks associated with operating in many foreign countries.\nOur engineered polymers product line may be adversely affected by the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.\nEffective January 1, 2021, the EU and the UK form two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal environments, creating new barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges.\nEven though the UK reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) and related arrangements, the regulatory frameworks of the UK and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to UK REACH and EU REACH. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our engineered polymers product line, including potential disruption to supply chains, additional compliance and operational costs, required product modifications and necessary operational changes.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFrom time to time, we may be engaged in legal actions associated with our intellectual property rights; if we are unsuccessful, these could potentially result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names and trade dress, are important to our business. See \"Intellectual Property\" included within Part I. Item 1 of this Form 10-K for more information on the 844 Patent. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used, in jurisdictions into which our products are imported, and in jurisdictions where our competitors have significant manufacturing capabilities. Our success will depend to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. However, we may be unable to obtain or maintain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions and the Company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar or duplicative products and services. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. We are currently involved in several legal actions relative to intellectual property associated with the 844 Patent. On September 15, 2021, a jury in the lawsuit filed by the Company against BASF Corporation for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Proceeding\u201d) issued a verdict in favor of BASF on certain counterclaims filed by BASF in the Delaware Proceeding. The jury awarded BASF damages of approximately $28.3 million, which will be trebled under U.S. antitrust law to approximately $85 million when the court enters judgment. In addition, BASF may seek pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in amounts that they will have to prove at a future date. Earlier in the Delaware Proceeding, the U.S. District Court dismissed the Company\u2019s patent\ninfringement claims against BASF alleging BASF infringed the 844 Patent, and invalidated some, but not all, of the claims in our 844 patent, which is set to expire in March of this year.\nThe Company disagrees with the verdict, including the court\u2019s application of the law, and it intends to seek judgment as a matter of law in the Delaware Proceeding post-trial briefing stage and on appeal, if necessary. The Company also intends to challenge the U.S. District Court\u2019s previous dismissal of the Company\u2019s patent infringement claims against BASF in the Delaware Proceedings. Final resolution of these matters could take up to eighteen months and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in its attempts to challenge the verdict. Because the outcome of the Company\u2019s post-trial motions and possible appeal is difficult to predict, as of December 31, 2021, the Company has accrued a total of $85.0 million, the full amount of the jury\u2019s verdict (including treble damages). The amount accrued for this matter is included in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, and the charge is included in Other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The amount of any liability the Company may ultimately incur related to the Delaware Proceeding could be more or less than the amount accrued. The Company has and may continue to incur additional fees, costs and expenses for as long as the post-trial motions and possible appeal are ongoing. If the Company is required to pay the entire jury verdict (together with any associated fees, costs and expenses), or the Company must make certain changes to its business when the matters associated with the Delaware Proceeding are eventually resolved, such outcomes could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Delaware Proceeding and other legal actions to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, it could be required to pay substantial damages, or it could be enjoined from offering some of its products and services.\nWe also rely heavily upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. For instance, we manufacture some of our products in China where we may be at a greater risk of a third party misappropriating our intellectual property despite the foregoing policies, procedures and agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nEnvironmental and Sustainability Risks\nCertain elements of our strategic growth are dependent on the adoption of more stringent air quality standards around the world.\nEnvironmental standards drive the implementation of gasoline vapor emission control systems by automotive manufacturers. Given increasing societal concern over global warming and health hazards associated with poor air quality, there is growing pressure on regulators across the globe to take meaningful action. For those countries that have not significantly regulated gasoline vapor emissions, enacting more stringent regulations governing gasoline vapor emissions represents a significant upside to the Company\u2019s automotive carbon business. However, regulators may react to a variety of considerations, including economic and political, that may result in any such more stringent regulations being delayed or shelved entirely, in one or more countries or regions. As the adoption of more stringent regulations governing gasoline vapor emissions is expected to drive significant growth in our automotive carbon applications, the failure to enact such regulations will have a significant impact on the growth prospects for these products.\nOur business involves hazards associated with chemical manufacturing, storage, transportation and disposal; the legal and regulatory environment related to such chemicals and other environmental impacts (such as climate change and extreme weather) could require expenditures or changes to our product formulations and operations.\nThere are hazards associated with the chemicals we manufacture and the related storage and transportation of our raw materials, including common solvents, such as toluene and methanol, and reactive chemicals, such as acrylic acid, all of which fall under the OSHA Process Safety Management Code. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations\nand have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on us as a whole. While we endeavor to provide adequate protection for the safe handling of these materials, issues could be created by various events, including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and performance by third parties, and as a result we could face potential hazards, including the following: piping and storage tank leaks and ruptures; mechanical failure; employee exposure to hazardous substances; and chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. These hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines, work stoppage injunctions, lawsuits by injured persons, damage to our public reputation and brand and diminished product acceptance. If such actions are determined adversely to us, or there is an associated economic impact to our business, we may have inadequate insurance or cash flow to offset any associated costs.\nIncreasing weather-related impacts on our operations and plant sites may impact the cost or availability of insurance. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our suppliers and customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the availability over time of our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 businesses, and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations; changes to this legal and regulatory landscape could limit our business activities and increase our operating costs.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations. Certain regulations applicable to our operations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, directive in Europe, the UK and other countries, prescribe limits restricting exposure to a number of chemicals used in our operations, including certain forms of formaldehyde, a raw material used in the manufacture of phenolic modified rosin-based ink resins and some lignin-based dispersants. Future studies on the health effects of chemicals used in our operations, including alkylphenols, such as bisphenol A, which are used in our TOR-based ink resins, may result in additional regulation or new requirements in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, which might further restrict or prohibit the use of, and exposure to, these chemicals. Additional regulation of or requirements for these or other chemicals could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality or types of products we manufacture and/or materially increase our costs.\nIncreased focus by governmental entities on environmental issues and sustainability may result in new or increased regulations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, could subject the Company to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses in future years. Additionally, changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, as well as future climate change laws and regulations, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. Our manufacturing facilities use energy, including electricity and natural gas and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may in the future be affected by legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow. Any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes.\nIndependent of any such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change or environmental harm from us or our industry could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the Company adversely, In recent years, investors have also begun to show increased interest about sustainability and climate change as it relates to their investment decisions. We have set targets for greenhouse gas reductions and related sustainability goals. If we fail to achieve our sustainability goals or reduce our impact on the environment or if we are unable to respond or are perceived to be inadequately responding to sustainability concerns, we may receive adverse publicity and certain investors may divert from, or avoid investing in, our securities, which could have a negative impact on our business and reputation.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe may be adversely affected by general global economic and financial conditions beyond our control.\nOur businesses may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general economic and business conditions, changes in tax laws or tax rates and conditions in the financial services markets including counterparty risk, insurance carrier risk, rising interest rates, inflation, deflation, fluctuations in currencies, which factors may negatively impact our ability to compete. Macro-economic challenges, including conditions in financial and capital markets and levels of unemployment, and the ability of the U.S. and other countries to deal with their rising debt levels, may continue to put pressure\non the economy or lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or tax rates will not have a material impact on our future cash taxes, effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adverse developments in global or regional economies could drive an increase or decrease in the demand for our products that could increase or decrease our revenues, increase or decrease our manufacturing costs and ultimately increase or decrease our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As a result of negative changes in the economy, customers, vendors or counterparties may experience significant cash flow problems or cause consumers of our products to postpone or refrain from spending in response to adverse economic events or conditions. If customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or cash flows or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us or we may experience lower sales volumes. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of the foregoing.\nInflation could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe attempt to reduce our inflation risk through passing on price increases where appropriate to our customers. A significant portion of our business with our customers is purchase order based, which allows us to increase prices in response to inflation and other market conditions. However, to the extent our customers are under fixed-price contracts with limited or no price adjustment mechanisms, we are unable to mitigate the impact of inflation by passing on price increases through to our customers, and we could experience an adverse impact on our results of operations as a result.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environment may materially adversely affect Ingevity\u2019s future access to capital.\nWe have, at times, relied on various forms of credit to satisfy working capital needs. Ingevity\u2019s ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be materially adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for Ingevity\u2019s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or if other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect Ingevity\u2019s ability to gain access to the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on Ingevity\u2019s competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 16044, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "NGVT"}
