RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe face risks related to health pandemics, particularly the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent variants, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, which has spread to many countries throughout the world, including the United States. The effects of this outbreak on our business have included and could continue to include temporary closures of our providers and clinics and suspensions of elective surgical procedures. This has and could continue to impact our interactions and relationships with our customers.\nIn addition to temporary closures of the providers and clinics that we serve, we could also experience temporary closures of the facilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, or other vendors in our supply chain, which could impact our business, interactions and relationships with our third-party suppliers and contractors, and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact business and the economy is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our financial condition, results of operations and value of our common stock will be affected. The uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to increase its inventory in anticipation of possible supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 virus. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions to its operations during 2020 and 2021, it is unable at this time to predict the impact that the COVID-19 virus will have on its business, financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.\nWe have encountered significant volatility in our recent operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s results from operations have improved significantly in recent years, but there have been significant volatility in our results over the past five years as reflected in the following table (in millions):\nOur financial results could continue to be volatile, and there is no assurance we will continue our current increase in revenue and profits.\nWe are dependent on reimbursement from third-party payers, most of whom are larger than we are and have substantially more employees and financial resources; changes in insurance reimbursement policies or application of them have resulted in decreased or delayed revenues.\nA large percentage of our revenues come from third-party payer reimbursement. Most of the third-party payers are large insurance companies with substantially more resources than we have. Upon delivery of our products to our patients, we directly bill the patients\u2019 private insurance companies or government payers for reimbursement. If the third-party payers do not remit payment on a timely basis or if they change their policies to exclude or reduce coverage for our products, we would experience a decline in our revenue as well as cash flow. In addition, we may deliver products to patients and invoice based on past practices and billing experiences only to have third-party payers later deny coverage for such products.\nIn some cases, our delivered product may not be covered pursuant to a policy statement of a third-party payer, despite a payment history with the third-party payer and benefits to the patients. A third-party payer may seek repayment of amounts previously paid for covered products. We maintain an allowance for provider discounts and amounts intended to cover legitimate requests for repayment. Failure to adequately identify and provide for amounts for resolution of repayment demands in our allowance for provider discounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For government health care programs, if we identify a\ndeficiency in prior claims or practices, we may be required to repay amounts previously reimbursed to us by government health care programs.\nWe frequently receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients, and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request which can accumulate to a significant amount. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. During the adjudication process we review claims where we are rebilling or pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests, we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid. Although we cannot predict whether or when a request for repayment or our subsequent request for reimbursement will be resolved, it is not unusual for such matters to be unresolved for a long period of time. No assurances can be given with respect to our estimates for our allowance for provider discounts refund claim reimbursements and offsets or the ultimate outcome of the refund requests.\nWe at times have concentrations of credit risk with third-party payers; failure to collect these and other billed receivables could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company had receivables from one third-party payer at December 31, 2021 which made up approximately 22% of the accounts receivable balance. The Company had receivables from one third-party payer at December 31, 2020, which made up approximately 26% of the accounts receivable balance.\nFuture changes in coverage and reimbursement policies for our products or reductions in reimbursement rates for our products by third party payers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, our products are prescribed by physicians for their patients. Based on the prescription, which we consider an order, we submit a claim for payment directly to third-party payers such as private commercial insurance carriers, government payers and others as appropriate and the third-party payer reimburses us directly. Federal and state statutes, rules, or other regulatory measures that restrict coverage of our products or reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell or rent our products or cause physical therapists and physicians to dispense and prescribe alternative, lower-cost products.\nThere are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable and provider discounts that we recognize, and if we are unable to accurately estimate these amounts, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition, have a significant impact on our operating results or lead to a restatement of our financial results.\nThere are significant risks associated with the estimation of the amount of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable, and provider discounts that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of coverage, differing provider discount rates, and other third-party payer issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our customers at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, require complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payers. Revenues associated with government programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payer that will ultimately be collectable from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient\u2019s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and pay or retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after our products are provided. While we typically look to our past experience in collections with a payer in estimating amounts expected to be collected on current billings, recent trends and current changes in reimbursement practice, the overall healthcare environment, and other factors nonetheless could ultimately impact the amount of revenues recorded and the receivables ultimately collected. If our estimates of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable or provider discounts are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results. It could also lead to a restatement of our financial results.\nTax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof. The most significant recent example of this is the impact of the U.S Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) which was enacted on December 22, 2017. These changes significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs, among other things. The Company has implemented the Tax Act and does not expect any significant changes related to the Tax Act at this time.\nThe Patient Protection and Accountability act of 2010 has had an impact on our business which may be in part beneficial and in part detrimental.\nIn March 2010, broad federal health care reform legislation was enacted in the United States. This legislation did not become effective immediately in total, and may be modified prior to the effective date of some provisions. This legislation has had an impact on our business in a variety of ways including increased number of Medicaid recipients, increased number of individuals with commercial insurance, additional audits conducted by public health insurance plans such as Medicaid and Medicare, changes to the rules that govern employer group health insurance and other factors that influence the acquisition and use of health insurance from private and public payers. This legislation has resulted in a change in reimbursement for certain durable medical equipment. We believe the new healthcare legislation and these changes to reimbursement have caused uncertainty with prescribers, which we believe contributed to our drop in orders and revenue during 2013 and 2014 and the lack of any significant increase in 2015. Orders and revenue increased in 2016 through 2021; however, we are currently unable to determine whether such trend will continue in future periods or whether the health care reform legislation will have other adverse consequences to our business and results of operations. To the extent prescribers write fewer prescriptions for our products or there is an adverse change to insurance reimbursement for our products, due to the new law or otherwise, our revenue and profitability will be materially adversely affected.\nThe uncertainty of continuing healthcare changes and regulations may place our business model in doubt.\nThere is some doubt on the continuation of the Affordable Care Act and the legislation that the current Congress will enact to replace it, if any. Because we cannot be certain about the continuation of the Affordable Care Act or any changes or replacements thereto, even if the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, there is also some doubt whether the President will support it or take regulatory action to negatively impact its benefits. The amount of uncertainty creates concern on our customer\u2019s willingness to buy products which may, or may not, be covered by future health care benefits even if they are covered currently.\nHospitals and clinicians may not buy, prescribe or use our products in sufficient numbers, which could result in decreased revenues and profits.\nHospitals and clinicians may not accept any of our products as effective, reliable, or cost-effective. Factors that could prevent such institutional patient acceptance include:\n\u25cf If patients conclude that the costs of these products exceed the cost savings associated with the use of these products;\n\u25cf If patients are financially unable to purchase these products;\n\u25cf If adverse patient events occur with the use of these products, generating adverse publicity;\n\u25cf If we lack adequate resources to provide sufficient education and training to our patients;\n\u25cf If frequent product malfunctions occur, leading clinicians to believe that the products are unreliable;\n\u25cf Uncertainty regarding or change in government or third-party payer reimbursement policies for our products; and\n\u25cf If physicians or other health care providers believe that our products will not be reimbursed by insurers or decide to prescribe competing products.\nBecause our sales are dependent on prescriptions from physicians, if any of these or other factors result in fewer prescriptions for our products being written, we will have reduced revenues and may not be able to fully fund our operations. Although we experienced an increase in orders for our ZMI products during 2020 and 2021 compared to prior years, we can make no assurances that demand for our products will not decline in future periods.\nAny new competitor could be larger than us and have greater financial and other resources than we do, and those advantages could make it difficult for us to compete with them.\nMany competitors to our products may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. Competition could result in fewer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our products are regulated by the FDA in the United States. Competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our FDA-cleared products, thereby using our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain FDA approval for their own products. If overall demand for our products should decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Substantial competition is expected in the future in the area of stroke rehabilitation that may directly compete with our NeuroMove product. These competitors may use standard or novel signal processing techniques to detect muscular movement and generate stimulation to such muscles. Other companies may develop rehabilitation products that perform better and/or are less expensive than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nFailure to keep pace with the latest technological changes could result in decreased revenues.\nThe market for some of our products is characterized by rapid change and technological improvements. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments could result in serious harm to our business and operating results. We have derived, and we expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from the development and sale of products in the medical device industry. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market product offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our competitors, evolving industry standards and changing patient preferences. There is no assurance that we will keep up with technological improvements.\nOur business could be adversely affected by reliance on sole suppliers.\nNotwithstanding our current multiple supplier approach, certain essential product components may be supplied in the future by sole, or a limited group of, suppliers. Most of our products and components are purchased through purchase orders rather than through long term supply agreements and large volumes of inventory may not be maintained. There may be shortages and delays in obtaining certain product components. Disruption of the supply or inventory of components could result in a significant increase in the costs of these components or could result in an inability to meet the demand for our products. In addition, if a change in the manufacturer of a key component is required, qualification of a new supplier may result in delays and additional expenses in meeting customer demand for products. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and ability to retain our experienced sales force.\nA third-party manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications could result in lost revenue.\nThird-party manufacturers assemble and manufacture components of the NexWave and NeuroMove and some of our other products to our specifications. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our patients for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Because of the timing and seriousness of our business, and the medical device industry in particular, the dates on which patients need and require shipments of products from us are critical. Further, because quality is a leading factor when patients, doctors, health insurance providers and distributors accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular patient.\nWe could experience cost increases or disruptions in supply of raw materials or other components used in our products.\nOur third-party manufacturers that assemble and manufacture components for our products expect to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our product. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control including market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, any delays or disruptions in our supply chain could harm our business. For example, COVID-19, including associated variants, could cause disruptions to and delays in our operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain parts, including semiconductors, materials and equipment necessary for the production of our products, and the internal designs and processes we or third-parties may adopt in an effort to remedy or mitigate impacts of such disruptions and delays could result in higher costs. In addition, our business also depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our products. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality battery cells. These risks include:\n\u25cf the inability or unwillingness of battery cell manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of battery cells (including the applicable chemistries) required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of battery cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and\n\u25cf an increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply of raw materials used in battery cells, such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt.\nFurthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials or components would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins.\nWe depend upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for our products. We do not have long-term agreements with our semiconductor chip manufacturers and suppliers, and if these manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply of semiconductor chips, with respect to which there is a global shortage, we would not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and our business would be adversely impacted.\nSemiconductor chips are a vital input component to the electrical architecture of our products, controlling wide aspects of the products\u2019 operations. Many of the key semiconductor chips we use in our products come from limited or single sources of supply, and therefore a disruption with any one manufacturer or supplier in our supply chain would have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively manufacture and timely deliver our products. We do not have any long- term supply contracts with any suppliers and purchase chips on a purchase order basis. Due to our reliance on these semiconductor chips, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in their supply. We are in the process of identifying alternative manufacturers for semiconductor chips. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, semiconductor chip shortages, and the availability and cost of these components would be difficult to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems.\nIn particular, increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for consumer electronics that use these chips, has resulted in a severe global shortage of chips in 2021. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips to be used in our products has been adversely affected. This shortage may result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of our products, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, and we are unable to mitigate the effects of this shortage, our ability to deliver sufficient quantities of our products to fulfill our preorders and to support our growth through sales to new customers would be adversely affected. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in managing ongoing chip shortages, including additional research and development expenses, engineering design and development costs in the event that new suppliers must be onboarded on an expedited basis. Further, ongoing delays in production and shipment of products due to a continuing shortage of semiconductor chips may harm our reputation and discourage additional preorders and sales, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf we need to replace manufacturers, our expenses could increase resulting in smaller profit margins.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot assure that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to existing terms, which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively. Should we be forced to replace one or more of our manufacturers, we may experience increased costs or an adverse operational impact due to delays in distribution and delivery of our products to our patients, which could cause us to lose patients or lose revenue because of late shipments.\nWe are a relatively small company with a limited number of products and staff. Sales fluctuations and employee turnover may adversely affect our business.\nWe are a relatively small company. Consequently, compared to larger companies, sales fluctuations could have a greater impact on our revenue and profitability on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis and delays in patient orders could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year-to-year. In addition, as a small company we have limited staff and are heavily reliant on certain key personnel to operate our business. If a key employee were to leave the company it could have a material impact on our business and results of operations as we might not have sufficient depth in our staffing to fill the role that was previously being performed. A delay in filling the vacated position could put a strain on existing personnel or result in a failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or to effectively implement our internal controls, and materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to retain the services of Mr. Sandgaard or if we are unable to successfully recruit qualified managerial and sales personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Mr. Thomas Sandgaard, our Chief Executive Officer, Founder, and beneficial owner of approximately 38% of our outstanding stock. Loss of the services of Mr. Sandgaard could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. There is currently no employment agreement with Mr. Sandgaard. We do not maintain key-man insurance on the life of Mr. Sandgaard. In addition, in order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully retaining and recruiting qualified managerial and sales personnel. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. Various factors, such as marketability of our products, our reputation, our liquidity, and sales commission structure can affect our ability to find, attract or retain sales personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract qualified new employees and sales representatives and retain existing employees and sales representatives.\nWe need to maintain insurance coverage, which could become very expensive or have limited availability.\nOur marketing and sales of medical device products creates an inherent risk of claims for product liability. As a result, we carry product liability insurance and will continue to maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate to protect us from claims. We cannot, however, be assured that we have resources sufficient to satisfy liability claims in excess of policy limits if required to do so. Also, if we are subject to such liability claims, there is no assurance that our insurance provider will continue to insure us at current levels or that our insurance rates will not substantially rise in the future, resulting in increased costs to us or forcing us to either pay higher premiums or reduce our coverage amounts, which would result in increased liability to claims.\nWe depend upon obtaining regulatory approval of any new products and/or manufacturing operations we develop and maintain approvals of current products; failure to obtain or maintain such regulatory approvals could result in increased costs, lost revenue, penalties and fines.\nBefore marketing any new products, we will need to complete one or more clinical investigations of each product. There can be no assurance that the results of such clinical investigations will be favorable to us. We may not know the results of any study, favorable or unfavorable to us, until after the study has been completed. Such data must be submitted to the FDA as part of any regulatory filing seeking approval to market the product. Even if the results are favorable, the FDA may dispute the claims of safety, efficacy, or clinical utility and not allow the product to be marketed. The sales price of the product may not be enough to recoup the amount of our investment in conducting the investigative studies and we may expend significant funds on research and development on products that are rejected by the FDA. Some of our products are marketed based upon our interpretation of FDA regulation allowing for changes to an existing device. If our interpretations are incorrect, we could suffer consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and could result in fines and penalties. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources to complete development of any new products or to complete the regulatory approval process or to maintain regulatory compliance of existing products.\nWe may not be able to obtain clearance of a 510(k) notification or approval of a de novo or pre-market approval application with respect to any products on a timely basis, if at all.\nIf timely FDA clearance or approval of new products is not obtained, our business could be materially adversely affected. Clearance of a 510(k) notification or de novo application may also be required before marketing certain previously marketed products, which have been modified after they have been cleared. Should the FDA so require, the filing of a new 510(k) notification for the modification of the product may be required prior to marketing any modified device. To determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved, the FDA may inspect our facilities at any time. Such compliance can be difficult and costly to achieve and maintain. Our compliance status may change due to future changes in, or interpretations of, FDA regulations or other regulatory agencies. Such changes may result in the FDA withdrawing marketing clearance or requiring product recall. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device or its intended use may require us to reassess compliance with good manufacturing practices guidelines, potentially interrupting the marketing and sale of products. We may also fail to comply with complex FDA regulations due to their complexity or otherwise. Failure to comply with regulations could result in enforceable actions, including product seizures, product recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals, and civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation.\nOur products are subject to recall even after receiving FDA or foreign clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or respective governmental authorities in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling.\nAny recall would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure you that we will not have product recalls in the future or that such recalls would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We have not undertaken any voluntary or involuntary recalls to date.\nWe continue to incur expenses.\nThis area of medical device research is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. Developments and advances in the medical industry by either competitors or other parties can affect our business in either a positive or negative manner. Developments and changes in technology that are favorable to us may significantly advance the potential of our research while developments and advances in research methods outside of the methods we are using may severely hinder, or halt completely our development.\nWe are a small company in terms of employees, technical and research resources. We expect to incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These amounts may increase, and recently have in connection with our efforts to expand our sales force, before any commensurate incremental revenue from these efforts may be obtained and may adversely affect our potential profits and we may lack the liquidity to pay for such expenditures. These factors may also hinder our ability to meet changes in the medical industry as rapidly or effectively as competitors with more resources.\nSubstantial costs could be incurred defending against claims of infringement.\nOther companies, including competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would limit, interfere with, or otherwise circumscribe our ability to make, use, or sell products. Should there be a successful claim of infringement against us and if we could not license the alleged infringed technology at a reasonable cost, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. The validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Any litigation claims against us, independent of their validity, may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources with no assurance of success. Intellectual property claims could cause us to:\n\u25cf Cease selling, incorporating, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf Obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u25cf Re-design our products excluding the infringed intellectual property, which may not be possible.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe consider our trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property an integral component of our success. We rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property. Effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available. We obtained utility patents on the fluid monitoring system in 2021 and 2018 in the U.S. and in 2020 in Europe. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property, especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, if our third-party confidentiality agreements are breached, there may not be an adequate remedy available to us. If our trade secrets become publicly known, we may lose competitive advantages.\nWe may fail to protect the privacy, integrity and security of customer information.\nWe possess and process sensitive customer information and Protected Health Information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). While we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, it could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with health care privacy and consumer protection laws. A compromise of our privacy or security procedures could also subject us to liability under certain health care privacy laws applicable to us.\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.\nIncreased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks have resulted in an increase in information security risks in recent years. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack products and services and gain access to networks and data centers. If we experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary and confidential information and may contain personal data of our customers. A security breach could result in disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nExpansion of our operations and sales internationally may subject us to additional risks, including risks associated with unexpected events.\nA component of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and sales internationally. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market, sell, and deliver our products in foreign markets, or that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations. Global operations could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing risks, events, and circumstances.\nThe following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf difficulties in managing foreign operations and attracting and retaining appropriate levels of senior management and staffing;\n\u25cf longer cash collection cycles;\n\u25cf proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf failure to properly comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, product approval, healthcare and employment law requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of the products we provide in foreign markets;\n\u25cf the ability to efficiently repatriate cash to the United States and transfer cash between foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u25cf changes in general economic conditions or political circumstances in countries where we operate.\nOur acquisition of other companies could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we recently made and may in the future acquire or make investments in other companies, solutions or technologies to, among other reasons, expand or enhance our product offerings. In the future, any significant acquisition would require the consent of our lenders. Any failure to receive such consent could delay or prohibit us from acquiring companies that we believe could enhance our business.\nWe may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals from our recent or any future acquisition, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, customers, partners or investors. In addition, if we fail to integrate successfully such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenues and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. For example, we recently acquired Kestrel Labs, Inc. and we must effectively integrate the personnel, products, technologies and customers and develop and motivate new employees. In addition, we may not be able to successfully retain the customers and key personnel of such acquisitions over the longer term, which could also adversely affect our business. The integration of our recently-acquired business or future-acquired business will require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired business and accurately forecast the financial impact of the acquisition, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc., we paid an approximate value of $30.5 million, consisting of $16.1 million in cash which was financed through Bank of America N.A. and approximately $14.4 million in Zynex common stock, a portion of which is held in escrow until certain milestones are achieved. To fund any future acquisition, we may issue equity, which would result in dilution to our stockholders, or incur more debt, which would result in increased fixed obligations and could subject us to additional covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.\nIf we are not able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business could be harmed.\nOur inability to successfully integrate our recent and future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u25cf unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;\n\u25cf unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u25cf maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u25cf integrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf preserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u25cf consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and\n\u25cf coordinating geographically separate organizations.\nIn addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. For example, the failure to get regulatory approval to sell certain products of an acquired business may significantly reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could harm our results of operations, even if we have put in place contingencies for the delivery of closing consideration, such as the escrowed shares held back in our acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc. Further, acquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u25cf issue securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage;\n\u25cf use a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u25cf increase our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;\n\u25cf assume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners or have indemnification that may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners;\n\u25cf record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges;\n\u25cf experience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition liability estimates;\n\u25cf incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u25cf lose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;\n\u25cf incur large and immediate write-offs; or\n\u25cf become subject to litigation.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our loan agreement could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business as planned.\nWe currently have an outstanding term loan and line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. under which we are obligated to pay monthly amortization payments. Our loan agreement contains, and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the bank preventing us from accessing availability under our line of credit and requiring us to repay any outstanding borrowings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers in the event of covenant violations or that such waivers will be available on commercially acceptable terms.\nIn addition, the indebtedness under our loan agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, and therefore, if we are unable to repay such indebtedness the bank could foreclose on these assets and sell the pledged equity interests, which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business. If any of these were to occur, we may not be able to continue operations as planned, implement our planned growth strategy or react to opportunities for or downturns in our business.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nWe are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems. Such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nSales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Sandgaard, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock\nSales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Sandgaard, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Mr. Sandgaard\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nOur existing shareholders may experience dilution if we elect to raise equity capital\nDue to our past liquidity issues, we have had to raise capital in the form of debt and/or equity to meet our working capital needs. As recent as July 2020, we did raise capital through the issuance of equity to meet our working capital needs and to execute on our business strategy. We may also choose to issue equity or debt securities in the future to meet our liquidity or other needs which would result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we will attempt to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to do so. We may have to issue additional shares of our common stock at prices at a discount from the then-current market price of our common stock. If we raise additional working capital, existing shareholders may experience dilution.\nWe paid a dividend on our common stock, and cash used to pay dividends will not be available for other corporate purposes\nIn 2018, our Board of Directors declared a special one-time dividend of $0.07 per share, which was paid in January 2019. In 2021, our Board of Directors declared a special one-time dividend of $0.10 per share, which was paid in January 2022. The decision to pay dividends in the future will depend on general business conditions, the impact of such payment on our financial condition, and other factors our Board of Directors may consider. If we elect to pay future dividends, this could reduce our cash reserves to levels that may be inadequate to fund expansions to our business plan or unanticipated contingent liabilities.\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business", "PERMNO": 18418, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ZYXI"}
