RISK FACTORS\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Stockholders should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing the Company\u2019s common shares. The occurrence of any of the following events could harm the Company. If these events occur, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares could decline, and shareholders may lose part or even all of their investment. This report, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, contains forward looking statements that may be materially affected by numerous risk factors, including those summarized below:\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe are dependent upon production of precious metals and industrial minerals from to being acquired properties and have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1991 and may never be profitable.\nSince our inception in 1991, we have not been profitable. As of June 30, 2017, our total accumulated deficit was approximately $98.0 million. In November 2013, we suspended mine and mill operations at our Summit mine and Banner mill due to operating losses, and a lack of operating capital. On August 26, 2015 Santa Fe Gold filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection, Case # 15-11761 (MFW) and that case was dismissed on June 15, 2016. The Summit Silver-Gold Project, the Lordsburg Copper Project, Black Canyon Mica Project, Planet MIO Project, all claims and other assets were lost in the process of the 363 Asset Sale.\nOur current management team is acquiring new claims funded by equity sales and is evaluating a number of favorable options to facilitate the processing of current and future mineralized ore production.\nTo become profitable, we must identify acceptable mineralization at potential sites and either develops properties ourselves or locates and enters into agreements with third party operators. We may suffer significant additional losses in the future and may never be profitable. There can be no assurance we will receive significant revenue from operations in the foreseeable future, if at all. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIf the Company is unsuccessful raising additional funding, its business may not continue as a going concern. Even if the Company does find additional funding sources, it may be required to issue securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of its common shares or on terms less favorable than the Convertible Gold Note financing. The Company may also be required to take other actions that may lessen the value of its common shares or dilute its common shareholders, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to the Company or issuing additional equity securities. If the Company experiences difficulties raising money in the future, its business and liquidity will be materially adversely affected.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAs a result of these factors, as well as adverse industry conditions, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2017. The presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our customers, vendors and employees and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nA substantial or extended decline in gold and silver prices would have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets, on our ability to raise capital and could result in lower than estimated economic returns.\nThe value of our assets, our ability to raise capital and our future economic returns are substantially dependent on the prices of gold and silver. The gold and silver price fluctuates on a daily basis and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence gold prices include:\n\u00b7gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves;\n\u00b7speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold;\n\u00b7the relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7expectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u00b7interest rates;\n\u00b7changes to economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u00b7geopolitical conflicts;\n\u00b7changes in industrial, jewelry or investment demand;\n\u00b7changes in supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; and\n\u00b7Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions.\nA substantial or extended decline in the gold or silver price could:\n\u00b7negatively impact our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7jeopardize the restart and development of our Summit silver-gold project;\n\u00b7reduce the potential for future revenues from gold projects in which we have an interest;\n\u00b7reduce funds available to us for exploration with the result that we may not be able to further advance any of our projects; and\n\u00b7reduce the market value of our assets.\nIn addition to environmental regulations, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations directly and indirectly relating to mining that often change and could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive United States federal, state and local laws and regulations related to mine prospecting, development, transportation, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, mine safety, hazardous materials, toxic substances and other matters. These laws and regulation frequently change. New laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing ones could have a material adverse impact on us, causing a delay or reduction in production, increasing costs and preventing an expansion of mining activities.\nDelaware law and our Articles of Incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits. Delaware law provides that our directors will not be liable to our stockholders or to us for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and there is no guarantee of the prices at which the shares will trade.\nTrading of our common stock is conducted on the OTC Marketplace operated by the OTC Markets Group, Inc., or \u201cOTC Pink Sheets,\u201d under the ticker symbol \u201cSFEG.\u201d Not being listed for trading on an established securities exchange has an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of the Company. This may result in lower prices for your common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. Historically, our common stock has been thinly traded, and there is no guarantee of the prices at which the shares will trade, or of the ability of stockholders to sell their shares without having an adverse effect on market prices.\nBecause our common stock is currently a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock at times and prices that are acceptable.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the purchase. The penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock. Because of these rules, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions and there is less trading in penny stocks. Accordingly, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices that you feel are appropriate.\nThe sale of our common stock by selling stockholders may depress the price of our common stock due to the limited trading market that exists.\nDue to a number of factors, including the lack of listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, the trading volume in our common stock has historically been limited. Trading volume over the last 3 months, ending June 30, 2017, has averaged approximately 174,500 shares per day. As a result, the sale of a significant amount of common stock by selling shareholders may depress the price of our common stock and the price of our common stock may decline.\nCompletion of one or more new acquisitions could result in the issuance of a significant amount of additional common stock, which may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAcquisition of one or more additional mineral properties, conceptually, could result in the issuance of a significant amount of common stock. Such issuance could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition to volatility associated with OTC securities in general, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7changes in the worldwide prices for gold or silver;\n\u00b7disappointing results from our exploration or development efforts;\n\u00b7failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u00b7decline in demand for our common stock;\n\u00b7downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u00b7technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and\n\u00b7general economic trends.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of securities generally have been highly volatile. These fluctuations commonly are unrelated to operating performance of a company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may be unable to resell their shares at a fair price.\nA small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of our common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with our four largest shareholders, beneficially own approximately 32.0% of our common stock as of the date of this report. Under our Articles of Incorporation and Delaware law, the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, these individuals and entities will be able to influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock to date, and we may not be in a position to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Further, our initial earnings, if any, will likely be retained to finance our growth. Any future dividends will depend upon our earnings, our then-existing financial requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 80413, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "SFEG"}
