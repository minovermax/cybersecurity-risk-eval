{"cik": "1418100", "company": "Avaya Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe risk factors summarized and detailed below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to:\nRisks Related to our Business\n\u2022executing our strategic operating plan, including our strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022shifting more of our business to a subscription-based operating expense model which may harm our cash flows;\n\u2022completing acquisitions and/or strategic alliances, including those needed to increase our share of the cloud communications industry and integrating such acquired businesses and alliances\u037e\n\u2022market opportunities may not develop for our solutions and services in ways that we anticipate and we may not succeed in developing new innovative solutions and services to keep pace with rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and customer preferences;\n\u2022industry consolidation and competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions;\n\u2022increasing use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may expose us to social and ethical issues which may result in reputational harm and liability;\n\u2022our ability to continue to expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings;\n\u2022our reliance on our indirect sales channel;\n\u2022disruptions to our third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with government entities;\n\u2022our ability to detect and correct design defects, errors, failures or \u201cbugs\u201d in our products and services;\n\u2022litigation, intellectual property, infringement claims and the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022some of our products contain software from open source code sources;\n\u2022failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection;\n\u2022security breaches of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers;\n\u2022operational, logistical, economic and/or political challenges in a specific country or region, including compliance with United States (\"U.S.\") and foreign government laws and regulations, which could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors;\n\u2022compliance with certain telecommunications or other rules and regulations, which could subject us to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with government entities and changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions and retaliatory measures by other countries;\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\n\u2022our revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance;\n\u2022shifts in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or the mix of products, solutions and services purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results;\n\u2022we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired;\n\u2022our degree of leverage and related interest expense;\n\u2022restrictions included in our financing agreements and indentures;\n\u2022our ability to service all of our indebtedness and other ongoing liquidity needs and to raise additional capital to fund our operations;\n\u2022the price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially;\n\u2022our intention not to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022potential for significantly dilutive issuance of common stock and/or preferred stock, including upon the conversion of our convertible notes and preferred stock; and\n\u2022the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain consent rights over charter amendments and issuances of senior equity and they may exercise their redemption or put rights.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur Operations, Markets and Competition\nIf we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan, which depends in part on our ability to increase our share of the market for cloud-based solutions, software and services offerings, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nEach year, we develop our strategic operating plan that serves as a roadmap for implementing our business strategy and the basis for the allocation of resources, capital, investment decisions, product life cycles, process improvements and strategic alliances and acquisitions. In developing our strategic operating plan, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to the market environment, customer demand, evolving technologies, competition, market consolidation, the global economy and our overall strategic priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. Actual economic, market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions and we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic operating plan.\nWe sell business communications solutions and services in markets where the technology available and the utilized go-to-market models change rapidly. We are in the midst of a multi-year transformation, evolving from a traditional telecommunications hardware company into a software and services company, focused on expanding our cloud- and mobile-enabled contact center, unified communications and innovative next-generation workflow automation solutions. To increase our revenue, we must continue to expand and develop new cloud-based solutions and services offerings as the market rapidly develops and changes. Our cloud enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services must offer relevant features and provide consistent high-quality services at competitive prices to attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such solutions and services. The functionality, relevance and customer acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and services will depend, in part, on our ability and our partners' ability to integrate our offerings with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise collaboration, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, human capital management and other proprietary application suites. Moreover, our business will remain dependent on customer decisions to migrate their legacy communications infrastructures to cloud solutions based on newer technology.\nIf the market for cloud-based communications fails to develop, develops more slowly than we anticipate, or develops in a manner different than we expect, or if we are not able to successfully develop and expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings, our cloud-based solutions and services could fail to achieve market acceptance. This in turn could impact our growth strategy and our ability to execute our strategic operating plan, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe timing of our cash flows may be negatively impacted as we shift more of our business to a subscription-based model.\nWe intend to increase our recurring revenue by shifting more of our business to a subscription-based model instead of a perpetual license model. To do this, we need to offer relevant cloud-enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services at competitive prices, which will both attract new customers and which we can bundle and upsell to existing customers. If we successfully increase our subscription revenues, we expect that it will result in more of our cash receipts being deferred relative to our historical perpetual license model as payments are spread over a pre-determined time period (e.g. monthly or annually) rather than being received upfront.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions and/or strategic alliances and effectively integrate acquired businesses, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic operating plan requires continued investments in acquisitions and strategic alliances with other companies in various areas, specifically, with respect to, accelerating the development, sales and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and services, such as our acquisition of CTIntegrations, LLC, a digital channel platform, in August 2021. Identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives and/or partners may be time consuming and divert the attention and focus of management and other key personnel. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other things, economic conditions, market consolidation, industry trends and competing bidders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any acquisition or strategic alliance even if we expend significant sums and efforts in connection with a potential transaction. Without such transactions it may be challenging for us to execute on our strategic operating plan in our desired time frame and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOnce we complete an acquisition or other material investment, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, resulting in the failure to realize the intended benefits. Acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations and, where deemed desirable, transitioning overlapping products into a single product line, thereby resulting in the diversion of capital and the attention of management and other key personnel away from other business issues and opportunities. We may also fail to retain employees acquired through acquisitions, which may negatively impact our integration efforts or our due diligence efforts may not reveal all potential liabilities associated with the acquired entity. We may incur substantial expenses as part of these corporate development and integration processes and if we fail to successfully identify, execute and integrate acquisitions or product portfolios, or if they fail to perform as we anticipate, our existing businesses and\nour revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur strategic operating plan relies in part upon the successful execution of our strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc. (\"RingCentral\"), which may not be successful.\nOur strategic operating plan relies on market acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and investing in being at the forefront of offering these solutions. Our ability to implement this strategy relies, at least in part, on our strategic partnership with RingCentral. A strategic partnership between two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process that will require significant management attention and resources. Realizing the benefits of our strategic partnership with RingCentral will depend in part on our ability to work with RingCentral to develop, market and sell Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral (\"Avaya Cloud Office\" or \"ACO\"). As with any strategic partnership, unforeseen challenges may arise, which could impact the ultimate benefits achieved from the alliance. In addition, the process of bringing ACO to market in additional countries may take longer than anticipated, which could negate some of our anticipated benefits and revenue opportunities.\nThe failure to meet the challenges involved in having two businesses work together could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of this partnership, including realization of amounts previously paid, and cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities. We may also incur significant costs associated with this partnership and our revenues may not increase as anticipated, which may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business communications solutions and services may not match market opportunities and the new solutions and services we develop may not keep pace with rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and customer preferences.\nThe demand for our solutions and services can change quickly and in ways that we may not anticipate because the market in which we operate is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and a limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders. Our solutions and services may not satisfy customer needs and we may not be able to successfully identify new market opportunities for our solutions and services. Also, our partners may stop providing Avaya services or products or reduce the amount of Avaya services or products they offer.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully develop and bring new solutions to market in a timely manner. Our solutions need to keep pace with changes in technology, industry standards and customer needs. Our operating results may be adversely affected if the market opportunity for our solutions and services does not develop in the ways that we anticipate and/or if we are not able to successfully identify new market opportunities for our solutions and services, develop and bring new solutions to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our solutions and services.\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence (\"AI\") in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development (\"R&D\") costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings and we anticipate it will be a growing aspect of our solutions as our offerings evolve. AI presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Potential government regulation in the space of AI ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, subjecting us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Failure to address AI ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services.\nWe face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth.\nThe markets for our solutions and services are characterized by rapid changes in customer demands, ongoing technological changes, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in this market and competing for customers. As these markets evolve, we expect competition to intensify and to expand to include companies that do not currently compete against us.\nBecause we offer solutions for contact centers and unified communications which are cloud-based, on-premise or hybrid, we face a wide range of competitors. Some of our competitors include:\n\u2022Enterprise UCC: Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Atos Unify, Cisco, Huawei, Microsoft and NEC.\n\u2022Midmarket UCC: Cisco, Microsoft, Mitel and NEC.\n\u2022Cloud Products and Services: 8x8, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (with RingCentral), Atos Unify (with RingCentral), Cisco, Fuze, Google, LogMeIn, Microsoft, Mitel, RingCentral, Twilio, Vonage and Zoom.\n\u2022Video Products and Solutions: BlueJeans, Cisco, Google, Huawei, LifeSize, LogMeIn, Microsoft, Poly, RingCentral, Yealink, Zoom and ZTE.\n\u2022Enterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Aspect Software, Cisco, Enghouse Interactive, Genesys, Huawei, Mitel and NEC.\n\u2022Midmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Amazon, Cisco, Five9, Genesys, NICE InContact, Serenova, Talkdesk, Twilio and Vonage.\nWe also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, such as Huawei in China and Intelbras in Latin America.\nSeveral of our existing competitors have, and many of our future competitors may have, greater financial, personnel, technical, R&D and other resources, more well-established brands or reputations and broader customer bases than we do and, as a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. On the other hand, smaller competitors may be able to respond to technological evolution and changes in customer demand with more speed and agility than we can. In addition, some competitors may have customer bases that are more geographically balanced than ours and, therefore, may be less affected by an economic downturn in a particular region. Other companies may have relationships with channel partners, distributors, resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and/or network service providers which pose a competitive threat to us. Moreover, other competitors may have deeper expertise in a particular stand-alone technology that develops more quickly than we anticipate. Competitors with greater resources may also be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or other incentives that we cannot match or do not offer.\nWe may face increased competition from current leaders in IT infrastructure, consumer products, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications. In addition, because the business communications market continues to evolve and technology continues to develop rapidly, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete against us, but whose current business activities may bring them into competition with us in the future. In particular, this may be the case as business, information technology and communications applications deployed on converged networks become more integrated to support business communications. With respect to services, we may also face competition from companies that seek to sell remotely hosted services or software as a service directly to end customers. Competition from potential market entrants may take many forms, including offering products and solutions similar to those that we offer. In addition, certain of these technologies continue to move from a proprietary environment to an open standards-based environment.\nWe cannot predict which competitors may enter our markets, what forms such competition may take or whether we will be able to respond effectively to new competitors or to the rapid evolution in technology and product development that has characterized our businesses. In addition, in order to effectively compete with any new technology or a new market entrant, we may need to make additional investments in our business, use more capital resources than our business currently requires or reduce prices, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the markets in which we compete as companies that provide unified communications are purchasing contact center providers. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in an evolving market and as companies are acquired or sell businesses because they are unable to continue all or a portion of their operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, and reduce their business with us. Furthermore, rapid consolidation, particularly in the value-added reseller (\u201cVAR\u201d) and service provider markets, will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our business.\nIndustry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers and our partners may turn toward other solutions. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings and grow our share of the cloud communications market for such offerings through customer acceptance.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is our ability to significantly increase revenues generated from sales of our cloud-based communications solutions and related services. To increase our revenue, we must continue to expand and develop new cloud-based solutions and services offerings as the market rapidly develops and changes. Our cloud enabled unified communications and contact center solutions and services must offer relevant features and provide consistent high-quality services at competitive prices to attract new customers and to migrate existing customers to such solutions and services. While\nwe have entered into a strategic partnership with RingCentral that enhances our cloud-based offerings, there is no assurance that this partnership will provide us with the desired long-term growth opportunities and results as there are a number of dependencies, including customer acceptance of ACO.\nThe cloud communications industry is competitive and rapidly evolving, and we expect competition to increase. The functionality, relevance and customer acceptance of our cloud-based solutions and services will depend, in part, on our ability and our partners' ability to integrate these with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise collaboration, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, human capital management and other proprietary application suites. If we fail to integrate our software with new third-party back-end enterprise applications and platforms used by our customers, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nAs is typical of any new solution introduced in a rapidly evolving market, the level of demand for, and market acceptance of these new solutions is uncertain. If we successfully expand and develop our cloud-based solutions and services, including, without limitation, Avaya OneCloud Private and Avaya Cloud Office, our business will remain dependent on customer decisions to migrate their legacy communications infrastructures to cloud solutions based on newer technology. While these investment decisions are often driven by macroeconomic factors, customers may also delay the purchase of newer technology due to a range of other factors, including prioritization of other IT projects, delays or failures to meet customers' certification requirements, the weighing of the costs and benefits of deploying new infrastructures and devices and the need to deploy capital to respond to unforeseen circumstances. In addition, customers' focus on the architecture, management and integration of such new technologies, possible cyber breaches and other security considerations could also affect market acceptance of new solutions. If the market for cloud-based communications fails to develop, develops more slowly than we anticipate, or develops in a manner different than we expect, or if we are not able to successfully develop and expand our cloud-based solutions and services offerings, our cloud-based solutions and services could fail to achieve market acceptance, which in turn could impact our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel.\nAn important element of our go-to-market strategy to expand sales coverage, penetrate new markets and increase market absorption of new solutions is the use of our global network of alliance partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators, who are collectively referred to as our \"channel partners\". Our financial results could be adversely affected if our relationships with these channel partners were to deteriorate, if our support pricing or other services strategies conflict with those of our channel partners, if any of our competitors were to enter into strategic relationships with or acquire any of our channel partners, if some or all of our channel partners do not become enabled to sell new solutions and services or if the financial condition of some or all of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, we may expend time, money and other resources on developing and maintaining channel relationships that are ultimately unsuccessful. Furthermore, despite the benefits of a robust indirect channel, our channel partners have direct contact with our customers, which may foster independent relationships between them and may lead them to sell non-Avaya solutions to certain customers which may result in a loss of business and revenue for us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing relationships with channel partners. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers or market share. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year with automatic renewals for successive one-year terms and generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30 days' notice. Our standard program agreements for distributors generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days' prior written notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. In addition, our alliance partners (including RingCentral), distributors and resellers are permitted to work with other vendors, including our competitors, and most of them do so. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Alliances and Partnerships\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our global channel partner program and the standard terms of our program agreements.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of our products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Mexico, Taiwan, Germany, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs furnished or approved by us and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may\nbe necessary or appropriate. Although we closely manage the transition process when manufacturing changes are required, we could experience disruption to our operations during any such transition. Any such disruption could negatively affect our reputation and our operating results. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components and resell them separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand. In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited source of suppliers. These sole source and limited source suppliers may stop selling their components at commercially reasonable prices or at all. Interruptions, delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations. We may not be able to make scheduled product deliveries to our customers in a timely fashion. We could incur significant costs to redesign our products or to qualify alternative suppliers, which would reduce our realized margins. We have also outsourced substantially all of our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations. If any of our providers of outsourced services were to experience financial difficulty or seek protection under bankruptcy laws it could also affect their ability to perform services for us.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting partners and providers of other cloud-based services. If these third-party providers do not perform as expected, our customers may be adversely affected, resulting in potential liability and negative exposure for us. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers due to poor performance, cyber breaches or other security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time and expense to us, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nContracting with government entities can be complex, expensive and time-consuming.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company\u2019s revenue from contracts with U.S. federal government entities was approximately $231 million. The procurement process for government entities is in many ways more challenging than contracting in the private sector. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance and pricing of contracts with government entities, including U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies. These laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business or prolong or complicate our sales efforts, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations or other applicable requirements could lead to claims for damages from our customers, penalties, termination of contracts and other adverse consequences. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with government entities could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment entities often require highly specialized contract terms that may differ from our standard arrangements. Government entities often impose compliance requirements that are complicated, require preferential pricing or \u201cmost favored nation\u201d terms and conditions, or are otherwise time-consuming and expensive to satisfy. Compliance with these special standards or satisfaction of such requirements could complicate our efforts to obtain business or increase the cost of doing so. Even if we do meet these special standards or requirements, the increased costs associated with providing our solutions to government customers could harm our margins.\nBusiness communications solutions are complex, and design defects, errors, failures or \"bugs\" may be difficult to detect and correct and could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and cause us to lose customers.\nBusiness communications products are complex, integrating hardware, software and many elements of a customer\u2019s existing network and communications infrastructure. Despite testing conducted prior to the release of solutions to the market and quality assurance programs, hardware may malfunction and software may contain \"bugs\" that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins.\nDepending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a material impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, the temporary or permanent withdrawal from an application, product or market, damage to our reputation, an increase in inventory costs, an increase in warranty claims, lawsuits by customers or customers\u2019 or channel partners\u2019 end users, or application or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover claims that are successfully asserted against us.\nIntellectual Property and Information Security\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is primarily dependent on our technology and our ability to innovate in business communications and, as a result, we are reliant on our intellectual property. We generally protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures to the extent our budget permits. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications that we have filed or that our patents will be sufficient to protect our key technology from misappropriation or falling into the public domain, nor can assurances be made that any of\nour patents, patent applications, trademarks or our other intellectual property or proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect theft, unauthorized use of our intellectual property or the production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products and solutions. For example, we actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights and we actively pursue counterfeiters and their distributors, but we nonetheless may lose revenue due to illegal or unauthorized use of our software. Such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions being successful against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nIn addition, our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology varies by country and may be particularly uncertain in countries that do not have well developed judicial systems or laws that adequately protect intellectual property rights. The level of protection afforded to our intellectual property may also be particularly uncertain in countries that require the transfer of technology as a condition to market access. Our partnerships with foreign entities sometimes require us to transfer technology and/or certain intellectual property rights in countries that afford less protection of intellectual property rights than other countries. While we believe such technology and intellectual property transfer requirements have not adversely affected our business, such requirements may change over time and become detrimental to our ability to protect our technology or intellectual property in certain foreign countries. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents and other proprietary rights are costly and unpredictable and may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. Financial considerations also preclude us from seeking patent protection in every country where infringement litigation could arise. Our inability to predict our intellectual property requirements in all geographies and affordability constraints also impact our intellectual property protection investment decisions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur to create our products.\nWe may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices and claims from third parties asserting that our proprietary or licensed products, systems and software infringe their intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the number of these notices and claims will not increase in the future or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights. Irrespective of the merits of these claims, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. These matters may result in any number of outcomes for us, including entering into licensing agreements, redesigning our products to avoid infringement, being enjoined from selling products or solutions that are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others, paying damages if products are found to infringe and indemnifying customers from infringement claims as part of our contractual obligations. Royalty or license agreements may be very costly and we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all which may cause operating margins to decline.\nIn addition, some of our employees previously have been employed at other companies that provide similar products and services. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. These claims and other claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have made and will likely continue to make investments to license and/or acquire the use of third-party intellectual property rights and technology as part of our strategy to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any costs relating to such activity will not be material. We may also be subject to additional notice, attribution and other compliance requirements to the extent we incorporate open source software into our applications. In addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that a customer\u2019s use of our products, systems or software infringes the third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to indemnify our customers for some of the costs and damages related to such an infringement claim. Any indemnification requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any insurance that we have may not be sufficient to cover all amounts related to such indemnification.\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of our products contain software from open source code sources. The use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code to third parties for no cost. We monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. However, the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions, which could require us to take\nremedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the European Union's (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"EU GDPR\") and the United Kingdom's (\"UK\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"UK GDPR,\" and together with the EU GDPR, \"GDPR\") and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and the GDPR imposes obligations on companies, including us, who process personal data of data subjects who are in the EU or UK, regardless of whether or not that processing takes place in the EU or UK. These requirements substantially increase potential liability for all such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules.\nPrivacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of personal information, including credit card data, provided to us by our customers as well as data we collect from our customers and employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. Our privacy compliance program is based on our binding corporate rules which have been approved by EU regulatory authorities. As the UK is no longer part of the EU, we have applied for UK binding corporate rules. We endeavor to apply uniform data handling practices, based on GDPR standards, on a global basis throughout all Avaya entities which process personal data, and have signed on to our binding corporate rules. We have dedicated significant time, capital and other resources to craft binding corporate rules that meet the requirements of the GDPR and other laws such as CCPA. Privacy laws and legal requirements relating to the transfer of personal data continue to evolve. Restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. We expect that as privacy laws continue to change and become more prevalent throughout the world, we will be required to dedicate additional resources to ensure continued compliance.\nFrom time to time we have notified authorities in the EU and UK of potential personal data breaches and privacy issues, and we keep them appropriately updated. No such disclosure has led to fines in the past and we do not anticipate any disclosure under consideration will lead to fines or other adverse outcomes. If the authorities determine that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties and lawsuits, and our reputation may suffer. Fines imposed on other companies by various data privacy regulatory authorities from the EU or UK for violations of the GDPR have been significant in amount. Furthermore, we may be subject to increased scrutiny going forward and we may also be required to make modifications to our data practices that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThese data privacy risks are particularly relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions and in the cloud solutions of other companies. We believe that regulations pertaining to the solicitation, collection, exporting, processing, and/or use of personal, financial, and consumer information will continue to expand globally. In addition, the interpretation and application of existing consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere is often uncertain and in flux. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data and privacy practices. Complying with such laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nContracts with our customers, channel partners and other third parties also subject us to privacy and data protection-related obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data or consumer protection, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties on which we rely enter into contracts to protect and safeguard our customers' data. Should such parties violate these agreements or suffer a security breach, we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation.\nA breach of the security of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on the security of our information systems and, in certain circumstances, those of our third-party providers, such as channel partners, vendors, consultants and contract manufacturers, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. In addition, the growth of bring your own device (\"BYOD\") programs has increased the need for enhanced security measures. IT security system failures, including a breach of our or our third-party providers\u2019 data security systems, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, delays in the\nfulfillment or cancellation of customer orders, disruptions in the manufacture or shipment of products or delivery of services or an unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third-party providers, information systems and our products and services may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 proprietary information.\nWe take cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and the data of our customers from intrusions and to ensure compliance with our contractual and regulatory obligations. However, these security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. Cyberattacks and similar threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Computer malware, viruses, scraping and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately insure against and address or mitigate cyberattacks or security breaches. We investigate potential data breach issues identified through our security procedures and terminate, mitigate and remediate such issues as appropriate. Past incidents have involved outside actors and issues stemming from certain internal configuration and migration issues of our applications to other platforms. A breach of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as a provider of business communications products and services and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure, either or both of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions. In addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection worldwide, such as the EU GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, and the UK GDPR, which went into effect in January 2021, may increase the costs to develop, implement or secure our products and services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. Furthermore, we may need to increase or change our cybersecurity systems and expenditures to support expansion of sales into new industry segments or new geographic markets. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined, which fines could be substantial, or otherwise sanctioned. Any such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nGlobal Operations and Regulations\nSince we operate internationally, operational, logistical, economic and/or political challenges in a specific country or region could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors.\nWe do business in approximately 190 countries. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations and significant amounts of our R&D activities in countries outside of the U.S., and we also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers and our channel partners. For fiscal 2021, we derived 43% of our revenue from sales outside of the U.S., with the most significant portions generated from Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. In addition, we intend to continue to grow our business internationally. The vast majority of our contract manufacturing also takes place outside the U.S., primarily in southern China.\nAccordingly, our results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to international business operations, including:\n\u2022economic conditions and geopolitical developments, including trade sanctions, tariffs, changes to significant trading relationships such as the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the negotiation of new or revised international trade agreements and retaliatory efforts from such trade restrictions, constraints and prohibitions, such as the U.S. China trade dispute and the EU's position on humanitarian rights towards countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asian territories;\n\u2022political or social unrest, economic instability or corruption or sovereign debt risks in a specific country or region;\n\u2022laws and regulations, both international and local, related to trade compliance, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, information security, data privacy and protection, labor, the environment, climate change and other topics and requirements;\n\u2022protectionist and local security legislation;\n\u2022difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, such as protecting against the counterfeiting of our products;\n\u2022less established legal and judicial systems necessary to enforce our rights;\n\u2022relationships with employees and works councils, as well as difficulties in finding qualified employees, including skilled design and technical employees, as companies expand their operations offshore;\n\u2022high levels of inflation and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022unfavorable tax and currency regulations;\n\u2022military conflict, terrorist activities and health pandemics or similar issues;\n\u2022future government shutdowns or uncertainties which could affect the portion of our revenues which comes from the U.S. federal government sector;\n\u2022differing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods, anywhere we and/or our channel partners and distributors have business operations; and\n\u2022other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we and our contract manufacturers and business partners currently operate or intend to operate, including in the U.S.\nAny or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, the various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and they may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws, policies and regulations. Furthermore, our prospective effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data hosting services to us or to our customers, and interruptions or delays in those services could harm our business.\nOur cloud-based solutions rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. To provide such service for our customers, we utilize data center hosting facilities located in the U.S. and the EU, as well as in our Asia Pacific region and our Central America and Latin America regions. We also use facilities provided by Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Equinix as we migrate to cloud solutions. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to service interruptions or damage from floods, earthquakes, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to acts of vandalism or terrorism, sabotage, similar misconduct and/or human error. Moreover, if any of these data centers and networks cease operations, we would need to migrate our solutions and our customers to other providers. The occurrence of these or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the ability to use our solutions efficiently or at all, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not comply with certain telecommunications or other rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nCertain of our cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Communications Commission and various state and local agencies, and across the globe by governments of various foreign countries. Furthermore, we are subject to existing or potential regulations relating to privacy, consumer protection, protection of customer information, disability access, porting of numbers, Universal Service and Telecommunications Relay Service Fund contributions, emergency access, law enforcement intercept, and other requirements. We are required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal funds in states that assess interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) services, and the expansion of telecommunications regulations in the U.S. to our non-interconnected VoIP services could result in additional federal and state regulatory obligations and taxes. In addition, as we continue to grow our business internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries where we offer services. Many of these laws and regulations are new, like the European Electronics Communications Code which regulates electronic communications networks and services in the EU, may be subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent or conflict with other rules and are constantly evolving in ways that could be harmful to our business and thereby may impact our ability to offer services and our cost to deliver services in these countries. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is uncertain, and it is possible that we or our products or solutions may not be compliant with each applicable law or regulation. If we do not comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, loss of licenses and possible restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our solutions or requirements to modify certain solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate now or in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, as regulations that may not directly apply to our business, but which do apply to our customers or partners, can also impact our business.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere have been significant changes and proposed changes in recent years to U.S. trade policies, tariffs, and treaties affecting imports. For example, the U.S. has imposed supplemental tariffs of up to 25% on certain imports from China, as well as increased tariffs and import restrictions on products imported from various other countries. In response, China and other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. The U.S. has also recently renegotiated the multilateral trading relationship between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, resulting in the replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") with a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"). Changes in U.S. trade policy have and may continue to result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose new or additional quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. As new presidential administrations take office they often assess and/or make changes to policies of previous administrations. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nFinancial Performance\nIn addition to experiencing some seasonal trends, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Fluctuations in our financial results from period to period are caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, the size and timing of new logos, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the mix of products sold by us and general economic conditions. In addition, execution of sales opportunities sometimes traverses from the intended fiscal quarter to the next.\nWe also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Typically, our second fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nShifts in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur gross margins and our operating results can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our solutions, including the sizes and types of organizations that purchase our solutions, the mix of software and hardware they purchase and the level of professional services and support they require. We provide our solutions to a broad range of companies, from small businesses to large multinational enterprises and government organizations. Sales to larger enterprises generally result in greater revenue but may take longer to negotiate and finalize than sales to small businesses. Conversely, sales to small businesses may be faster to execute than sales to larger enterprises, but they may involve greater credit risk and fewer opportunities to sell additional services. Moreover, an important element of our growth strategy is to continue to evolve from a traditional telecommunications hardware company into a software and services company, focused on expanding our cloud- and mobile-enabled contact center, unified communications and innovative next-generation workflow automation solutions. As we increase the proportion of our revenue coming from software solutions as opposed to hardware solutions, we expect to see an improvement in our gross margins and operating results but if we are unsuccessful we might not recognize these gross margin improvements. Overall, if the mix of companies that purchase our solutions, or the mix of solution components purchased by our customers, changes unfavorably, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nAt September 30, 2021, the Company had $2,235 million of intangible assets and $1,480 million of goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The intangible assets are principally composed of technology and patents, customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with determinable lives, which were $1,902 million at September 30, 2021, are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments. Although the Company did not record an impairment charge\nduring fiscal 2021, to the extent that business conditions deteriorate further, or if changes in key assumptions and estimates differ significantly from management's expectations, it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future. See Note 7, \"Goodwill\" and Note 8, \"Intangible Assets, net\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nLevels of returns on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and post-retirement benefit plan liabilities could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition in future periods.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the U.S., Canada, and various foreign locations. Pension and other post-retirement plan costs and required contributions are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets compared to obligations under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation.\nIn addition, our major defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A decline in the market value of the pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets below our projected return rates will increase the funding requirements under our pension and post-retirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans\u2019 assets compared to obligations under the pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in our defined benefit pension plans in Germany.\nWe operate several defined benefit plans in Germany (collectively, the \"German Plans\") and as of September 30, 2021, the total projected benefit obligation for the German Plans of $488 million exceeded plan assets of $4 million, resulting in an aggregate pension liability for the German Plans of $484 million. Under the German Plans, which were closed to new members in 2006, retirees generally benefit from the receipt of a perpetual annuity at retirement, based on their years of service and ending salary. The total projected benefit obligation is based on actuarial valuations, which themselves are based on assumptions and estimates about the long-term operation of the plans, including mortality rates of members, the performance of financial markets and interest rates. Our funding requirements for future years may increase from current levels depending on the net liability position of these plans. In addition, if the actual experience of the plans differs from our assumptions, the net liability could increase and additional contributions may be required. Changes to pension legislation in Germany may also adversely affect our funding requirements. Increases in the net pension liability or increases in future cash contributions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur degree of leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and expose us to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2021, we had $1,543 million of loans outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, $37 million issued and outstanding letters of credit and guarantees under the ABL Credit Agreement, $350 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2023 (the \"Convertible Notes\") and $1,000 million of 6.125% senior first lien notes due September 15, 2028 (the \"Senior Notes\") outstanding (all as defined in Part II, Item 8, Note 11, \"Financing Arrangements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, as of September 30, 2021 we could have borrowed an additional $147 million under our ABL Credit Agreement.\nOur degree of leverage could have consequences, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, research and development and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates under Avaya Inc.\u2019s credit facilities to the extent such facilities have variable rates of interest, as well as to refinancing risks as facilities mature;\n\u2022limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust quickly or at all to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nGeneral economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, may negatively affect our ability to fund our debt requirements or reduce our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could further exacerbate the risks associated with our degree of leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Term Loan and ABL Credit Agreements and the indenture for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the indenture for the Convertible Notes does not restrict us from incurring additional debt. To the extent we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt beyond anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nOur financing agreements contain restrictions that limit, in certain respects, our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur financing agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt and issue or sell certain preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022sell assets to, or merge or consolidate with, another company.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In particular, we intend to increase our recurring revenue by shifting more of our business to a subscription-based model. If we successfully increase our subscription revenues, we expect this will result in more of our cash receipts being deferred relative to our historical perpetual license model as payments are spread over a pre-determined time period (e.g., annually) rather than being received upfront, which may defer cash flows needed to service our debt. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to try to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, which may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations when due. If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable secured lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nA ratings downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization could adversely affect our cost of capital.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. Any adverse developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade for Avaya Holdings Corp., Avaya Inc. or any of our rated debt securities. In addition, the condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have been, and will continue to be, subject to fluctuation. Any fluctuation in our credit rating may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and that, in addition to changes in interest rates, could increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes\nThe price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock, as well as our Convertible Notes (as they are convertible into our common stock), may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022political dynamics in the countries we operate in;\n\u2022fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022high levels of inflation and other decreases in purchasing power;\n\u2022variances in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts;\n\u2022conditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022announcements of significant new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022additions of or changes to key employees;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022trading volumes of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes;\n\u2022future sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness;\n\u2022changes in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets;\n\u2022legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u2022hedging or arbitrage trading activity by third parties, including by the counterparties to the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes; and\n\u2022dilution that may occur upon any conversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock or the Convertible Notes or the exercise of the warrants we issued in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and/or Convertible Notes irrespective of our operating performance.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock dilutes the relative voting power and ownership of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to an Investment Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019, by and between us and RingCentral, we sold 125,000 shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) to RingCentral on October 31, 2019 (the \u201cClosing\u201d).\nAs of September 30, 2021, the preferred stock held by RingCentral represented approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $16.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Certificate of Designations which details the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. In any such vote, RingCentral's aggregate voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock and other shares of our common stock which may be issued to them under that certain Framework Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019, by and between Avaya Inc. and RingCentral (the \"Framework Agreement\"), will be limited, prior to our receipt of an approval by our stockholders as required under New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual Rule 312.03 (\u201cStockholder Approval\u201d), to the voting power equivalent to no more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock. If Stockholder Approval is obtained, this limitation will no longer apply. Notwithstanding that limit, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock to RingCentral effectively reduces the relative voting\npower of the holders of our common stock. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Framework Agreement, RingCentral paid Avaya $375 million, predominantly for future fees, as well as for certain licensing rights, and RingCentral will have the right to convert still outstanding amounts into shares of our common stock or our Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of such additional shares and any sales in the public market of such common stock or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We granted RingCentral customary registration rights in respect of any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and have filed a registration statement permitting the resale by RingCentral of the common stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock in compliance with this obligation. As a result, subject to certain exceptions, RingCentral will be able to freely sell the common stock it will hold following conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. Sales by RingCentral of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nAs a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, RingCentral is entitled to:\n\u2022receive dividends, in preference and priority to holders of our common stock or other series of Company stock, which will accrue on a daily basis at the rate of 3% per annum of the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock is initially $1,000 per share and it will be increased by the sum of any dividends on such shares not paid in cash. These dividends are cumulative, compound quarterly and are paid quarterly in arrears.\n\u2022participate in any dividends we pay on our common stock, equal to the dividend which holders would have received if their Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock on the date such common stock dividend was determined.\n\u2022receive, in the event our Company is liquidated or dissolved, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock, an amount equal to the liquidation preference (which equals the stated value referenced above plus any accrued and unpaid dividends) for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held.\n\u2022consent rights with respect to certain actions by us, including amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series A Preferred Stock and issuing securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\u2022nominate one person for election to our Board of Directors, who our Board of Directors will recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of, until such time when RingCentral and its affiliates hold or beneficially own less than 4,759,339 shares of our common stock (on an as-converted basis).\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, to the extent that we need to amend our organizational documents, whether to seek to raise capital in the form of senior preferred stock or another reason, and RingCentral does not provide its consent to any such issuance or amendment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or liquidity.\nRingCentral has certain redemption or put rights to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock for cash. We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance such a required repurchase.\nRingCentral has certain redemption or put rights to require us, to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock for cash. RingCentral can exercise such redemption rights, upon at least 21 days\u2019 notice, after the termination of the Framework Agreement or upon the occurrence of certain events. If and to the extent this redemption right is exercised, we would have to purchase each share of Series A Preferred Stock at the per share price equal to the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock, which is initially $1,000 per share and which will be increased by the sum of any dividends on such shares, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nIt is possible that we would not have sufficient funds to make any required repurchase of Series A Preferred Stock and we may not be able to arrange financing, to pay the repurchase price.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and/or the market for our common stock.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be\nentitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. If we elect to satisfy this obligation by delivering common stock it would have a dilutive effect on our other stockholders. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge (\"Bond Hedge\") transaction with each of Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Capital LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the \"Call Spread Counterparties\"). The Bond Hedge transactions reduced the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We also entered into a warrant (\"Call Spread Warrant\") transaction with each of the Call Spread Counterparties. The Call Spread Warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the Call Spread Warrants.\nEach of the Call Spread Counterparties (or an affiliate) may modify its initial hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect the ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nSignificant exercises of equity awards or warrants or conversion of preferred stock or convertible debt could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had 84,115,602 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include 5,178,288 shares and 5,645,200 shares that may be issued upon the exercise or vesting of equity awards and warrants issued upon emergence from bankruptcy, respectively. In addition, we have the ability to issue an additional 10,750,733 equity awards tied to our common stock under our currently authorized equity incentive plans. Furthermore, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Notes is 16,393,440 and our Series A Preferred Stock issued to RingCentral is convertible into 8,150,392 shares of common stock as of September 30, 2021. The exercise of equity awards and warrants and the conversion of our convertible debt instruments and preferred stock could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, will reduce the percentage of common stock held by the Company\u2019s current stockholders and may cause its current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market.\nOur governing documents contain provisions which may disadvantage our stockholders, by impeding or discouraging a takeover and limiting stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions which could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of our preferred stock and Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis forum selection provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and the duration and extent to which this will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and/or cash flows remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures are having a negative impact on regional, national and global economies, disrupting supply chains and reducing international trade and business activity. The pandemic has caused many governments throughout the world to implement stay-at-home orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, social distancing measures including restrictions that prohibit many employees from commuting to their customary work locations and regulations detailing specific return to office conditions, all of which may require these employees to work remotely if possible. Many of these restrictions have remained in place for months and in light of the emergence of new variants, may continue in one fashion or another for the foreseeable future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted us to date but may affect our operations in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Our ability to operate, as well as our partners' and/or customers' ability to operate, has been and may continue to be hindered, which may cause our business and operating results to decline.\n\u2022The inability of our employees to access customers' sites may hinder our ability to offer services that can only be provided on site, as well as our ability to make in person sales visits and demonstrations.\n\u2022Clients and customers have had and may continue to have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us, resulting in late or non-payment of amounts owed.\n\u2022We may experience significant reductions or volatility in demand for our solutions as customers may not be able to enter into new purchase commitments or otherwise invest in their business due to financial downturns or general economic uncertainty.\n\u2022We may experience temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs, which may significantly impact our distribution network, results of operations (including sales) or business.\n\u2022To the extent a number of our employees, including our executive officers and other members of our management team, are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022We may not be able to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations and crisis management plans are not effective or are improperly implemented.\n\u2022The significant disruption of global financial markets, which has impacted the value of our common stock and could further materially impact the value of our stock in the future, may reduce our ability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and could affect our business in the near and long-term.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, financial performance and liquidity, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, changes in infection rates, the vaccine participation rate, the effectiveness of vaccines and the speed with which the vaccine can be distributed, as well as regulations and requirements impacting the return to our offices and/or our ability to visit customer sites, none of which can be predicted. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Additionally, as pandemic conditions wane, we cannot predict how quickly the marketplaces in which we operate will return to pre-pandemic levels.\nOur ability to retain and attract key personnel is critical to the success of our business and execution of our growth strategy.\nThe success of our business depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employee base. If we are unable to retain and recruit sufficiently experienced and capable employees, including those who can help us increase revenues generated from our cloud-based solutions and services, our business and financial results may suffer. Experienced and capable employees in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity and/or errors due to insufficient staffing or managerial oversight. Moreover, turnover of senior management and other key personnel can adversely impact, among other things, our operating results, our customer relationships and lead us to incur significant expenses related to executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. In addition, our ability to adequately staff our R&D efforts in the U.S. may be inhibited by COVID-19 and/or changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional and technical talent.\nWhile we strive to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the employees that we need to achieve our business objectives.\nBusiness and/or supply chain interruptions, whether due to catastrophic disasters or other events, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations and those of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood or other natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, computer systems failure, telecommunications failure, pandemics, quarantines, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war and other events beyond our control. For instance, we have operations in the Silicon Valley area of California near known earthquake fault zones, which are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. Our disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to address these interruptions. If any disaster were to occur, our ability and the ability of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers to operate could be seriously impaired and we could experience material harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. Because our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our operations could harm our reputation as a reliable solutions provider. In addition, the coverage or limits of our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses or damages that may occur.\nIn addition, these catastrophic disasters or other events, such as the global shortage of semiconductor chips, could lead to supply chain disruptions, restrictions on our ability to distribute our products and restrictions on our abilities to provide services in the regions affected. Any prolonged and significant supply chain disruption that impacts us or our customers, partners, vendors and/or suppliers, or an inability to provide products or services, would likely impact our sales in the affected region, increase our costs and negatively affect our operating results. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic, which we saw in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 adversely affected the global economy and financial markets, resulting in an economic downturn that affected demand for our products and services and likely impacted our operating results. Similarly, the decrease in the availability of global shipping has raised freight and shipping costs and there are no assurances that such shipping disruptions and higher logistics costs will not continue or increase, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost-reduction initiatives.\nFrom time to time we may initiate cost savings programs designed to streamline operations. As discussed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations,\" we have initiated such programs historically, and we will continue to evaluate similar opportunities to the extent the business need arises. These types of cost-reduction activities are complex. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we expect, we may not be able to achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate or on the timetables we anticipate. Any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and, as a result, our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to realize gross margin improvements and other efficiencies expected to result from these initiatives is subject to many risks, including delays in the anticipated timing of activities, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, our success in reinvesting any savings arising from these initiatives, time required to complete planned actions, absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions and avoidance of unexpected disruptions in service. A failure to implement these types of initiatives or realize expected benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition that could be material.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our clients and customers, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nMost of our sales in the U.S. have standard payment terms of 30 days and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the U.S. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our solutions and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with installation and integration of our solutions and services.\nWe have a thorough credit process for extending credit limits to our customers, which considers the financial profile of our end user customers in addition to that of the direct customer, distributor or channel partner. We evaluate numerous factors in extending credit, which may include credit ratings, financial performance and discussions with customers. Notwithstanding that, our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by periods of economic uncertainty or a global economic downturn. For instance, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain clients and customers have had and may continue to have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us, resulting in late or non-payment of amounts owed. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized or the Company's solutions and devices are sold. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions including the U.S. may be subject to change. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nIf the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Any new U.S. or international tax legislation could modify existing rules, limit certain deductions and/or impose new taxes, any of which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nTax examinations and audits could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other U.S. or foreign tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are a global company with significant international operations and we transact business in many currencies. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary currency exposures relate to net operating expenses denominated in Euro, Indian Rupee and Argentine Peso. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and the geographic mix of our business changes. In addition, a portion of our borrowings bears interest at prevailing interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. Therefore, we are subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. From time to time we use derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain intercompany obligations, as well as to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates. The measures we have taken to help mitigate these risks are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, any attempts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate and/or interest rate fluctuation risk may be unsuccessful and result in an adverse impact to our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and we are also required to establish disclosure controls and procedures under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules. An effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud. Management is required to provide an annual assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our and our auditor\u2019s testing may reveal significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. In the past, these assessments and similar reviews have led to the discovery of material weaknesses, all of which have been remediated. However, no assurance can be given that we will not discover material weaknesses in the future. In addition, the effectiveness of an internal control system is inherently limited and we cannot assure you that our internal controls will prevent or detect every misstatement or omission. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses:\n\u2022we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations;\n\u2022our reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed;\n\u2022the market price of our stock could decline; and\n\u2022we could be subject to litigation and/or investigations or sanctions by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange or other regulatory authorities.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 17234, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AVYA"}
