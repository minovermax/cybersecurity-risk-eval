Risk Factors\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nSAFE HARBOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including exhibits, contains statements that are not based on historical facts and represent forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that TDS intends, expects, projects, believes, estimates, plans or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Each of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. However, such factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. TDS undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to TDS\u2019 business.\nOperational Risk Factors\n1)Intense competition involving products, services, pricing, promotions and network speed and technologies could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the wireless industry is intense and is expected to intensify in the future due to multiple factors such as increasing market penetration, introduction of new products, new competitors, increasing promotional aggressiveness and changing prices. There is competition in service plan pricing; handsets and other devices; promotional discounts; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies, including 5G technology; distribution; new entrants; bundled services and products, such as content; and other categories. In particular, wireless competition includes aggressive service plan and device pricing, including pricing for unlimited plans, which could result in switching activity and churn and limit TDS\u2019 ability to monetize future growth in data usage. In addition, competition based on network speed may increase as customer demand for higher speeds increases. TDS anticipates that these competitive factors may cause the prices for services and products to decline and the costs to compete to increase.\nTDS\u2019 primary wireless competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than TDS, possess greater financial and other resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that TDS does not offer. TDS and its competitors are actively marketing their deployment of 5G and, as a result, are raising consumer awareness of the technology. If TDS cannot keep pace with its competitors in deploying 5G or other comparable offerings, or if TDS' deployment of 5G technology does not result in significant incremental revenues, TDS' financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected. In addition, new technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by TDS may be developed and create new sources of competition. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that TDS is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that TDS will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to TDS\u2019 wireless business typically include two to four competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including MVNOs), and providers of alternative telecommunications services. Many of TDS\u2019 wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than TDS.\nCompetition in the wireline industry is intensified with the increasing deployment of broadband technologies and enhanced video services. Incumbent carriers are upgrading existing networks with higher speed broadband services and overbuilders are deploying broadband to compete with legacy incumbent carriers. Overbuilding activity is increasing with investments by venture capital and private equity. Sources of competition to TDS\u2019 wireline and cable businesses include, but are not limited to, resellers of local exchange services, interexchange carriers, incumbent carriers, satellite broadband providers, wireless communications providers, other cable companies, access providers, fiber overbuilders, VoIP providers and providers using other emerging technologies. Customers may choose to substitute their wireline services using satellite, wireless and other technologies, which may be preferred to technologies offered by TDS. Customers may demand the bundling of wireline and wireless services. If TDS cannot keep pace with its competition in deploying higher speed technologies, offering competitive prices and providing attractive video content options, TDS' financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected.\n2)Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause TDS\u2019 roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of TDS\u2019 network by other wireless carriers\u2019 customers who travel within TDS\u2019 coverage areas. Changes in FCC rules or actions, industry practices or the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap TDS\u2019 network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for TDS.\nSimilarly, TDS\u2019 wireless customers can access another carrier\u2019s network automatically only if the other carrier allows TDS\u2019 customers to roam on its network. TDS relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. and internationally outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of TDS\u2019 network footprint. Although TDS has entered into roaming agreements with national carriers, there is no assurance that TDS will be able to maintain these agreements and/or enter into new agreements with other carriers to provide roaming services or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost-effective terms.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than TDS is able to obtain because they have larger data usage or call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality and availability of services that a wireless carrier delivers to a TDS customer while roaming may be inferior or limited in comparison to the service TDS provides. TDS\u2019 rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data and voice services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, TDS\u2019 wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of TDS to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. Carriers whose customers roam on TDS\u2019 network could switch their business to new operators, limit their high-speed usage or, over time, move traffic to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming usage, or roaming relationships with other carriers could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 roaming revenues and/or expenses.\nTo the extent that other carriers expand their networks in TDS\u2019 service areas, the roaming arrangements between TDS and these other carriers could become less strategic for them. That is, these other carriers will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to TDS in that, to the extent TDS is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with these other carriers, this could impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network.\n3)A failure by TDS to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 wireless business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. TDS could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity, including spectrum needed to support 5G technology, in new or existing markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services and network speed, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. TDS believes that this increased demand for data services and network speed reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Data usage, including usage under unlimited plans, could exceed current forecasts resulting in a need for increased investment in spectrum or other network components. TDS could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in plan offerings, customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of TDS\u2019 services or TDS\u2019 ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that TDS curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, adds fixed operating costs, is limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective. Further, a spectrum constrained provider will generally not be able to achieve the data speeds that other competitors with more spectrum are able to provide.\nTDS may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including acquisitions, exchanges and participation in spectrum auctions. TDS may participate in spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for wireless spectrum licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain wireless spectrum licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, TDS may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining access to the spectrum that it believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies.\nAccess to wireless spectrum licenses won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting wireless spectrum licenses won, which can be rescinded or delayed for various reasons, including but not limited to exceeding spectrum ownership and attribution limits, and safety concerns due to interference with other spectrum bands. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations. TDS also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees. However, TDS may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and TDS may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n4)An inability to attract people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 businesses are highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the telecommunications industry is intense. Due to competition, limited supply, and/or rising wage levels for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that TDS will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. In addition, transitioning to a new remote or hybrid working model and applicability of health protocols such as vaccination requirements could negatively affect talent acquisition and retention. The loss of existing key personnel due to competition, wage levels and/or retirements, the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner, the inability to foster and maintain a diverse and inclusive work environment, or failure to maintain its commitment to environmental and social responsibility could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for highly skilled leaders in the telecommunications industry also is extremely competitive. The future success of TDS and its businesses depends in substantial part on TDS\u2019 ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly skilled leaders for all areas of its organization. The loss of any of TDS\u2019 key leaders could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to TDS\u2019 long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employees could also adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\n5)TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than TDS could cause TDS to be unable to compete successfully, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications and related industries towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. TDS has smaller scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. TDS may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than TDS, which could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u25aaLow profit margins and returns on investment that are below TDS\u2019 cost of capital;\n\u25aaIncreased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u25aaInability to timely and successfully deploy 5G or other wireless technologies, execute on wireline fiber expansion plans, or to realize significant incremental revenues from their deployment;\n\u25aaLimited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless, wireline and cable companies with greater scale and scope;\n\u25aaLimited access to content, as well as limited ability to obtain acceptably priced content and programming;\n\u25aaConsumer expectations that TDS provides lower-priced wireless offerings relative to larger competitors;\n\u25aaLimited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u25aaReduced ability to invest in research and development of new services and products;\n\u25aaLower risk tolerance when evaluating new markets;\n\u25aaVendors may deem TDS non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to TDS, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u25aaLimited access to intellectual property; and\n\u25aaOther limited opportunities such as for software development or third-party distribution.\nTDS\u2019 businesses depend on access to content for data and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. TDS\u2019 ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If TDS is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n6)Changes in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aaDemand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u25aaConsumer preferences, including internet speed and type of wireless devices;\n\u25aaConsumer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u25aaConsumer expectations for self-service options through digital means;\n\u25aaCompetitive pressure to deliver higher speed;\n\u25aaCompetitive pressure from promotional activity;\n\u25aaThe pricing of services, including an increase in price-based competition;\n\u25aaInflationary pressures on costs without corresponding price increases for TDS' services;\n\u25aaAccess to and cost of programming;\n\u25aaThe overall size and growth rate of TDS\u2019 customer base;\n\u25aaPenetration rates;\n\u25aaChurn rates;\n\u25aaSelling expenses;\n\u25aaNet customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u25aaCustomers\u2019 ability to pay for services and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u25aaRoaming agreements and rates;\n\u25aaThird-party vendor support;\n\u25aaCapacity constraints;\n\u25aaThe mix of services and products offered by TDS and purchased by customers; and\n\u25aaThe costs of providing services and products.\n7)Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could put TDS at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce TDS\u2019 revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers, as evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Also, high-speed wireless networks (wireless broadband) represent a product offering and opportunity for TDS\u2019 wireless business, but also represent a risk for TDS\u2019 wireline and cable businesses as customers may elect to substitute their wireline or cable broadband connection with wireless broadband. Further, fixed-mobile convergence services that combine wireline broadband services with mobile services represent a competitive threat. If the trend toward convergence continues, TDS is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other technologies to equal or exceed TDS\u2019 current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. TDS may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business.\n8)Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and TDS\u2019 investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that TDS expects.\nTDS' wireless business is deploying 5G technology in its network and has launched commercial 5G services in portions of substantially all of its markets. The continued deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in TDS' wireless networks to remain competitive in the industry. Transition to 5G or other new technologies involves significant time, cost and risk, and anticipated products and revenues may not be realized. Furthermore, the wireless business experiences rapid technology changes and new services and products. If TDS fails to effectively deploy new wireless technologies, services or products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 wireline and cable businesses are deploying fiber-to-the-home technology, advanced wireline, broadband, and TDS TV+ services through fiber-to-the-node, copper bonding, vectoring and DOCSIS 3.1 technology. A significant amount of the product development and integration risks are borne by TDS. Further, the simultaneous rollout of these advanced services and technologies increases the execution risk. If TDS fails to effectively deploy new technologies and products on a timely basis or if conditions occur that limit interpersonal sales efforts, this could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, it is not certain that TDS\u2019 investments in various new, unproven technologies and the related service and product offerings will be effective. The markets for some of these services, products and solutions may still be emerging and the overall potential for these markets, including revenues to be realized, may be uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n9)Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of TDS\u2019 businesses could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of TDS\u2019 operating strategy, TDS from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. TDS may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, TDS may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached. These transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25aaIdentification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of TDS\u2019 businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u25aaCompetition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u25aaInability to make acquisitions that would achieve sufficient scale to be competitive with competitors with greater scale;\n\u25aaPossible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that TDS desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u25aaAbility to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aaSignificant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aaRisks associated with integrating new businesses or markets, including risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy;\n\u25aaAbility to enter markets in which TDS has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u25aaAbility to integrate and manage TDS\u2019 different business operations and services, including wireless services, traditional wireline services and cable businesses;\n\u25aaUncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions or the entry into new expansion markets, with the result that TDS may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n\u25aaDifficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u25aaDiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25aaDisruption of ongoing business;\n\u25aaImpact on TDS\u2019 cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u25aaInability to retain key personnel;\n\u25aaInability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into TDS\u2019 service offerings;\n\u25aaInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25aaPossible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u25aaImpairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that TDS will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives.\n10)A failure by TDS to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nTDS\u2019 business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network, support and other systems and infrastructure. Additionally, the deployment of new wireless technologies, including 5G, may require substantial investments in TDS' wireless network. As TDS deploys, expands and enhances its wireless network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as TDS continues to build out and enhance its network, TDS must, among other things, continue to:\n\u25aaLease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites, transport facilities or other facilities;\n\u25aaObtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u25aaComplete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of TDS\u2019 wireless markets; and\n\u25aaImprove, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, labor availability, inflation or other pressures on costs, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay implementation and deployment of new technologies, delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully deploy new technologies, including 5G, and/or build-out and enhance TDS\u2019 network, support facilities and other systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies consumers' expectations, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 wireline and cable businesses are devoting an increasing amount of capital for fiber overbuilds and expansion into new markets. TDS is often reliant on third parties for items such as construction, franchises, utility easements, aerial attachments and other permits. Difficulties in gaining acceptance from new market communities could cause delays or additional costs. Any difficulties in supply chain constraints or labor shortages, as well as scaling up project management, engineering and construction resources could delay construction and expansion of operations in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to gain acceptance in new communities and successfully scale up resources could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n11)Difficulties involving third parties with which TDS does business, including changes in TDS\u2019 relationships with or financial or operational difficulties, including supply chain disruptions, of key suppliers or independent agents and third party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services, could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has relationships with independent agents and third-party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services.\nTDS depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment, services and content that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to continue its network construction and upgrades, and to operate its business. TDS depends upon certain vendors to provide it with wireless devices that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to support sales. TDS does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. Further, key suppliers may experience supply chain challenges beyond their control that result in difficulties providing the services and products typically requested by TDS on a timely basis. If these key suppliers (i) experience product availability shortages, (ii) require extended lead times to fulfill orders, (iii) experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties or (iv) deem TDS non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to TDS, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies, they may not provide equipment, services or content to TDS on a timely basis, or at all, or they may otherwise fail to honor their obligations to TDS. Furthermore, consolidation among key suppliers may result in less competition, higher prices, the discontinuation of equipment and/or services typically purchased by TDS or the discontinuation of support for equipment owned by TDS.\nOperation of TDS\u2019 supply chain and management of its device inventory and network equipment require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand. If overall demand for devices and equipment or the mix of demand for devices and equipment is significantly different than TDS\u2019 expectations, TDS could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of devices and equipment. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of device inventory. If network equipment is not available or requires extended lead times due to supply chain challenges, or if overall demand for wireless services or the mix of demand for wireless services is significantly different than TDS' expectations, TDS may not be able to adequately maintain a network that supports customer demand. Further, TDS' supply chain could be disrupted unexpectedly by raw material shortages, wars, natural disasters, disease or other factors. Supply chain disruptions may result in limited component availability, constraints on certain devices, extended lead times, delayed construction and additional uncertainty.\nAlso, TDS has other arrangements with third parties, including arrangements pursuant to which TDS outsources certain support functions to third-party vendors. Operational problems associated with such functions, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, including possible cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security, data protection or privacy, could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n12)A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technologies, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technologies to operate and manage its businesses, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technologies are subject to obsolescence and, consequently, must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging.\nThe increased provision of data services, including IPTV, has introduced significant demands on TDS\u2019 network and also has increased complexities related to network management. As it relates to wireline networks, the transition to IP-based networks from well-established time-division multiplexing networks requires support tools and technician skills. Further, this transition requires the use of more leased facilities and partnerships which require enhanced network monitoring and controls. The IP-based networks also generally require more electronics on customers\u2019 premises which introduces more technical risks and makes diagnostics and repairs more difficult.\nFurther, the increased provision of data services on TDS\u2019 networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service and data speeds. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of TDS\u2019 network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. TDS\u2019 ability to maintain high-quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, TDS\u2019 networks and information technologies and the networks and information technologies of vendors on which TDS relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, severe weather, adverse climate changes, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\nFinancial Risk Factors\n13)Uncertainty in TDS\u2019 future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, changes in interest rates, other changes in TDS\u2019 performance or market conditions, changes in TDS\u2019 credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases and/or the payment of dividends.\nTDS and its subsidiaries operate capital-intensive businesses. Historically, TDS has used internally-generated funds and also has obtained substantial funds from external sources for general corporate purposes. In the past, TDS\u2019 existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, funds from other financing sources, including term loans and other long-term debt, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for TDS to meet its normal day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets and to fund acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the amount of permissible borrowings under the existing revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, to put in place new credit agreements, or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund potential expenditures. TDS\u2019 liquidity would be adversely affected if, among other things, TDS is unable to obtain short or long-term financing on acceptable terms, interest rates increase, TDS makes significant spectrum license purchases, TDS makes significant capital investments, TDS makes significant business acquisitions, the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (LA Partnership) discontinues or significantly reduces distributions compared to historical levels, or Federal USF and/or other regulatory support payments decline.\nTDS\u2019 credit rating currently is sub-investment grade. TDS has incurred negative free cash flow (defined as Cash flows from operating activities less Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment) at times in the past and this could occur in the future. TDS may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, funding day-to-day operating needs including working capital, acquisitions of providers of cable, wireless or wireline telecommunications services, or other businesses, spectrum license or system acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, the repurchase of shares, the payment of dividends, or making additional investments. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to TDS or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to TDS. Insufficient cash flows from operating activities, changes in TDS' credit ratings, defaults of the terms of debt or credit agreements, uncertainty of access to capital, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in the performance of TDS or in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its acquisition, capital expenditure and business development programs, reduce the acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, reduce or cease share repurchases and/or the payment of dividends. TDS cannot provide assurance that circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources will not occur.\n14)TDS has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt.\nTDS has a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur additional indebtedness. TDS\u2019 level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it (i) may limit TDS\u2019 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to its debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward; (ii) will require TDS to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to TDS for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, capital expenditures, acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, payment of dividends, marketing spending and expansion of its business; and (iii) may limit TDS\u2019 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make TDS more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to TDS\u2019 competitors. TDS\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on its indebtedness or to refinance it will depend on its financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and other factors beyond its control.\nThe TDS and UScellular revolving credit agreements, the TDS and UScellular term loan agreements and the UScellular receivables securitization agreement require TDS or UScellular, as applicable, to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants. Depending on the actual financial performance of TDS and UScellular, there is a risk that TDS and/or UScellular could fail to satisfy the required financial covenants. If TDS or UScellular breach a financial or other covenant of any of these agreements, it would result in a default under that agreement, and could involve a cross-default under other debt instruments. This could in turn cause the affected lenders to accelerate the repayment of principal and accrued interest on any outstanding debt under such agreements and, if they choose, terminate the agreement. If appropriate, TDS and UScellular may request an amendment to one or more credit agreements to adjust financial covenants in order to provide additional financial flexibility to TDS and UScellular, and may also seek other changes to such agreements. There is no assurance that the lenders will agree to any amendments. If the lenders agree to amendments, this may result in additional payments or higher interest rates payable to the lenders and/or additional restrictions. Restrictions in such debt instruments may limit TDS\u2019 operating and financial flexibility.\nAs a result, TDS\u2019 level of indebtedness, restrictions contained in debt instruments and/or possible breaches of covenants, defaults, and acceleration of indebtedness could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n15)TDS\u2019 assets and revenue are concentrated primarily in the U.S. telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nThe U.S. telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. TDS\u2019 focus on the U.S. telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 ability to attain and sustain long-term, profitable revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n16)TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. TDS\u2019 interests in such entities do not provide TDS with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. TDS cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of TDS\u2019 investments, that TDS\u2019 proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that TDS will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain investments have historically contributed significant cash flows to TDS and a reduction or suspension of such cash flows could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition.\nRegulatory, Legal and Governance Risk Factors\n17)Failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Changes in the administration of the various regulatory agencies and legislative bodies could result in different policies with respect to many federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes to fiscal and tax policies, trade policies, tariffs on import goods and climate change. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase TDS\u2019 costs and divert resources from other initiatives. Adverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact TDS\u2019 operations by, among other things, restricting energy consumption or access to grid electricity, permitting greater competition or limiting TDS\u2019 ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities, or retention and recruitment of skilled resources. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or increased capital expenditures, lost revenues, higher operating expenses or other changes. Court decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on TDS\u2019 operations, including rulemakings on broadband access to the internet, intercarrier access compensation, state and federal support funding, and treatment of VoIP traffic or unbundled network elements. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay TDS\u2019 ability to respond to new regulations. Further, wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC and could be revoked in the event of a violation of applicable laws or regulatory requirements. Also, although FCC rules relating to net neutrality have been repealed, the FCC, and federal and state legislators may seek to reinstate net neutrality in some form and some state legislators and regulators are seeking to or have already enacted state net neutrality laws and regulations. Interpretation and application of these rules, including conflicts between federal and state laws, may result in additional costs for compliance and may limit opportunities to derive profits from certain business practices or resources.\nTDS attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, TDS is unable to predict the future actions of the various legislative and regulatory bodies that govern TDS, and such actions could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business.\n18)TDS receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments - the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to great uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTelecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in \u201chigh cost\u201d areas. UScellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received $92 million in high cost support for service to high cost areas in 2021. TDS Telecom also received support under the Connect America Fund support program. The A-CAM program has build-out requirements that if not met, would result in penalties and loss of support. In 2021, TDS Telecom received $112 million under all federal regulatory support programs. There is no assurance that regulatory support payments will continue, and no assurance that UScellular or TDS Telecom will qualify for future regulatory support programs. If regulatory support is discontinued or reduced from current levels, or if receipt of future regulatory support is contingent upon making certain network-related expenditures, this could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or operating results.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to TDS\u2019 services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether TDS has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees TDS currently pays. In some instances, TDS passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on TDS to customers. TDS may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service.\n19)Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on TDS\u2019 current or future manner of doing business.\n20)The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices or frequencies used by other industries, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. There may also be safety concerns related to frequencies used by wireless devices interfering with frequencies used by other industries, including but not limited to, the recent concerns of the Federal Aviation Administration regarding potential interference of 5G deployment with altimeters used by aircraft, which could impact deployment of certain wireless spectrum. TDS is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose TDS to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using a wireless device while driving may impair a driver's attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries.\n21)Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict TDS\u2019 access to devices or network equipment critical to providing services to customers. If technology that TDS uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, TDS could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. TDS also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or TDS\u2019 inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force TDS to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that TDS\u2019 products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of TDS\u2019 management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, TDS cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although TDS generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that TDS will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties.\n22)Certain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS or have other consequences.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the TDS bylaws contain provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS without the support of the TDS Voting Trust and the TDS Board of Directors or without meeting various other conditions.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of different series of common stock, which have different voting rights. The TDS Series A Common Shares have the power to elect approximately 75% (less one) of the directors and have ten votes per share in matters other than the election of directors. The TDS Common Shares (with one vote per share) vote as a separate group only with respect to the election of 25% (plus one) of the directors. In addition, the total percentages of voting power in matters other than the election of directors of the Series A Common Shares and Common Shares are fixed, at 56.7% and 43.3%, respectively, subject to adjustment due to changes in the number of outstanding Series A Common Shares.\nA substantial majority of the outstanding TDS Series A Common Shares are held in the TDS Voting Trust which expires on June 30, 2035. The TDS Voting Trust was created to facilitate the long-standing relationships among the certificate holders. By virtue of the number of shares held by them, the voting trustees have the power to elect eight directors based on the current TDS Board of Directors\u2019 size of twelve directors, and control a majority of the voting power of TDS with respect to matters other than the election of directors.\nThe existence of the TDS Voting Trust is likely to deter any potential unsolicited or hostile takeover attempts or other efforts to obtain control of TDS and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of TDS at higher than market prices. The trustees of the TDS Voting Trust have advised TDS that they intend to maintain the ability to keep or dispose of voting control of TDS.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to designate and issue TDS Undesignated Shares in one or more classes or series of preferred or common stock from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional TDS Undesignated Shares authorized pursuant to the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such TDS Undesignated Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve control of TDS\u2019 then existing management.\nIn addition, the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision which authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to consider various factors, including effects on customers, taxes, and the long-term and short-term interests of TDS, in the context of a proposal or offer to acquire or merge the corporation, or to sell its assets, and to reject such offer if the TDS Board of Directors determines that the proposal is not in the best interests of the corporation based on such factors.\nThe provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the TDS bylaws and the existence of various classes of capital stock could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of TDS by delaying or preventing such change in control.\nThe provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the existence of different classes of capital stock and voting rights could result in the exclusion of TDS Common Shares from certain major stock indices at some point in the future, unless TDS is grandfathered by such stock indices or qualifies for some other exception.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n23)TDS has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. These include cyber-attacks intended to wrongfully obtain private and valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events, including denial of service attacks which may cause TDS' services to be disrupted or unavailable to customers. The increasing number of associates working remotely increases risks associated with data handling and vulnerability management. TDS maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date TDS has not discovered a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, TDS could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, TDS may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. TDS continues to experience denial of service attacks. Although TDS has implemented and continues to enhance its protection and recovery measures in response to such attacks, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material denial of service attack in the future.\n24)Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede TDS\u2019 access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth, increased tariffs on import goods, sudden increases in inflation and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, changes in U.S. trade policies, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n25)The impact of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on TDS' business is uncertain, but depending on duration and severity could have a material adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPublic health emergencies, such as COVID-19, pose the risk that TDS or its associates, agents, partners and suppliers may be unable to conduct business activities for an extended period of time and/or provide the level of service expected. TDS' ability to attract customers, maintain an adequate supply chain and execute on its business strategies and initiatives could be negatively impacted by public health emergencies. Additionally, public health emergencies could cause increased unemployment and an economic downturn, both of which could negatively impact TDS. The extent of the impact of public health emergencies on TDS' business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the emergency, actions taken by governmental authorities and other possible direct and indirect consequences, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.", "PERMNO": 90655, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "TDS"}
