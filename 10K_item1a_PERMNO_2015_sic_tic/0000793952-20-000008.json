{"cik": "793952", "company": "HARLEY-DAVIDSON, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in Harley-Davidson, Inc. involves risks, including those discussed below. These risk factors should be considered carefully before deciding whether to invest in the Company.\n\u2022\nThe Company may not be able to successfully execute its short-term and long-term business plans and strategies. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to execute its business plans and strategies, including the elements of the More Roads plan for growth that the Company disclosed on July 30, 2018 and updated September 24, 2019, and strengthen its existing business while enabling growth. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the objectives, milestones, outlooks, and goals in the More Roads plan depends upon, among other factors, the Company\u2019s ability to: (i) realize expectations concerning market demand for electric, middleweight, and small-displacement models, which may depend in part on the building of necessary infrastructure, (ii) develop and introduce products on a timely basis that the market accepts, that enable the Company to generate desired sales levels and that provide the desired financial returns, (iii) successfully carry out its global manufacturing and assembly operations, (iv) manage risks that arise through expanding international manufacturing, operations and sales, (v) effectively implement changes relating to its dealers and distribution methods, (vi) accurately analyze, predict and react to changing market conditions, (vii) perform in a manner that enables the Company to benefit from market opportunities while competing against existing and new competitors, (viii) reduce other costs to offset costs of the More Roads plan and redirect capital without adversely affecting its existing operations, and (ix) avoid adverse impacts to its operations and/or demand for its products that may result from widespread infectious disease, in particular as it relates to its small displacement plans in Asia. Without limitation, the Company sees 2020 as the pivotal year in the transformation of the Company under the More Roads plan, and the Company faces challenges, risks and uncertainties in executing the plan. As a result, the Company may not realize its expectation of significant growth in 2021 or its goals for 2022 under the plan. The Company also may not be able to achieve the 2027 objectives under the Company's long-term strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s strategy to grow ridership may not be successful. The Company has been successful in marketing its products in large part by promoting the experience of Harley-Davidson motorcycling. To sustain and grow the business over the long-term, the Company must grow the sport of motorcycling and continue to be successful selling products and promoting the experience of motorcycling to new customers, including new riders, competitive riders and those who have motorcycle licenses but do not currently ride. The Company\u2019s efforts toward expanding to 4 million total Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S. through 2027 and growing ridership internationally may not be successful, and achieving such growth in ridership may still not adequately meet the desired result of driving unit sales growth. Further, growing ridership in the U.S. may be challenging because the motorcycle market in the U.S. has been stagnant or declining, and the Company expects those conditions to continue. Failure to successfully drive demand for the Company's products may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new, innovative and compliant products. The motorcycle market continues to change in terms of styling preferences and advances in new technologies, and at the same time, it is subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions. The Company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors\u2019 products with unique styling and new technologies that consumers desire. The Company may not be able to achieve its goal of introducing 100 new, high-impact motorcycle models between 2017 and 2027, and introducing those models may still not lead to the desired result of driving unit sales growth. As the Company incorporates new and different features and technology into its products, the Company must protect its intellectual property from imitators and ensure its products do not infringe the intellectual property of other companies. In addition, these new products must comply with applicable regulations worldwide and satisfy the potential demand for products that produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy. The Company must make product advancements to respond to changing consumer preferences and market demands. The Company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to a global marketplace in an efficient and timely manner and at prices that are attractive to customers. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the Company\u2019s new products.\n\u2022\nChanges in general economic and business conditions, tightening of credit and retail markets, political events or other factors may adversely impact independent dealers\u2019 retail sales. The motorcycle industry is impacted by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control. These factors can weaken the retail environment and lead to weaker demand for discretionary purchases such as motorcycles. Weakened economic conditions in certain business sectors and geographic areas can also result in reduced demand for the Company's products. Tightening of credit can limit the availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which could adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the purchase of\nmotorcycles from lenders, including HDFS. Should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand decline, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be substantially adversely affected. The motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control.\n\u2022\nIncreased supply of and/or declining prices for used motorcycles and excess supply of new motorcycles may adversely impact retail sales of new motorcycles by the Company\u2019s independent dealers. The Company has observed that when the supply of used motorcycles increases or the prices for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles decline, there can be reduced demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Further, the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. For example, introduction of new motorcycle models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of used motorcycles, which could result in declining prices for used motorcycles and prior model-year new motorcycles. Also, while the Company has taken steps designed to balance production volumes for its new motorcycles with demand, those steps may not be effective, or the Company\u2019s competitors could choose to supply new motorcycles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which could also have the effect of reducing demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Ultimately, reduced demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles leads to reduced shipments by the Company.\n\u2022\nThe financial services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale finance receivables. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer, including the Company's independent dealers, to meet the terms of any contract with the Company\u2019s financial services operations. Credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions, including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings and other factors that negatively affect household incomes, as well as contract terms and customer credit profiles. Credit losses are also influenced by the markets for new and used motorcycles, and the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that impact those markets. For example, the introduction of new models by the Company that represent significant upgrades on previous models may result in increased supply or decreased demand in the market for used Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles, including those motorcycles that serve as collateral or security for credit that HDFS has extended. This in turn could adversely impact the prices at which repossessed motorcycles may be sold, which may lead to increased credit losses for HDFS. Negative changes in general business, economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial services credit losses and future earnings. The Company believes HDFS' retail credit losses may continue to increase over time due to changing consumer credit behavior, HDFS' efforts to increase prudently structured loan approvals to sub-prime borrowers, and new financing programs that may result in different loan performance than our existing programs.\n\u2022\nThe motorcycle industry has become increasingly competitive. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors are more diversified than the Company, and they may compete in all segments of the motorcycle market, other powersports markets and/or the automotive market. Also, the Company\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors, and as price becomes a more important factor for consumers in the markets in which the Company competes, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, many competitors headquartered outside the U.S. experience a financial benefit from a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to their home currency that can enable them to reduce prices to U.S. consumers. In addition, the Company\u2019s financial services operations face competition from various banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms, particularly for borrowers in higher credit tiers. The Company's responses to these competitive pressures, or its failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nExpanding international sales and operations subjects the Company to risks that may have a material adverse effect on its business. Expanding international sales and operations is a part of the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy, particularly in light of the U.S. market conditions. There is no assurance that the Company will accomplish this international expansion. Further, to support that strategy, the Company must increase its presence outside the U.S., including additional employees and investment in business infrastructure and operations. International operations and sales are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations, the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices. The Company may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net sales, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the impact of United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (EU)\n(commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Business practices that may be accepted in other countries can violate U.S. or other laws that apply to the Company. Violations of laws that apply to the Company's foreign operations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company's business and result in an adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, their enforcement and downstream consequences, may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and outlook. Tariffs and/or other developments with respect to trade policies, trade agreements and government regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent tariffs imposed by the EU and China resulted in material increases to the Company\u2019s operating costs in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, the EU placed a 25% incremental tariff (31% total tariff) on motorcycles imported into the EU from the U.S., which is scheduled to increase to a 50% incremental tariff (56% total tariff) effective June 1, 2021. In addition, the U.S. government has imposed increased tariffs on imports from China (Section 301 tariffs), which has resulted in higher costs for components and products sourced from China.\nIn 2019, the Company obtained regulatory approvals that allow it to supply its EU markets with Touring, Softail\u00ae and Sportster\u00ae motorcycles produced at its Thailand operations at reduced tariff rates of 6%. These motorcycles will not be subject to the current 31% or future 56% tariffs that apply to motorcycles sourced from the Company's U.S. facilities. The Company expects wholesale shipments of Thailand-sourced lower-tariff motorcycles in the EU to begin early in the second quarter of 2020(1). Certain Trike and CVO\u2122 models will continue to be sourced from the U.S. and will remain subject to the higher EU tariffs.\nRecent U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain largely unmitigated and are expected to cost the Company approximately $15 million in 2020(1). The on-going impact of these tariffs will depend on future trade discussions between the U.S. and China or the Company\u2019s ability to avoid or offset these costs should the tariffs remain in place.\nWithout limitation, (i) tariffs currently in place, (ii) the imposition by the U.S. government of new tariffs on imports to the U.S. and/or (iii) the imposition by foreign countries of tariffs on U.S. products, including tariffs imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, could materially increase: (a) the cost of Harley-Davidson products that the Company is offering for sale in relevant countries, (b) the cost of certain products that the Company sources from foreign manufacturers and (c) the prices of certain raw materials that the Company utilizes. The Company may not be able to pass such increased costs on to independent dealers or their customers, and the Company may not be able to secure sources of certain products and materials that are not subject to tariffs on a timely basis. Such developments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company may not be able to successfully execute its manufacturing strategy. The Company\u2019s manufacturing strategy is designed to continuously improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. Based on the Company\u2019s strategy, the Company may, from time to time, open, close, expand, contract or restructure one or more of its manufacturing facilities. The Company believes flexible manufacturing, including flexible supply chains and flexible labor agreements, is a key element to enable improvements in the Company\u2019s ability to respond to customers in a cost effective manner(1). To execute this strategy, the Company must be successful in its implementation of facility changes and in its continuous improvement efforts, all of which are dependent on the involvement of management, production employees and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s products and its ability to deliver the right product at the right time to the customer.\n\u2022\nThe Company must prevent and detect issues with its products, components purchased from suppliers and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes to reduce recall campaigns, warranty costs, litigation, product liability claims, delays in new model launches and regulatory investigations. The Company must also complete any recall campaigns within cost expectations. The Company must continually improve and adhere to product development and manufacturing processes and ensure that its suppliers and their sub-tier suppliers adhere to product development and manufacturing processes, to ensure high quality products are sold to retail customers. If product designs or manufacturing processes are defective, the Company could experience delays in new model launches, field actions such as product programs and product recalls, inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies, and warranty claims and product liability claims, which may involve purported class actions. While the Company uses reasonable methods to estimate the cost of warranty, recall and product liabilities and appropriately reflects those in its financial statements, there is a risk the actual costs could exceed estimates and result in damages that are not covered by insurance. Further, selling products with poor quality, the announcement of recalls and the filing of product liability claims (whether or not successful), may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and brand strength.\n\u2022\nA cybersecurity breach may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, revenue and earnings. The Company and certain of its third-party service providers and vendors receive, store and transmit digital personal information in connection with the Company\u2019s human resources operations, financial services operations, e-commerce, the Harley Owners Group, dealer management, mobile applications, planned connected vehicle services offerings and other aspects of its business. The Company\u2019s information systems, and those of its third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to continually evolving cybersecurity risks. The Company's plan to offer connected vehicle services will heighten these risks. Unauthorized parties have attempted to and may attempt in the future to gain access to these systems or the information the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors maintain and use through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees and third-party service providers and vendors. Hardware, software or applications the Company develops or obtains from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security and/or the Company\u2019s operations. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. The Company has experienced information security attacks, but to date they have not materially compromised the Company\u2019s computing environment or resulted in a material impact on the Company\u2019s business or operations or the release of confidential information about employees, customers, dealers, suppliers or other third parties. Any future significant compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, employee, dealer, supplier or Company data could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and evolving requirements, compliance could also result in the Company being required to incur additional costs.\n\u2022\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign country\u2019s local currency. As a result, a weakening in those foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can adversely affect the Company's revenue margin, and cause volatility in results of operations. Furthermore, many competitors headquartered outside the U.S. experience a financial benefit from a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to their home currency that can enable them to reduce prices to U.S. consumers. The Company is also subject to risks associated with changes in prices of commodities. Earnings from the Company\u2019s financial services business are affected by changes in interest rates. Although the Company uses derivative financial instruments to some extent to attempt to manage a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rate risks, the Company does not attempt to manage its entire expected exposure, and these derivative financial instruments generally do not extend beyond one year and may expose the Company to credit risk in the event of counterparty default to the derivative financial instruments. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will successfully manage these risks.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. The Company believes that the Harley-Davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base. Failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the Harley-Davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on third-party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles. The Company may experience supply problems relating to raw materials and components such as unfavorable pricing, poor quality or untimely delivery. In certain circumstances, the Company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part, and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the Company\u2019s production schedule. In addition, the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the Company\u2019s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material, natural disasters or widespread infectious disease. Further, the Company's suppliers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs because of tightening credit caused by financial market disruption. In addition, adverse economic conditions and related pressure on select suppliers due to difficulties in the global manufacturing arena could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company. Changes in laws and policies relating to trade and taxation may also adversely impact the Company's foreign suppliers. These supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees, including skilled labor, executive officers and other senior leaders. The Company\u2019s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of its organization and to effectively execute reorganization actions within expected costs and realize the expected benefits of those actions. The Company\u2019s current and future total compensation arrangements, which include benefits and incentive awards, may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating the Company\u2019s existing employees. In addition, the Company must cultivate and sustain a work environment where employees are engaged and energized in their jobs to maximize their performance, and the Company must effectively execute reorganization actions. If the Company does not succeed in attracting new personnel, retaining existing personnel, implementing effective succession plans and motivating and engaging personnel, including executive officers, the Company may be unable to develop and distribute products and services and effectively execute its plans and strategies.\n\u2022\nThe Company primarily sells its products at wholesale and must rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the retail distribution of its products. The Company depends on the capability of its independent dealers to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers purchase from the Company. If the Company\u2019s independent dealers are not successful in these endeavors, then the Company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations. Further, independent dealers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations resulting from adverse business conditions, such as weakened retail sales and tightened credit. If independent dealers are unsuccessful, they may exit or be forced to exit the business or, in some cases, the Company may seek to terminate relationships with certain independent dealerships. As a result, the Company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of independent dealer relationships. Additionally, liquidating a former independent dealer\u2019s inventory of new and used motorcycles can add downward pressure on new and used motorcycle prices. Further, the unplanned loss of any of the Company\u2019s independent dealers may lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of new motorcycles and for servicing previously sold motorcycles, create negative impressions of the Company with its retail customers, and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to collect wholesale receivables that are associated with that independent dealer.\n\u2022\nThe financial services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund operations at competitive interest rates, the Company\u2019s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings, and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations. Liquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s financial services business. Disruptions in financial markets may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease to loan money to borrowers, including financial institutions. The Company\u2019s financial services operations may be negatively affected by difficulty in raising capital in the long-term and short-term capital markets. These negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital and reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers. Additionally, the ability of the Company and its financial services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short-term and long-term credit ratings. If the Company\u2019s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings outlook is negatively changed, then the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing could increase, which may result in reduced earnings and reduced interest margins, and the Company\u2019s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired.\n\u2022\nThe Company must invest in and successfully implement new information systems and technology. The Company is continually modifying and enhancing its systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency and to mitigate failure risks from older/aged technologies currently in its portfolio. The Company has several large, strategic information system projects in process. As new systems and technologies (and related strategies) are implemented, the Company could experience unanticipated difficulties resulting in unexpected costs and adverse impacts to its manufacturing and other business processes. When implemented, the systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to ongoing operations. Also, older technologies may fail, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In the case of the Company's planned electronic vehicle services offering, these risks are heightened because these services are dependent on (i) the successful implementation of complex third-party cloud solutions, (ii) the ability of a rider's motorcycle and mobile application to successfully connect to each other and (iii) the support of cellular carriers.\n\u2022\nThe Company must comply with governmental laws and regulations that are subject to change and involve significant costs. The Company\u2019s sales and operations in areas outside the U.S. may be subject to foreign laws, regulations and the legal systems of foreign courts or tribunals. These laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies may result in increased costs or restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell its products in certain countries. U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect the Company's international sales operations.\nThe Company\u2019s domestic sales and operations are subject to governmental policies and regulatory actions of agencies of the United States Government, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Labor and Federal Trade Commission. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales and operations are also subject to laws and actions of state legislatures and other local regulators, including independent dealer statutes and licensing laws. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations\nTax - The Company is subject to income and non-income based taxes in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide income tax liabilities and other tax liabilities including the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). The Company believes that it complies with applicable tax laws. If the governing tax authorities have a different interpretation of the applicable laws or if there is a change in tax laws, the Company's financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely affected. To the extent there are considerable changes to tax laws, the Company may need to readjust its tax strategy, and may not be able to take full advantage of such changes.\nEnvironmental - The majority of the Company\u2019s motorcycle products use internal combustion engines. These motorcycle products are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board and regulatory agencies in certain foreign countries where the Company\u2019s motorcycle products are sold. The Company is also subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise in the conduct of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations. Any significant change to the regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise may substantially increase the cost of manufacturing the Company\u2019s products. If the Company fails to meet existing or new requirements, then the Company may be unable to sell certain products or may be subject to fines or penalties. Further, in response to concerns about global climate changes and related changes in consumer preferences, the Company may face greater regulatory or customer pressure to develop products that generate less emissions. This may require the Company to spend additional funds on research, product development and implementation costs and subject the Company to the risk that the Company\u2019s competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage.\nFinancial Services - The Company\u2019s financial services operations are governed by a wide range of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws that regulate financial and lending institutions, and financial services activities. In the U.S. for example, these laws include the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. The financial services operations originate the majority of its consumer loans through its subsidiary, Eaglemark Savings Bank, a Nevada state thrift chartered as an Industrial Loan Company. U.S. federal and state bodies may in the future impose additional laws, regulation and supervision over the financial services industry.\nViolations of, or non-compliance with, relevant laws and regulations may limit the ability of HDFS to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans, may entitle the borrower to rescind the loan or obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, could subject HDFS to payment of damages, civil fines, or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions and could limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitizations programs. Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision also could limit the discretion of HDFS in operating its business, such as through the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of administrative sanctions, including \"cease and desist\" orders. The Company cannot assure that the applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed in ways that are adverse to HDFS, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted in the future, or that laws and regulations will not attempt to limit the interest rates or convenience fees charged by HDFS, any of which may adversely affect the business of HDFS or its results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) is a sweeping piece of legislation impacting financial services and the full effect continues to evolve as regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted, and the text of the Dodd-Frank Act is analyzed by stakeholders and the courts. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau). The Bureau has significant enforcement and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that the Bureau will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are all elements that are not yet fully known and subject to change. Compliance may be costly and could affect operating results as the implementation of new forms, processes, procedures and controls and infrastructure may be required. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Failure to comply, as well as changes to laws and regulations, or the imposition of additional laws and regulations, could affect HDFS\u2019 earnings, limit its access to capital, limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitization programs and have a material adverse effect on HDFS\u2019 business and results of operations. The Bureau also has supervisory authority over certain\nnon-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market, which includes a non-bank subsidiary of HDFS, allowing the Bureau to conduct comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations that could result in enforcement actions, fines, changes to processes and procedures, product-related changes or consumer refunds, or other actions.\nU.S. Public Company - The Company is also subject to policies and actions of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Many major competitors of the Company are not subject to the requirements of the SEC or the NYSE rules. As a result, the Company may be required to disclose certain information that may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its principal competitors.\n\u2022\nWeather may impact retail sales by the Company's independent dealers. The Company has observed that abnormally cold and/or wet conditions in a region, including impacts from hurricanes or unusual storms, could have the effect of reducing demand or changing the timing for purchases of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Reduced demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles ultimately leads to reduced shipments by the Company.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor. A substantial portion of the hourly production employees working in the Motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. HDMC is currently a party to three collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Steelworkers of America. Current collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in Wisconsin will expire in 2024, and the agreement with employees in Pennsylvania will expire in 2022. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms that will allow the Company to be competitive. The Company's decisions regarding opening, closing, expanding, contracting or restructuring its facilities may require changes to existing or new bargaining agreements. Failure to renew agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the Company and the unions could result in the relocation of production facilities, work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Company to expand international sales may be impacted by existing or new laws and regulations that impose motorcycle licensing restrictions and limit access to roads and highways. Expanding international sales is a part of the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy. A number of countries have tiered motorcycle licensing requirements that limit the ability of new and younger riders to obtain licenses to operate the Company\u2019s motorcycles, and many countries are considering the implementation of such requirements. These requirements only allow new and/or younger riders to operate smaller displacement motorcycles for certain periods of time. Riders typically are only permitted to obtain a license to ride larger displacement motorcycles upon reaching certain ages and/or having been licensed to ride smaller displacement motorcycles for a certain period of time, and only after passing additional tests and paying additional fees. These requirements pose obstacles to large displacement motorcycle ownership. Other countries have laws and regulations that prohibit motorcycles from being operated on certain roads and highways. These types of laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s plans to expand international sales.\n\u2022\nThe Company is and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, reputation and brand. The defense of the lawsuits may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations. In addition, although the Company is unable to determine the amount, if any, that it may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, any such payment may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K and in the other periodic reports that the Company files with the SEC for additional detail regarding lawsuits and other claims against the Company.\n\u2022\nThe Company, its suppliers and its independent dealers must successfully accommodate a seasonal retail motorcycle sales pattern. The Company records the wholesale sale of a motorcycle when it is shipped to the Company\u2019s independent dealers. The Company's flexible production capability allows it to more closely correlate motorcycle production and wholesale shipments with the retail selling season. Any difficulties in executing flexible production could result in lost production or sales. The Company, its suppliers and its independent dealers must be able to successfully manage changes in production rates, inventory levels and other business processes associated with flexible production. Failure by the Company, its suppliers or its independent dealers to make such adjustments may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits. The Company\u2019s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and healthcare benefits for both active and retired employees are based on several factors that are outside the Company\u2019s control. These factors include funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the rate used to discount the future estimated liabilities, the rate of return on plan assets, current and projected healthcare costs, healthcare reform or legislation, retirement age and mortality. Changes in these factors can impact the expense, liabilities and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, liquidity or shareholders\u2019 equity. In addition, costs associated with these benefits put the Company under significant cost pressure as compared to its competitors that may not bear the costs of similar benefit plans. Furthermore, costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may produce additional cost pressure on the Company and its health care plans.\n\u2022\nThe Company must maintain stakeholder confidence in its corporate governance practices and operating ethics. The Company believes it has a history of good corporate governance and operating ethics. The Company has a Code of Business Conduct that defines how employees interact with various Company stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing. Failure to maintain its reputation for good corporate governance and strong operating ethics may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress has previously considered and may in the future implement restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, several U.S. states, including states where the Company has manufacturing facilities, have previously considered and may in the future implement greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Energy security and availability and its related costs affect all aspects of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations in the U.S., including the Company\u2019s supply chain. The Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of the Company\u2019s facilities emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity the Company purchases, increase costs for use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require the Company to purchase allowances to offset the Company\u2019s own emissions or result in an overall increase in costs of raw materials, any one of which could increase the Company\u2019s costs, reduce competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operations or financial results. Many of the Company\u2019s suppliers face similar circumstances. Physical risks to the Company\u2019s business operations as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other expert bodies include scenarios such as sea level rise, extreme weather conditions and resource shortages. Extreme weather may disrupt the production and supply of component parts or other items such as natural gas, a fuel necessary for the manufacture of motorcycles and their components. Supply disruptions would raise market rates and jeopardize the continuity of motorcycle production.\n\u2022\nRegulations related to materials that the Company purchases to use in its products could cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences. Laws or regulations impacting the Company's supply chain, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act, could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the raw materials that the Company uses in the manufacturing of its products. The Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to fully understand its supply chain, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others and other adverse consequences. For example, many countries in which the Company distributes its products are beginning to introduce regulations that require knowledge and disclosure of virtually all materials and chemicals in the Company\u2019s products. Accordingly, the Company could incur significant costs related to the process of complying with these laws, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company. Similar to suppliers of raw materials and components, the Company may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these suppliers may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting the Company's operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that the Company has outsourced, these service provider risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company disclaims any obligation to update these risk factors or any other forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation, and specifically disclaims any such obligation, to update these risk factors or any other\nforward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 70033, "SIC": 3751, "TIC": "HOG"}
