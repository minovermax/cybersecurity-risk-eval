RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nThe Federal Reimbursement Rate for Gamma Knife Treatments Has Fluctuated\nCongress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Prior to April 1, 2013, Medicare\u2019s reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment had been relatively stable. In April 2013, the Medicare reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment was lowered from approximately $9,900 to $5,300 per treatment session. This sudden reduction in a rate that had historically been stable resulted in a significant decrease in the Company\u2019s revenues from all of our revenue sharing and some of our fixed fee medical centers. The reimbursement rate was subsequently increased to approximately $5,600 in 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, CMS established a comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) for both Gamma Knife and LINAC one session cranial radiosurgery at a reimbursement rate of approximately $9,700. This represents an estimated increase of $4,100 per Medicare Gamma Knife treatment (exclusive of co-insurance and other adjustments) effective January 1, 2015 compared to the 2014 Medicare reimbursement rate. The 2016 reimbursement level was reduced by CMS to approximately $8,800. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and financial results.\nThe average Medicare reimbursement rate trends from 2012 to 2016 are outlined below:\nAverage Medicare Reimbursement Rate Trends\nThe Company\u2019s Capital Investment at Each Site is Substantial\nEach radiosurgical or radiation therapy device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment.\nThe Market for the Gamma Knife is Limited\nThere is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun operation at only four (4) new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 130 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which 17 units were owned by the Company. The Company has two idle Gamma Knife units with a cumulative net book value of $1,500,000. The Company plans to trade these units in for new units or place these units at new sites. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing these idle units or additional units at any sites in the future. The Company\u2019s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.\nThe Company Has a High Level of Debt\nThe Company\u2019s business is capital intensive. The Company finances its Gamma Knife units through its GKF subsidiary. The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourse to ASHS. The Company\u2019s combined long term debt and capital leases totaled $23,118,000 as of December 31, 2015 and is collateralized by the Gamma Knife and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of the financed equipment. This high level of debt may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If default on debt occurs in the future, the Company\u2019s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife unit or other equipment with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.\nA Small Number of Customers Account for a Major Portion of our Revenues\nA limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2015, six (6) customers in total accounted for more than 50% of the Company\u2019s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company\u2019s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Market for the Company\u2019s Services is Competitive\nThe Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe there are no competitor companies that currently have more than three (3) Gamma Knife units in operation. The Company\u2019s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to such customers and may also lose future sales to its competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units.\nThere are Alternatives to the Gamma Knife\nOther radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition, neurosurgeons who are primarily responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company has plans to install, in 2016, a Gamma Knife in Peru. The Company sold its operations in Turkey on June 10, 2014. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company\u2019s inability to operate in those locations.\nNew Technology and Products Could Result in Equipment Obsolescence\nThere is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgraded Gamma Knife which cost approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic Positioning System\u2122 (\u201cAPS\u201d), and therefore involved less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduced a new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Model 4C (\u201cModel 4C\u201d). The cost to upgrade existing units to the Model 4C with APS was approximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which costs approximately $4.5 million plus applicable taxes and duties. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon TM. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment of larger tumors. Existing models of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2016, 14 of the Company\u2019s Gamma Knife units are Perfexion models; of the Company\u2019s remaining Gamma Knife units, five (5) are Model 4C with APS and one is upgradeable to a more advanced Model 4C unit. The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, there are constant advances made in radiation therapy equipment. The Company purchased IGRT and CT Simulator systems in 2006 with a list price of approximately $8,300,000. As in the Gamma Knife business, new and improved IGRT equipment can be introduced that could make the existing technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate.\nThe Company Has Invested in a Proton Beam Business that is Developmental\nWe have committed a substantial amount of our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December 2013. We have committed to purchase three (3) MEVION S250 systems, and have already made deposits of $5,000,000 towards this commitment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance these machines and if we do, that we will recover this investment or future investments, or our $2,709,000 common stock investment in Mevion, which was written down to approximately $579,000 as of December 31, 2015. As of January 2016, we have finalized financing for the Company\u2019s first MEVION S250 that is starting at UF Health Cancer Center at Orlando Health in the second quarter 2016.\nThe Trading Volume of Our Common Stock is Low\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, our common stock has experienced low trading volume, both historically and recently. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 3,200 shares. There is no reason to think that a more active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive to you.", "PERMNO": 13769, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "AMS"}
