{"cik": "1517022", "company": "Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks and uncertainties in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also become important factors that affect our business. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position, Need for Additional Capital and Growth Strategy\nOur business is substantially dependent on the commercial success of Auryxia\u00ae (ferric citrate) and the regulatory approval and commercial success of vadadustat. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for vadadustat in the United States on a timely basis, or at all, or if we are unable to successfully commercialize current and future indications of Auryxia or vadadustat on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial condition and future profitability will be materially harmed.\nOur business and our ability to generate product revenue depend almost entirely on our, and our collaborators\u2019, ability to successfully commercialize Auryxia, obtain regulatory approval of vadadustat by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and successfully commercialize vadadustat, if approved, and the level of market adoption for, and the continued use of, our products and product candidates, if approved. If we are not successful in obtaining regulatory approval for vadadustat, or commercializing any approved product, including achieving and maintaining an adequate level of market adoption, our profitability and our future business prospects will be adversely impacted.\nVadadustat is an investigational drug and is not approved by the FDA or any regulatory authority with the exception of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients in March 2021 and the FDA assigned the application standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of March 29, 2022. There is no guarantee that vadadustat will receive regulatory approval from the FDA by the PDUFA date, whether vadadustat will be approved at all and, if approved, whether the scope of approval will include the treatment of anemia due to CKD in both DD-CKD and NDD-CKD adult patients. We will not be able to market or commercialize vadadustat in the United States unless and until it is approved. In the event that vadadustat does not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, or at all, our financial condition would be materially harmed.\nIn addition, the success of Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any current or future product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, and our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability, depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the timing and scope of marketing approvals for vadadustat and any other product candidate, if approved, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022maintaining marketing approvals for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022obtaining adequate or favorable pricing and reimbursement from private and governmental payors for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining market acceptance of Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022the size of any market in which Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, receives approval and obtaining adequate market share in those markets;\n\u2022actual or perceived advantages or disadvantages of our products or product candidates as compared to alternative treatments, including their respective safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles, the potential convenience and ease of administration and cost;\n\u2022maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of our approved products, including the frequency and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies, based, in part, on their perception of our clinical trial data and/or the actual or perceived safety, tolerability and efficacy profile;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate supplies of products that are compliant with good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, to support the clinical development and the market demand for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product and product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022current and future restrictions or limitations on our approved or future indications and patient populations or other adverse regulatory actions or in the event that the FDA requires Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or risk management plans that use restrictive risk minimization strategies;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution strategies and operations;\n\u2022competing effectively with any products for the same or similar indications as our products;\n\u2022maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents and trade secrets; and\n\u2022the impact of the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, pandemic on the above factors, including the limitation of our sales professionals to meet in person with healthcare professionals as the result of travel restrictions or limitations on access for non-patients.\nMarket acceptance is critical to our ability to generate significant product revenue. Any product may achieve only limited market acceptance or none at all. If any of our approved products is not accepted by the market to the extent that we expect or market acceptance decreases, we may not be able to generate significant product revenue and our business would be materially harmed. Market acceptance of any approved product depends on a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by and the availability of discounts, rebates and price concessions from third party payors, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and governmental authorities;\n\u2022the safety and efficacy of the product, as demonstrated in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting;\n\u2022the prevalence and complications of the disease treated by the product;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved and the product label approved by regulatory authorities, including any warnings or limitations that may be required on the label as a consequence of potential safety risks associated with the product;\n\u2022the countries in which marketing approvals are obtained;\n\u2022the claims we and our collaborators are able to make regarding the safety and efficacy of the product;\n\u2022the success of our physician and patient communications and education programs;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment and the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe new therapies;\n\u2022the cost, safety and efficacy of the product in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the timing of receipt of marketing approvals and product launch relative to competing products and potential generic entrants;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the frequency and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022favorable or adverse publicity about our products or favorable or adverse publicity about competing products;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our and our collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and\n\u2022the restrictions on the use of the product together with other medications, if any.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses and cannot guarantee when, if ever, we will become profitable or attain positive cash flows.\nInvestment in pharmaceutical product development and commercialization is highly speculative because it requires upfront capital expenditures and there is significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain marketing approval or that an approved product will not be commercially viable. Since our inception, we have devoted most of our resources to research and development, including our preclinical and clinical development activities and, following the merger, or the Merger, whereby Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., or Keryx, became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, commercialization. We have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, our strategic collaborations and, following the Merger, product revenues, a royalty monetization transaction and debt. Prior to the Merger, we had no products approved for commercial sale and had not generated any revenue from the sale of products. We are not currently profitable and have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $282.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion. We cannot guarantee when, if ever, we will become profitable.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures, and our financial position will depend, in part, on product revenue, collaboration revenue, and our ability to obtain additional funding. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses if and as we:\n\u2022conduct and enroll patients in any clinical trials, including post-marketing studies or any other clinical trials for Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022continue our commercialization activities for Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved, and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for vadadustat and any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022maintain marketing approvals for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022have Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, manufactured for clinical trials and for commercial sale;\n\u2022conduct discovery and development activities for additional product candidates or platforms that may lead to the discovery of additional product candidates;\n\u2022engage in transactions, including strategic, merger, collaboration, acquisition and licensing transactions, pursuant to which we would market and develop commercial products, or develop and commercialize other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022make royalty, milestone or other payments under our license agreements and any future license agreements;\n\u2022maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022continue to create additional infrastructure and expend additional resources to support our operations as a fully integrated, publicly traded biopharmaceutical company; and\n\u2022experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\nWe have and will continue to expend significant resources in our legal proceedings, as described under Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, or any other legal proceedings brought by or against us in the future.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter, the progress of our clinical development and our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nEven if we succeed in receiving marketing approval for, and are able to commercialize vadadustat in the United States and other regions, we will continue to incur substantial expenditures relating to continued commercialization and post-marketing requirements for Auryxia, vadadustat and any other products, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, as well as costs relating to the research and development of any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, or other regulatory authorities, or if we otherwise believe it is necessary, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, to amend or replace our study protocols, to conduct any additional clinical trials, whether in order to obtain approval or as a post-approval study, to perform studies in addition to, different from or larger than those currently planned, if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or if there are delays in or issues with obtaining marketing approval for vadadustat in the United States, the European Union, or EU, or other jurisdictions. In addition, our ability to generate revenue would be negatively affected if the size of our addressable patient population is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we sought or the patient population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, coverage or reimbursement, or payor or treatment guidelines. Even though we generate product revenue from Auryxia and royalties from Riona and VafseoTM, in Japan and may generate revenue and royalties from the sale of any products that may be approved in the future, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, we may never generate revenue and royalties that are significant enough for us to become and remain profitable, and we will need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities were $149.8 million. We expect to continue to expend substantial amounts of cash for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize Auryxia and seek regulatory approval for and commercialize vadadustat, if approved, and develop and commercialize any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing, potentially obtaining marketing approvals and marketing products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of our current and anticipated clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amount of funding necessary to successfully complete clinical development for any current or future product candidates, including vadadustat if additional clinical trials are required in order to obtain marketing approval, or to complete post-marketing studies for Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of conducting clinical trials or any post-marketing requirements or any other clinical trials for Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022the cost and timing of commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution costs, for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022the results of our meetings with the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and any consequential effects, including on timing of and ability to obtain and maintain marketing approval, study design, study size and resulting operating costs;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the outcome of our efforts to obtain marketing approval for vadadustat in the United States, Europe and in other jurisdictions and any other product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, including any additional clinical trials or post-approval commitments imposed by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the timing of, and the costs involved in obtaining, marketing approvals for vadadustat and any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, including to fund the preparation, filing and prosecution of regulatory submissions;\n\u2022the costs of maintaining marketing approvals for Auryxia or any other product, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired;\n\u2022the cost of securing and validating commercial manufacturing for any of our product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, and maintaining our manufacturing arrangements for Auryxia and vadadustat or any other product, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, or securing and validating additional arrangements;\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including litigation costs, and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u2022the costs involved in any legal proceedings to which we are a party;\n\u2022our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022any ongoing costs related to the creation of additional infrastructure and expansion of additional resources to support our operations as a fully integrated, publicly traded biopharmaceutical company; and\n\u2022the extent to which we engage in transactions, including strategic, merger, collaboration, acquisition and licensing transactions, pursuant to which we would develop and market commercial products, or develop other product candidates and technologies.\nFurthermore, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a fully integrated, publicly traded biopharmaceutical company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our cash resources to fund our current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong due to a variety of factors, including due to the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. However, the potential timely regulatory approval of vadadustat and the receipt of associated regulatory milestones is an important source of funding of our cash runway, which are outside of our control. We expect to finance future cash needs through product revenue, public or private equity or debt transactions, payments from our collaborators (including associated regulatory approval milestones), royalty transactions, strategic transactions, or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional funding to fund our operating plan beyond the next twelve months, including to pursue development and commercial activities related to Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved, or any additional products and product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we could be required to delay our development efforts, limit activities and reduce costs, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There can be no assurance, that the current operating plan will be achieved in the time frame anticipated by us, or that its cash resources will fund our operating plan for the period anticipated by us or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management\u2019s attention away from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize Auryxia, vadadustat and any other products or product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. Also, additional funds may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other products or product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the filing of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date the financial statements are issued and certain elements of our operating plan are outside of our control, including the potential regulatory approval of vadadustat and the receipt of associated regulatory milestones, that cannot be considered probable. Therefore, the report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our losses from operations and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our assessment.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved in the time frame anticipated by us, or that our cash resources will fund our operating plan for the period anticipated by the Company or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nPursuant to covenants in the Loan Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment and Waiver, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K thereafter, must not be subject to any qualification as to going concern. If we do not satisfy the covenant as to going concern in any of these filings, we will be in default under the Loan Agreement. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Loan Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to take enforcement action, including acceleration of amounts due under the Loan Agreement, which we may not have the available cash resources to repay at such time. If we are required to repay amounts due under the Loan Agreement earlier than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product and product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nWe expect to finance our cash needs through product revenues, public or private equity or debt transactions, payments from our collaborators, royalty transactions, strategic transactions, or a combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, our fixed payment obligations may increase, any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, declare dividends, acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through royalty transactions, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our portfolio and future revenue streams, and enter into agreements that would restrict our operations and strategic flexibility. If we raise additional funds through strategic transactions with third parties, we may have to do so at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable. In connection with any such strategic transactions, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our product and product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to pursue planned development and commercialization activities and we may need to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify, acquire, in-license, discover, develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates or our decisions to prioritize the development of certain product candidates over others may not be successful, which could impair our ability to grow.\nAlthough we continue to focus a substantial amount of our efforts on the commercialization of Auryxia and seeking regulatory approval for, and potential commercialization of, vadadustat, a key element of our long-term growth strategy is to develop additional product candidates and acquire, in-license, develop and/or market additional products and product candidates.\nResearch programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, regardless of whether product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research and development programs may initially show promise, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential indications and/or product candidates;\n\u2022we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022a product candidate may be shown to have harmful side effects, a lack of efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and/or achieve market acceptance ;\n\u2022product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third party patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022the market for a product candidate may change during our program so that the continued development of that product candidate is no longer commercially reasonable;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; or\n\u2022a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third party payors, if applicable.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our research and development efforts for one or more of our programs, or we may not be able to identify, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on products, research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications, or outlicense rights to product candidates, that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nBecause our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists, and other researchers to sell or license product candidates, products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, and acquire promising product candidates and products. The process of identifying, selecting, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or an approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of a product candidate or an approved product. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third party products, businesses, and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure.\nMoreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. Any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA, the EMA, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, or other regulatory authorities, or post-approval testing or other requirements if approved. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any of our products will be manufactured profitably, achieve market acceptance or not require substantial post-marketing clinical trials.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify, acquire, in-license or develop suitable additional products or product candidates, which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential products, product candidates or other programs that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions to acquire assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in additional strategic transactions to expand and diversify our portfolio, including through the acquisition or in-license of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations, similar to the Merger and our existing collaboration and license arrangements. We may not identify suitable strategic transactions, or complete such transactions in a timely manner, on favorable terms, on a cost-effective basis, or at all. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential opportunities that are never completed or we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of such opportunities. Even if we successfully execute a strategic transaction, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction and may experience losses related to our investments in such transactions. Integration of an acquired company or assets into our existing business may not be successful and may disrupt\nongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation and integration of additional internal systems and infrastructure, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Even if we are able to achieve the long-term benefits of a strategic transaction, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity. Any of the foregoing could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, on June 4, 2021, we entered into a License Agreement, the Cyclerion Agreement, with Cyclerion Therapeutics Inc., or Cyclerion, pursuant to which Cyclerion granted us an exclusive global license under certain intellectual property rights to research, develop and commercialize praliciguat, an investigational oral soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC, stimulator. If we are unsuccessful in developing praliciguat or if any of the assumptions that we made in valuing the transaction, including the costs of development, were incorrect, we may not recognize the anticipated benefits of the transaction and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, future transactions may entail numerous operational, financial and legal risks, including:\n\u2022incurring substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022exposure to known and unknown liabilities, including contingent liabilities, possible intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, tax liabilities and commercial disputes;\n\u2022higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022difficulty in integrating operations, processes, systems and personnel of any acquired business;\n\u2022increased amortization expenses or, in the case of a write-down of the value of acquired assets, impairment losses, such as the Auryxia intangible asset impairment in the second quarter of 2020 and corresponding adjustments to the estimated useful life of the developed product rights for Auryxia;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership;\n\u2022inability to retain personnel, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners integral to an in-licensed or acquired product, product candidate or technology;\n\u2022potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges;\n\u2022entry into indications or markets in which we have no or limited development or commercial experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u2022other challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage any transaction in which we may engage, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand and diversify our portfolio may be limited.\nOur business has been and may continue to be, directly or indirectly, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and continues to affect our employees, patients, healthcare providers with whom we interact, customers, collaboration partners, contract research organizations, or CROs, our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, vendors, communities and business operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition continues to depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, any resurgences or variants of COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets where the healthcare providers with whom we interact, our partners, our CROs, our CMOs, and our other vendors operate.\nWe believe our revenue growth was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 primarily as the CKD patient populations that we serve continue to experience both high hospitalization and mortality rates due to COVID-19. While we are unable to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future revenues and revenue growth, COVID-19 continues to adversely and disproportionately impact CKD patients; therefore, we expect COVID-19 to continue to have a negative impact on our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\nThe majority of our office-based employees began working from home in March 2020 and continue to primarily work from home. While most of our office-based operations can be performed remotely, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed, which has limited valuable in person employee team interactions, and employees may become sick themselves and be unable to work. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executives and certain other key employees. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy and we may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability. For example, as of January 1, 2022, we have required all of our employees be fully vaccinated, subject to limited medical and religions exemptions in accordance with applicable laws. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the exact impact that our vaccine requirement will continue to have on us or on our workforce. The vaccine requirement has resulted, and may continue to result, in employee distraction and could result in litigation and difficulty securing future labor need. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, several healthcare facilities have previously restricted access for non-patients, including the members of our sales force. For example, DaVita, Inc., or DaVita, and Fresenius Medical Care, or Fresenius, which account for a vast majority of the dialysis population in the United States, have previously restricted access to their clinics. As a result, we continue to engage with some healthcare providers and other customers virtually, where possible. The restrictions on our customer-facing employees\u2019 in-person interactions with healthcare providers has, and could continue to, negatively impact our access to healthcare providers and, ultimately, our sales, including with respect to vadadustat, if approved. Recently, such precautionary measures have been relaxed at certain healthcare facilities and, as a result, members of our sales force have resumed in person interactions with certain customers. Nevertheless, some restrictions remain, and more restrictions may be put in place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including those involving new variants of COVID-19, which may be more contagious and more severe than prior strains of the virus. Given this uncertain environment and the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CKD patients, we are actively monitoring the demand for Auryxia and will be for vadadustat, if approved including the potential for further declines or changes in prescription trends and customer orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic or the response efforts to the pandemic, including, among others, competition for labor and resources and increases in labor, sourcing, manufacturing and shipping costs, may cause disruptions to, closures of or other impacts on our CMOs and other vendors in our supply chain on which we rely for the supply of our products and product candidates. At this time, our CMOs continue to operate at or near normal levels. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our contract manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and deliver Auryxia and vadadustat (if approved in the United States and which is currently marketed under the trade name VafseoTM by MTPC in Japan), which may result in increased costs and delays, or disruptions to the manufacturing and supply of our products. These impacts could have a negative effect on our inventory reserves, which could result in an increase in inventory write-offs due to expiry.\nThe pandemic has resulted in closures of and may continue to impact clinical trial sites on which we rely and will rely on in the future for the completion of certain clinical trials. COVID-19 pandemic precautions have caused moderate delays in enrolling new clinical trials and may cause delays in enrolling future clinical trials. Further, the pandemic has impacted and is likely to continue to impact the business of the FDA, the EMA and other government authorities, which potentially could result in delays in meetings, reviews, inspections and approvals relating to our product and product candidates. Any decision by the FDA, EMA or other governmental authorities to delay meeting with us or our collaboration partners or delay scheduling inspections in light of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on clinical trials of our product candidates or on our efforts to obtain marketing approvals for vadadustat, which could increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results, including the timing and amount of future regulatory milestones we could receive from our collaboration partners.\nIf we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including our collaboration partners, were to experience further shutdowns, delays or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to significantly impact economies and financial markets worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations, impact our ability to raise additional funds and impact the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained or mitigated, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe global impact of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. In particular, areas we are monitoring include possible COVID-related changes in our commercial revenue payor mix, overall product sales, and reserves and allowances, as well as negative trends that could potentially have a further significant impact on product demand and, ultimately, product revenue, or could cause goodwill, intangible assets, and other assets to be impaired. This uncertain pandemic environment has presented new risks to our business. While we are working to mitigate the impacts on\nour business, we are mindful that many of these risks and the impact to the larger healthcare market are outside of our control. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and the magnitude of which cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19, and the effectiveness of vaccines against virus variants.\nRisks Related to our Financial Arrangements\nOur obligations in connection with the loan agreement with Pharmakon and requirements and restrictions in the loan agreement could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operations.\nIn November 2019, we entered into a loan agreement with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors LP, or Pharmakon, pursuant to which senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, or the Term Loans, were made available to us in two tranches. The first tranche of $80.0 million closed on November 25, 2019, and the second tranche of $20.0 million closed on December 10, 2020. We entered into a First Amendment and Waiver to the Loan Agreement with Pharmakon in February 2022. See Note 11 to our audited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our obligations under the loan agreement, as amended, or the Loan Agreement.\nThe Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries, including maintaining, on an annual basis, a minimum liquidity threshold, which started in 2021, and on a quarterly basis, a minimum net sales threshold for Auryxia, which started in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains covenants that our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 and our future Annual Reports on Form 10-K, must not be subject to any qualification as to going concern. Failure to maintain compliance with these or other covenants would result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement, which could result in enforcement action, including acceleration of amounts due under the Loan Agreement. Additionally, the liabilities under the Loan Agreement will be accelerated, subject to certain exceptions, if we are required to repay to Vifor (International) Ltd., or Vifor Pharma, all or a part of the working capital facility established in connection with the Second Amended and Restated Vifor License Agreement that we entered into with Vifor Pharma, in February 2022, or the Vifor Second Amended Agreement, as a result of certain terminations of the Vifor Second Amended Agreement or otherwise.\nIn the event there is an acceleration of our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities under the Loan Agreement as a result of an event of default or otherwise, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay the liabilities or to make any accelerated payments, and Pharmakon could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing the Loan Agreement and our guarantee of the Term Loans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Loan Agreement permits voluntary prepayment at any time in whole or in part, subject to prepayment premiums and make-whole premiums prior to certain dates. Upon a change of control, mandatory prepayment provisions require us to prepay the principal amount outstanding, the applicable prepayment premium and make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, our obligations in connection with the Loan Agreement could have additional significant adverse consequences, including, among other things:\n\u2022restricting our activities, including limitations on transferring certain of our assets, engaging in certain transactions, terminating certain agreements, including the Vifor Second Amended Agreement, incurring certain additional indebtedness, creating certain liens, paying dividends or making certain other distributions and investments;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have a smaller amount of debt or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Royalty Interest Acquisition Agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P. contains various covenants and other provisions, which, if violated, could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nOn February 25, 2021, we entered into a royalty interest acquisition agreement, or the Royalty Agreement, with HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P., or HCR, pursuant to which we sold to HCR our right to the to receive royalties and sales milestones for vadadustat, collectively the Royalty Interest Payments, in each case, payable to us under our Collaboration Agreement dated December 11, 2015, or the MTPC Agreement, with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC, subject to an annual maximum \u201ccap\u201d of $13.0 million, or the Annual Cap, and an aggregate maximum \u201ccap\u201d of $150.0 million, or the Aggregate Cap. Under the Royalty Agreement, we are required to comply with various covenants, including obligations to take certain actions, such as actions with respect to the Royalty Interest Payments, the MTPC Agreement, our agreement with MTPC for the commercial supply of vadadustat drug product, and our intellectual property. In addition, the Royalty Agreement includes customary events of default upon the occurrence of enumerated events, including failure to perform certain covenants and the\noccurrence of insolvency events. In the event we violate certain covenants and other provisions, we may not receive sales milestones from HCR even if the applicable sales thresholds are met. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, HCR would have the ability to exercise all available remedies in law and equity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand sales and marketing capabilities or enter into additional agreements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any other product candidates that may be approved.\nIn order to market any approved product, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing, which will require substantial effort and significant management and financial resources. We have built a commercial infrastructure and sales force in the United States for Auryxia, our first commercial product, and while we believe that we can leverage this commercial foundation for vadadustat, if approved, if we are unable to do so successfully this would materially harm our business. Training a sales force to successfully sell and market a new commercial product is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any commercial launch of such product candidate. We may underestimate the size of the sales force required for a successful product launch and we may need to expand our sales force earlier and at a higher cost than we anticipated. If the commercial launch of vadadustat is delayed or does not occur for any reason, including if we do not receive marketing approval in the timeframe we expect, or at all, we may have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred commercialization expenses.\nWe devote significant effort, in particular, to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Competition for personnel with these skills is significant and retaining qualified personnel with experience in our industry is difficult. Further, the continuing or recurring restrictions placed on recruiting, training and retention by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate these conditions and interfere with our ability to find and retain qualified personnel. As a result, we may not be able to retain our existing employees or hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. At the same time, we may face high turnover, requiring us to expend time and resources to source, train and integrate new employees.\nThere are risks involved with maintaining our own sales and marketing capabilities, including the following:\n\u2022potential inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022potential inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians, including because of restrictions due to COVID-19;\n\u2022potential lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022costs and expenses associated with maintaining our own sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to maintain our own sales and marketing capabilities, we will not be successful in commercializing Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product candidate that may be approved.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to maintain our arrangements with third parties with respect to sales and marketing, if we are unsuccessful in entering into additional arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or we are unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us, or if such third parties are unable to carry out their obligations under such arrangements, it will be difficult to successfully commercialize our product and product candidates, including vadadustat, if approved. For example, if in connection with the Vifor Second Amended Agreement, we experience difficulties with Vifor Pharma, or if Vifor Pharma experiences difficulties with other parties to whom it expects to sell vadadustat, if approved, our ability to commercialize vadadustat will be severely hindered and our business operations will be materially harmed.\nOur, or our partners', failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any other future approved products, could have a material adverse effect on our or our collaboration partners\u2019 ability to sell such approved products profitably and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any approved products, including Auryxia and, if approved, vadadustat, depends significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Governmental authorities, third party payors, and PBMs decide which drugs they will cover, as well as establish formularies or implement other mechanisms to manage utilization of products and determine reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any of our potential future products. Even if we obtain coverage for an approved product, third party payors may not establish adequate reimbursement amounts, which may reduce the demand for our product and prompt us to have to reduce pricing for the product. If reimbursement is not available or is limited, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a governmental authority, third-party payor or PBM may depend upon a number of factors, including the determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under the health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient; and\n\u2022cost effective.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a governmental authority, PBM or a third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. In the United States, there are multiple governmental authorities, PBMs and third-party payors with varying coverage and reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products, and the timing of commencement of reimbursement by a governmental payor is dependent on the assignment of codes via the Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System, which codes are assigned on a quarterly basis. Within Medicare, for oral drugs dispensed by pharmacies and also administered in facilities, coverage and reimbursement may vary depending on the setting. CMS, local Medicare administrative contractors, Medicare Part D plans and/or PBMs operating on behalf of Medicare Part D plans, may have some responsibility for determining the medical necessity of such drugs, and therefore coverage, for different patients. Different reimbursement methodologies may apply, and CMS may have some discretion in interpreting their application in certain settings.\nAs an oral drug, Auryxia is covered by Medicare only under Part D. However, in September 2018, CMS decided that Auryxia would no longer be covered by Medicare for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, or IDA, in adult patients with NDD-CKD, or the IDA Indication, or the CMS Decision. While this decision does not impact CMS coverage of the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult patients with DD-CKD, or the Hyperphosphatemia Indication, it requires Part D plan sponsors to impose prior authorization or other steps to ensure that Auryxia is used only for the Hyperphosphatemia Indication. While we believe that the vast majority of the Medicare prescriptions written for Auryxia today are for the Hyperphosphatemia Indication and therefore will continue to be covered by Medicare with prior authorization, the CMS Decision has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on the sales and future growth of Auryxia for the Hyperphosphatemia Indication and the IDA Indication. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, we reduced our short-term and long-term Auryxia revenue forecast, primarily driven by the compounding impact of the CMS Decision. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $115.5 million to the Auryxia intangible asset associated with the developed product rights for Auryxia during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nMedicaid reimbursement of drugs varies by state. Private third-party payor reimbursement policies also vary and may or may not be consistent with Medicare reimbursement methodologies. Manufacturers of outpatient prescription drugs may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain third-party payors in order to obtain coverage of such products.\nAdditionally, we may be required to enter into contracts with third party payors and/or PBMs offering rebates or discounts on our products in order to obtain favorable formulary status and we may not be able to agree upon commercially reasonable terms with such third party payors or PBMs, or provide data sufficient to obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement for many reasons, including that we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines. In addition, third party payors, PBMs and other entities that purchase our products may impose restrictions on our ability to raise prices for our products over time without incurring additional costs. Four distributors, Fresenius Medical Care Rx, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and Amerisource Bergen Drug Corporation, in the aggregate, accounted for a significant percentage of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. If we are not able to maintain our arrangements with these key distributors on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all, or if there is any adverse change in one or more of these distributors\u2019 business practices or financial condition, it would adversely impact the market opportunity for Auryxia, our product revenues and operating results.\nFurthermore, vadadustat was approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with anemia due to CKD and is being marketed by MTPC in Japan under the trade name VafseoTM. Pricing and reimbursement strategy is a key component of MTPC\u2019s commercialization plans for Vafseo in Japan. If coverage and reimbursement terms change, MTPC may not be able to, or may decide not to, continue commercialization of Vafseo in Japan.\nAlthough we currently believe it is likely that vadadustat, if approved, will be reimbursed using the Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment, or TDAPA, followed by reimbursement via the bundled reimbursement model, if vadadustat is neither reimbursed under the TDAPA nor the bundled reimbursement model, then patients would access vadadustat through contracts we negotiate with third party payors for reimbursement of vadadustat, which would be subject to the risks and uncertainties described above. Additionally, applying for and obtaining reimbursement under the TDAPA is expected to take several months following approval, which will affect adoption, uptake and product revenue for vadadustat during that time, and if there are\nupdates to the TDAPA rule that decrease the basis for reimbursement or eligibility criteria during the transition period or if the TDAPA is eliminated, then our profitability may be adversely affected. For example, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, an independent legislative branch advisory body to Congress on issues related to the Medicare program, has recommended that TDAPA not be provided to newly approved drug products considered to fall within \u201cfunctional categories\u201d for which costs are already accounted for in the bundled reimbursement model, such as for anemia management drugs.\nFurther, if vadadustat is approved in the United States and included in the fixed reimbursement model for a bundle of dialysis services, or the bundle, we would be required to enter into contracts to supply vadadustat to specific dialysis providers, instead of through distributors, which we believe could be challenging. The dialysis market is unique and is dominated by two providers: DaVita and Fresenius, which account for a vast majority of the dialysis population in the United States. Under the Vifor Second Amended Agreement, we granted Vifor Pharma an exclusive license to sell vadadustat to Fresenius Medical Care North America and its affiliates, including Fresenius Kidney Care Group LLC, to certain third-party dialysis organizations approved by us, to independent dialysis organizations that are members of group purchase organizations, and to certain non-retail specialty pharmacies in the United States, or the Territory. We refer to Fresenius Medical Care North America and its affiliates, these organizations and specialty pharmacies collectively as the \u201cSupply Group\". See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Vifor Second Amended Agreement. If vadadustat is approved and we are not able to maintain the Vifor Second Amended Agreement or enter into a supply agreement with DaVita or other dialysis clinics, our business may be materially harmed.\nSimilar to how payor coverage may affect the sales of a product, formulary status within dialysis organizations may affect what products are prescribed within that specific organization. Therefore, if a product is not on a formulary, the prescribers within that organization may be less likely to prescribe that product or may have a difficult time prescribing that product, resulting in less sales. Further, one dialysis organization\u2019s determination to add a product to their formulary does not assure that other dialysis organizations will also add the product to theirs. There is always a risk a dialysis organization will not contract with a drug manufacturer for a specific product, resulting in that product not being on that organization\u2019s formulary. If any dialysis organization does not add vadadustat, if approved, to the formulary, our business may be materially harmed.\nIn addition, we may be unable to sell Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved, to dialysis providers on a profitable basis if CMS significantly reduces the level of reimbursement for dialysis services and providers choose to use alternative therapies or look to re-negotiate their contracts with us. Our profitability may also be affected if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels. Adequate coverage and reimbursement of our products by government and private insurance plans are central to patient and provider acceptance of any products for which we receive marketing approval.\nFurther, in many countries outside the United States, a drug must be approved for reimbursement before it can be marketed or sold in that country. In some cases, the prices that we intend to charge for our products are also subject to approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by reimbursement authorities outside the United States, and approval by one reimbursement authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by any other reimbursement authorities. However, the failure to obtain reimbursement in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain reimbursement in another jurisdiction. We may not be able to obtain such reimbursement approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and favorable pricing in certain countries depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully than, we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the development and commercialization of Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. Our objective is to continue to commercialize Auryxia and develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety. In many cases, any approved products that we commercialize will compete with existing, market-leading products.\nAuryxia is competing in the hyperphosphatemia market in the United States with other FDA-approved phosphate binders such as Renagel\u00ae (sevelamer hydrochloride) and Renvela\u00ae (sevelamer carbonate), both marketed by Sanofi, PhosLo\u00ae and Phoslyra\u00ae (calcium acetate), marketed by Fresenius Medical Care North America, Fosrenol\u00ae (lanthanum carbonate), marketed by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc, and Velphoro\u00ae (sucroferric oxyhydroxide), marketed by Fresenius Medical Care North America, as well as over-the-counter calcium carbonate products such as TUMS\u00ae and metal-based options such as aluminum, lanthanum and magnesium. Most of the phosphate binders listed above are now also available in generic forms. In addition, other agents are in development, including OPKO Health Inc.\u2019s Alpharen\u2122 Tablets (fermagate tablets) or could otherwise enter the market, including Ardelyx, Inc.\u2019s tenapanor (which is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with irritable\nbowel syndrome with constipation, but for which the FDA issued a complete response letter for with respect to the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with CKD on dialysis), that may impact the market for Auryxia.\nAuryxia is competing in the IDA market in the United States with over-the-counter oral iron, ferrous sulfate, other prescription oral iron formulations, including ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumerate, and polysaccharide iron complex, and intravenous iron formulations, including Feraheme\u00ae (ferumoxytol injection), Venofer\u00ae (iron sucrose injection), Ferrlicit\u00ae (sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection), Injectafer\u00ae (ferric carboxymaltose injection), and Triferic\u00ae (ferric pyrophosphate citrate). In addition, other new therapies for the treatment of IDA may impact the market for Auryxia, such as Shield Therapeutics' plc's Feraccru\u00ae (ferric maltol), which is available in Europe for the treatment of IDA and Accrufer\u00ae (ferric maltol), which was launched in the United States for the treatment of IDA in July 2021.\nFurthermore, Auryxia\u2019s commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or offer greater patient convenience than Auryxia. Other companies have product candidates in various stages of preclinical or clinical development to treat diseases and complications of the diseases for which we are marketing Auryxia. In addition, we entered into settlement agreements with each of our ANDA filers pursuant to which we granted licenses to market a generic version of Auryxia in the United States beginning in March 2025 (subject to FDA approval), or earlier under certain circumstances customary for settlement agreements of this nature, which may impact our business and results of operation.\nDrugs that may compete with vadadustat include Epogen\u00ae (epoetin alfa) and Aranesp\u00ae (darbepoetin alfa), both commercialized by Amgen, Procrit\u00ae (epoetin alfa) and Eprex\u00ae (epoetin alfa), commercialized by Johnson & Johnson in the United States and Europe, respectively, and Mircera\u00ae (methoxy PEG-epoetin beta), commercialized by Vifor Pharma in the United States and Roche Holding Ltd. outside of the United States.\nWe and our partners may also face competition from potential new anemia therapies. There are several other HIF-PH inhibitor product candidates in various stages of development for anemia indications that may be in direct competition with vadadustat if and when they are approved and launched commercially. These candidates are being developed by companies such as FibroGen Inc., or FibroGen, together with its collaboration partners, Astellas Pharma Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC, Japan Tobacco International, or JT, GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, and Bayer HealthCare AG, or Bayer.\nFurthermore, certain companies are developing potential new therapies for renal-related diseases that could potentially reduce injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, utilization and thus limit the market potential for vadadustat if they are approved and launched commercially. Other new therapies are in development for the treatment of conditions inclusive of renal anemia that may impact the market for anemia-targeted treatment.\nIn addition, in the United States, FibroGen filed an NDA for its product candidate, roxadustat, with the FDA, but the FDA issued a complete response letter indicating the FDA will not approve the NDA in its present form and requested that an additional clinical trial for roxadustat be conducted prior to resubmission of the NDA or additional response to the FDA's complete response letter. In Europe however, roxadustat is approved for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD.\nIn Japan, Vafseo, which is approved for both the DD and NDD indications, competes with roxadustat, daprodustat and enarodustat. Roxadustat is approved for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in patients on dialysis, or DD-CKD, and patients not on dialysis, or NDD-CKD. In addition, daprodustat, GSK\u2019s product candidate, and enarodustat, JT\u2019s product candidate, are approved in Japan for the treatment of anemia due to CKD. In addition. Bayer HealthCare AG has submitted an NDA for its product candidate for the treatment of renal anemia in Japan. In China, roxadustat has launched for the treatment of anemia of DD-CKD and for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in NDD-CKD patients.\nA biosimilar is a biologic product that is approved based on demonstrating that it is highly similar to an existing, FDA-approved branded biologic product. The patents for the existing, branded biologic product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market without risk of being sued for patent infringement. In addition, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the existing, branded product was approved under a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The patents for epoetin alfa, an injectable ESA, expired in 2004 in the EU, and the remaining patents expired between 2012 and 2016 in the United States. Because injectable ESAs are biologic products, the introduction of biosimilars into the injectable ESA market in the United States will constitute additional competition for vadadustat if we are able to obtain approval for and commercially launch vadadustat. In the United States, Pfizer\u2019s biosimilar version of injectable ESAs, Retacrit\u00ae (epoetin alfa-epbx), was approved by the FDA in May 2018 and launched in November 2018 and several biosimilar versions of injectable ESAs are available for sale in the EU.\nMany of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining marketing approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products. Large and established\ncompanies such as Amgen and Roche, among others, compete in the market for drug products to treat kidney disease. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we are developing obsolete. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or marketing approval, or discovering, developing and commercializing competitive products, before, or more effectively than, we do. If we are not able to compete effectively against potential competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nThe commercialization of Riona and VafseoTM in Japan and our current and potential future efforts with respect to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates outside of the United States subject us to a variety of risks associated with international operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur Japanese sublicensee, JT, and its subsidiary, Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Torii, commercialize Riona, the trade name for ferric citrate hydrate in Japan, as an oral treatment for the improvement of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD, including DD-CKD and NDD-CKD, and for the treatment of adult patients with IDA in Japan. We also granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Otsuka, exclusive rights to commercialize vadadustat in Europe, China and certain other markets, subject to marketing approvals. In Japan and certain other countries in Asia, we granted MTPC exclusive rights to commercialize vadadustat, which has been approved and is being marketed by MTPC in Japan under the trade name VafseoTM. In addition, we have conducted and in the future plan to conduct clinical trials outside of the United States for Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate that may be in-licensed or acquired. As a result of these and other activities, we are or may become subject to additional risks in developing and commercializing Auryxia and vadadustat outside the United States, including, among others:\n\u2022political, regulatory, compliance and economic developments, weakness or instability that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u2022changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022changes in healthcare policies of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022trade protection measures, including import or export licensing requirements and tariffs and our compliance therewith;\n\u2022our ability to develop or manage relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies;\n\u2022diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022differing labor regulations and business practices;\n\u2022compliance with laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or similar local regulation, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and tax, employment, immigration and labor laws;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including as a result of COVID-19; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, global pandemics, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nIn addition, we receive revenues from royalty payments converted to U.S. dollars based on net sales of Riona and VafseoTM in Japanese yen. The exchange rates between the Japanese yen on the one hand, and the U.S. dollar, on the other hand, have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Our results of operations could be adversely affected over time by certain movements in exchange rates, particularly if the Japanese yen depreciates against the U.S. dollar.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As and if we continue to expand our commercialization efforts, we may encounter new risks.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and we will incur additional costs in connection with, and may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of vadadustat and any other product candidates.\nThe risk of failure in drug development is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take several years to complete, and their outcomes are inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the process. For example, we are currently conducting a clinical trial to evaluate three times per week oral dosing of vadadustat for dialysis dependent patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease. If we experience delays in the conduct of this clinical trial or the results are not positive, it could affect the market potential of vadadustat, if approved. Further, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and results of Phase 3 clinical trials for one indication may not be predictive of results of Phase 3 clinical trials for another indication. For example, while we announced positive top-line results from INNO2VATE and vadadustat achieved the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint in each of the two PRO2TECT studies, the PRO2TECT program did not meet the primary major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE, safety endpoint. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early stage development, and we may face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates, including vadadustat, will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval or on what terms\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical development or clinical trials that could delay, prevent or make more challenging our ability to receive or maintain marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates. We may be required to complete additional clinical trials for Auryxia, vadadustat and any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, in order to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals. Our preclinical studies and clinical trials may take longer to complete than currently anticipated, or may be delayed, suspended, required to be repeated, prematurely terminated or may not successfully demonstrate safety and/or efficacy needed to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for a variety of other reasons, such as:\n\u2022the costs may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate;\n\u2022enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third party contractors, such as our CROs, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, perform effectively, or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may fail to communicate effectively or provide the appropriate level of oversight of such third party contractors;\n\u2022the supply or quality of our starting materials, drug substance and drug product necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022regulators, independent data monitoring committees, or IDMCs, institutional review boards, or IRBs, safety committees, or ethics committees, may require that we suspend or terminate our clinical trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using our product candidate, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results or results that may be interpreted in a manner different than we interpret them, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials, repeat a clinical trial or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, including unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials or repeat a clinical trial and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u2022we may fail to initiate, delay of or failure to complete a clinical trial as a result of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, being placed on clinical hold by the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA, or other regulatory authorities, or for other reasons, such as failure to recruit or enroll suitable patients or patients' failure to return for post-treatment follow up;\n\u2022we may determine to change or expand a clinical trial, including after it has begun;\n\u2022clinical trial sites and investigators deviating from the clinical protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial, or failure by us or our CROs to communicate effectively or provide the appropriate level of oversight of such clinical sites and investigators;\n\u2022there may be an inability, delay, or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of clinical trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical programs;\n\u2022there may be a delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA or other regulatory authorities on a clinical trial design upon which we are able to execute;\n\u2022there may be a delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a clinical trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u2022there may be delays in reaching, or failure to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites and prospective CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to submit additional data or impose further requirements before permitting us to initiate a clinical trial or during an ongoing clinical trial;\n\u2022the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials;\n\u2022third parties with which we work may fail to comply with good practice quality guidelines and regulations, or GXP, including good laboratory practice, good clinical practice, or GCP, and current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP; or\n\u2022there may be changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nWe may be unable to successfully obtain approval of vadadustat or other product candidates, or to successfully complete clinical trials of Auryxia, vadadustat and other product candidates if the results of those trials and studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, or if there are concerns with the profile due to efficacy or safety. For example, the PRO2TECT program did not meet the primary MACE safety endpoint, and we are remaining cautious in our outlook for potential approval of vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult non-dialysis dependent patients. If any of the foregoing occurs, the following may occur:\n\u2022regulators may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, repeat clinical trials or conduct other studies beyond those that we currently contemplate;\n\u2022we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for vadadustat or other product candidates;\n\u2022we may not obtain marketing approval for vadadustat or other product candidates at all;\n\u2022we may obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022we may obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings that would reduce the potential market for any approved product or inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize any approved product;\n\u2022a REMS or FDA-imposed risk management plan that use risk minimization strategies to ensure that the benefits of certain prescription drugs outweigh their risks, may be required;\n\u2022we may be subject to additional post-marketing restrictions and/or requirements; or\n\u2022the product may be removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in closures of and may continue to impact clinical trial sites on which we rely and will rely for the completion of certain clinical trials and may delay enrollment of certain planned and ongoing clinical trials. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued guidance on March 18, 2020, and has thereafter updated it, to address and facilitate the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic. The guidance sets out a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical study report (or as a separate document) contingency measures implemented to manage the study, and any disruption of the study as a result of the pandemic.\nOur product development costs may also increase if we experience development delays or delays in receiving the requisite marketing approvals. Our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be restructured or may not be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize vadadustat or any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. This could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends, in part, on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in our clinical trials. Patients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of concerns about adverse events observed with the product candidate under study, the current standard of care, competitor products and/or other investigational agents, in each case for the same indications and/or similar patient populations. In addition, in the case of clinical trials of any product candidate, patients currently receiving\ntreatment with the current standard of care or a competitor product may be reluctant to participate in a clinical trial with an investigational drug. Furthermore, COVID-19 resulted in closures of, and may continue to impact, clinical trial sites on which we rely for the conduct of certain clinical trials and COVID-19 pandemic precautions have caused moderate delays in enrolling new clinical trials and may cause delays in enrolling other new clinical trials. Finally, competition for clinical study sites may limit our access to patients appropriate for our clinical trials. As a result, the timeline for recruiting patients and conducting studies may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our development of any product or product candidate, or termination of the clinical trial altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022design of the study protocol;\n\u2022size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022eligibility criteria for, and design of, the study in question;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of the product or product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022availability of competing therapies and clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product or product candidate being studied in relation to available therapies or other product candidates in development;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022clinical trial sites and investigators failing to perform effectively; and\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians.\nWe may not be able to initiate or complete clinical trials in a timely manner, or at all, if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which may delay approval, or result in failure to obtain approval, of our product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConducting clinical trials outside of the United States makes us subject to additional risks and complexities and we may not complete such trials successfully, in a timely manner, or at all, which could affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOur ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical study in any country outside of the United States is subject to numerous additional risks unique to conducting business in jurisdictions outside the United States, including:\n\u2022difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with qualified CROs, physicians and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022difficulty in complying with different local standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022difficulty in complying with various and complex import laws and regulations when shipping drug to certain countries; and\n\u2022the potential burden of complying with a variety of laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.\nData obtained from studies conducted in the United States may not be accepted by the EMA, the PMDA and other regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Also, certain jurisdictions require data from studies conducted in their country in order to obtain approval in that country.\nIf we or our collaboration partners have difficulty conducting our clinical trials in jurisdictions outside the United States as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAuryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that may delay or prevent marketing approval or limit their commercial potential.\nUndesirable effects caused by, or other undesirable properties of, Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, or competing commercial products or product candidates in development that utilize a common mechanism of action could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, could result in a more restrictive label or the delay, denial or withdrawal of marketing approval by the FDA or\nother regulatory authorities, and could lead to potential product liability claims. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high frequency of undesirable effects or unexpected characteristics.\nIf we or others identify undesirable effects caused by, or other undesirable properties of, Auryxia, vadadustat, or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, or if known undesirable effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if any of the foregoing are perceived to have occurred, either before or after receipt of marketing approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022our clinical trials may be put on hold;\n\u2022patient recruitment could be slowed, and enrolled patients may not want to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require warnings on the label, such as the warning on Auryxia\u2019s label regarding iron overload;\n\u2022REMS or FDA-imposed risk management plans that use restrictive risk minimization strategies may be required;\n\u2022we may decide to, or be required to, send drug warnings or safety alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals (or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may choose to issue such alerts), or we may decide to conduct a product recall or be requested to do so by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022reformulation of the product, additional non-clinical or clinical trials, restrictive changes in labeling or changes to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required;\n\u2022we may be precluded from pursuing additional development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of a product within its indicated populations, or studying the product or product candidate in additional indications and populations or in new formulations; and\n\u2022we could be investigated by the government or sued and held liable for harm caused to patients, including in class action lawsuits; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining, whether on a restricted basis or at all, marketing approval and, ultimately, market acceptance or penetration of Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. In addition, any of these events could substantially increase our costs, and could significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product and product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, and generate product revenue.\nThe patient populations treated with Auryxia and potential patient populations for vadadustat, if approved, have CKD, a serious disease that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and stroke and, in its most severe form, results in, kidney failure and the need for dialysis or kidney transplant. Many patients with CKD are elderly with comorbidities making them susceptible to significant health risks. Therefore, the likelihood of these patients having adverse events, including serious adverse events is high.\nWith respect to the global INNO2VATE Phase 3 program, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the Correction and Conversion study in vadadustat treated patients was 83.8% and 85.5% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were hypertension (16.2%/ 12.9%) and diarrhea (10.1%/ 9.7%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were lower in vadadustat treated patients at 49.7% compared to 56.5% for darbepoetin alfa treated patients. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the prevalent dialysis patient study (Conversion) in the vadadustat treated patients was 88.3%, and 89.3% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were diarrhea (13.0%/ 10.1%), pneumonia (11.0%/ 9.7%), hypertension (10.6%/ 13.8%), and hyperkalemia (9.0%/ 10.8%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were slightly lower for vadadustat treated patients at 55.0% and 58.3% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. Patients with DD-CKD experienced an increased risk of thromboembolic events compared to darbepoetin alfa with a time to first event HR of 1.20 (95% CI 0.96 - 1.50) driven by thrombosis of vascular access.\nWith respect to the global PRO2TECT Phase 3 program, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA,-untreated patients study (Correction) in the vadadustat-treated patients was 90.9%, and 91.6% in darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa-treated patients were end-stage renal disease (34.7%/ 35.2%), hypertension (17.7%/ 22.1.%), hyperkalemia (12.3.%/ 15.6%), urinary tract infection (12.9%/ 12.0%), diarrhea (13.9%/ 10.0%), peripheral oedema (12.5%/ 10.5%), fall (9.6%/ 10%) and nausea (10%/ 8.2%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were 65.3% for vadadustat-treated patients and 64.5% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the ESA-treated patients study (Conversion) in vadadustat treated patients was 89.1% and 87.7% in darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa-treated patients were end-stage renal disease (27.5%/ 28.4%), hypertension (14.4%/ 14.8%), urinary tract infection (12.2%/ 14.5%),\ndiarrhea (13.8.%/ 8.8.%), peripheral oedema (9.9%/ 10.1%) and pneumonia (10.0%/ 9.7%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were 58.5% for vadadustat-treated patients and 56.6% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients.\nFor example, following the completion of our global Phase 3 clinical program for vadadustat, there was a review of hepatic safety across the vadadustat clinical program, which includes 8 completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in NDD-CKD patients, 10 completed Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, and two ongoing Phase 3b studies in DD-CKD patients, and 18 completed studies in healthy subjects (17 Phase 1 and one Phase 3). This review included a blinded assessment of all hepatic events in the studies by a panel of hepatic experts and analysis by an independent hepatic expert and our team. While hepatocellular injury attributed to vadadustat was reported in less than 1% of patients, there was one case of severe hepatocellular injury with jaundice, and we cannot guarantee that similar events will not happen in the future.\nSerious adverse events considered related to vadadustat and any other product candidates could have material adverse consequences on the development and potential approval of such product candidates and our business as a whole. Our understanding of adverse events in prior clinical trials of our product candidates may change as we gather more information, the FDA may not agree with our assessment of adverse events and additional unexpected adverse events may be observed in future clinical trials or in the market.\nAny of the above safety data or other occurrences could delay or prevent us from achieving or maintaining marketing approval, harm or prevent sales of Auryxia or, if approved, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, increase our expenses and impair or prevent our ability to successfully commercialize Auryxia, vadadustat or any other products or product candidates.\nIn addition, any post-marketing clinical trials conducted, if successful, may expand the patient populations treated with Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product we acquire or for which we receive marketing approval, within or outside of their current indications or patient populations, which could result in the identification of previously unknown undesirable effects, increased frequency or severity of known undesirable effects, or result in the identification of unexpected safety signals. In addition, as Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other products are commercialized, they will be used in significantly larger patient populations, in less rigorously controlled environments and, in some cases, by less experienced and less expert treating practitioners, than in clinical trials, which could result in increased or more serious adverse effects being reported. As a result, regulatory authorities, healthcare practitioners, third party payors or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any other products are associated with serious adverse effects, undermining our commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval\nWe may not be able to obtain marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, vadadustat or any other product candidate, or we may experience significant delays in doing so, any of which would materially harm our business.\nClinical trials, manufacturing and marketing of any product or product candidate are subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions. Before obtaining marketing approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years and marketing approval may never be achieved. Of the large number of drugs in development in the United States and in other jurisdictions, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA\u2019s and other jurisdictions\u2019 marketing approval processes and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite capital to continue to fund our development and commercialization efforts, we may be unable to successfully obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize vadadustat or any other product or product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired.\nWe and Otsuka, our collaboration partner, are not permitted to market vadadustat in the United States until we receive approval from the FDA, in the EU until we receive approval from the EMA, or in any other jurisdiction until the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in such jurisdiction is received. As a condition to receiving marketing approval for vadadustat, we may be required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. We submitted an NDA to the FDA for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients in March 2021. Our NDA submission was accepted for filing by the FDA in May 2021. The FDA assigned the application standard review and a PDUFA date of March 29, 2022. The FDA has indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the application for vadadustat. Vadadustat may not receive marketing approval at all and, if approved, the scope of approval may not include the treatment of anemia due to CKD in both DD-CKD and NDD-CKD adult patients. We remain cautious in our outlook for potential approval of vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult non-dialysis dependent patients as vadadustat did not meet the primary safety endpoint of the PRO2TECT program.\nFurther, vadadustat and any other product candidate may not receive marketing approval in the United States or the EU even if it is approved in other countries. For example, although vadadustat is approved in Japan for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD adult patients, such approval does not guarantee approval in the United States by the FDA or in the EU by the EMA for this indication or at all.\nObtaining marketing approval in the United States and other jurisdictions for any product candidate depends upon numerous factors, many of which are subject to the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities, including that regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner and, following completion of the review process, may not grant marketing approval or such marketing approval may be limited. Furthermore, approval of a drug does not ensure successful commercialization. For example, on September 23, 2015, the European Commission, or EC, approved Fexeric for the control of hyperphosphatemia in adult patients with CKD. Pursuant to the sunset clause under EU law, the EC\u2019s approval of Fexeric in the EU was contingent on, among other things, our commencing marketing of Fexeric within three years; although we successfully negotiated an extension to December 23, 2019, we did not commence marketing Fexeric by such date and therefore the Fexeric approval in the EU has ceased to be valid.\nWe could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom, or UK, as a result of the recent withdrawal of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK withdrew from the EU, effective December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the EU entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement would prevent us from commercializing vadadustat or any other product candidate, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, in the UK and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK and/or the EU for vadadustat or any other product candidate, which could significantly and materially harm our business. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended) as the basis for regulating medicines.\nIn addition, the safety concerns associated with the current standard of care for the indications for which we are seeking marketing approval for vadadustat may affect the FDA\u2019s, the EMA\u2019s or other regulatory authorities\u2019 review of the safety results of vadadustat. Additionally, these regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of adverse events. Further, the policies or regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval, may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. It is possible that vadadustat will never obtain marketing approval in certain jurisdictions or for some or all of the indications for which we seek approval. The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of vadadustat for many reasons including, among others:\n\u2022we may not be able to demonstrate that vadadustat is safe and effective in treating adult patients with anemia due to CKD to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials may only be modestly positive, or there may be concerns with the profile due to efficacy or safety;\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA for review and/or marketing approval;\n\u2022the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA may not approve the formulation, labeling or specifications we request for vadadustat;\n\u2022the FDA may approve vadadustat or any other product candidate for use only in a small patient population or for fewer or more limited indications than we request;\n\u2022the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical trials or repeat one or more clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA may require development of a REMS as a condition of approval or post-approval;\n\u2022the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA's onsite inspections may be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022we, or our CROs or other vendors, may fail to comply with GXP or fail to pass any regulatory inspections or audits;\n\u2022we or our third party manufacturers may fail to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements and guidance;\n\u2022the FDA may disagree with inclusion of data obtained from certain regions outside the United States to support the NDA for potential reasons such as differences in clinical practice from United States standards;\n\u2022the FDA could deem that our financial relationships with certain principal investigators constitute a conflict of interest, such that the data from those principal investigators may not be used to support our applications;\n\u2022although the FDA has indicated that they are not currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the NDA for vadadustat, the FDA may ask an Advisory Committee to review portions of the NDA, the FDA may have difficulty scheduling an Advisory Committee meeting in a timely manner or, if convened, an FDA Advisory Committee could recommend non-approval, conditions of approval or restrictions on approval, and the FDA may ultimately agree with the recommendations;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s review process and decision-making regarding vadadustat and any other product candidate may be impacted by the results of our and our competitors\u2019 clinical trials and safety concerns of marketed products used to treat the same indications as the indications for which vadadustat and any other product candidate are being developed;\n\u2022the FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with whom we contract; or\n\u2022the policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner that renders our clinical data insufficient for approval, or requires us to amend or submit new clinical protocols.\nIn addition, similar reasons may cause the EMA or other regulatory authorities to delay, limit or deny approval of vadadustat outside of the United States.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval, or if we fail to obtain approval of vadadustat for some or all of the indications for which we have sought approval, the commercial prospects for vadadustat may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProducts approved for marketing are subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties, including withdrawal of marketing approval, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, or product candidates, when and if any of them is approved.\nMarketing approvals may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or other conditions of approval, or contain requirements or commitments for potentially costly post-marketing studies and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, including REMS, or registries or observational studies. For example, in connection with the FDA approvals of Auryxia, we initially committed to the FDA to conduct certain post-approval pediatric studies of Auryxia under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA. With regard to the Hyperphosphatemia Indication for Auryxia, we committed to completing the post-approval pediatric study and submitting a final report to the FDA by December 31, 2019. With regard to our IDA Indication, we initially committed to completing the post-approval pediatric study and submitting a final report to the FDA by January 2023.With regard to the Hyperphosphatemia Indication, we did not complete and submit the post-marketing requirement pediatric clinical study report by December 31, 2019, and we received a notification of noncompliance with PREA. Our request to extend this deadline was denied, and the study is considered delayed. With regard to the IDA Indication, we did not meet a milestone relating to the post-approval pediatric study of Auryxia in a timely manner and received a notification from the FDA. Subsequently, the FDA agreed to extend the pediatric clinical study timelines for the IDA Indication. We subsequently communicated to the FDA that we would be delaying the start of the clinical trial to produce smaller size tablets. In response, the FDA issued a clinical hold until we manufacture the smaller tablets and provide the FDA with relevant information regarding the smaller sized product for review. If we are unable to complete these studies successfully, we will need to inform the FDA, have further discussions and, if the FDA finds that we failed to comply with pediatric study requirements, it could initiate proceedings to seize or enjoin the sale of Auryxia, which would have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize Auryxia and our ability to generate revenues from Auryxia.\nIn addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product for which we receive regulatory approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements and guidance. These requirements and guidance include manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping), the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of the product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. If we, our CMOs or other third parties we engage fail to adhere to such regulatory requirements and guidance, we could suffer significant consequences, including product seizures or recalls, loss of product approval, fines and sanctions, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs, and our development or commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nMoreover, the FDA and other regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on companies\u2019 communications regarding use of their products, and if we promote any approved product beyond its approved indications or inconsistent with the approved label, we may be subject to enforcement actions or prosecution arising from such activities. Violations of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws, insurance fraud laws, third party payor actions, shareholder actions and other lawsuits.\nPost-approval discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or relating to manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing, distribution, use or manufacturing of the product;\n\u2022withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022warning or untitled letters or clinical holds;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022REMS; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nFor example, we previously had three limited, voluntary recalls of Auryxia. These and any other recalls or any supply, quality or manufacturing issues in the future could result in significant negative consequences, including reputational harm, loss of customer confidence, and a negative impact on our financials, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and may impact our ability to supply Auryxia, VafseoTM, in Japan or vadadustat for commercial and clinical use.\nNon-compliance with the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance can also result in significant financial penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies and those of other regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulations that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other jurisdictions. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Compliance\nWe are subject to a complex regulatory scheme that requires significant resources to ensure compliance and our failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to government scrutiny or enforcement, potentially resulting in costly investigations, fines, penalties or sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nIn general, a variety of laws apply to us or may otherwise restrict our activities, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022laws and regulations governing the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials in the United States and other countries in which we are conducting such studies;\n\u2022anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and various other anti-corruption laws in countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022data privacy laws existing in the United States, the EU and other countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the GDPR, and state privacy and data protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, as well as state consumer protection laws;\n\u2022federal and state laws requiring the submission of accurate product prices and notifications of price increases;\n\u2022federal and state securities laws;\n\u2022environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; and\n\u2022international trade laws, which are laws that regulate the sale, purchase, import, export, re-export, transfer and shipment of goods, products, materials, services and technology.\nIn addition, our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse laws that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved, and any other products for which we may obtain marketing approval. As such, these arrangements are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations at federal, state and international levels. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the FDCA which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing and promotion and prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use;\n\u2022federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs, and laws requiring notification of price increases;\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, and violations of the FDCA, the federal government pricing laws, and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute trigger liability under the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (renamed the Open Payments Act) requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u2022analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and gift ban and transparency statutes, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state Medicaid or other programs, or non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and which are not preempted by federal laws and often differ from state to state, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022U.S. state laws restricting interactions with healthcare providers and other members of the healthcare community or requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement certain compliance standards, which vary from state to state.\nBecause of the breadth of these U.S. laws, and their non-U.S. equivalents, and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent healthcare reforms have strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the law. The Health Care Reform Act also amended the False Claims Act, such that violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are now deemed violations of the False Claims Act.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, such as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals, known as the PhRMA Code. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nEfforts to ensure that our business complies with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involves substantial costs and requires us to expend significant resources. One of the potential areas for governmental scrutiny involves federal and state requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit accurate price reports to the government. Because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, or potential qui tam complaints, and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes, recalculations, or defense costs that may have adverse legal or financial consequences. It\nis possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and would result in increased costs and diversion of management attention and could negatively impact the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of Auryxia or vadadustat, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government funded healthcare programs.\nWe will incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting any \u201coff-label\u201d use of Auryxia or any other product we may develop, in-license or acquire or if it is determined that any of our activities violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nPhysicians are permitted to prescribe drug products for uses that differ from those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, the FDA and other regulatory agencies do restrict manufacturer communications regarding unapproved uses of an approved drug. Companies are not permitted to promote drugs for unapproved uses or in a manner that is inconsistent with the FDA-approved labeling. There are also restrictions about making comparative or superiority claims based on safety or efficacy that are not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we may not promote Auryxia in the United States for use in any indications other than the Hyperphosphatemia Indication and the IDA Indication, and all promotional claims must be consistent with the FDA-approved labeling for Auryxia.\nPromoting a drug off-label is a violation of the FDCA and can give rise to liability under the federal False Claims Act, as well as under additional federal and state laws and insurance statutes. The FDA, the Department of Justice and other regulatory and enforcement authorities enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained, as well as the false advertising or misleading promotion of drugs. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug product. In addition, laws and regulations govern the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples, including the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1976 and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or to have otherwise engaged in false or misleading promotion or improper distribution of drugs will be subject to significant liability, potentially including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. It may also be subject to exclusion and debarment from federal healthcare reimbursement programs.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific communications concerning their products in certain circumstances. In addition, under some relatively recent guidance from the FDA, companies may also promote information that is consistent with the prescribing information and proactively speak to formulary committee members of payors regarding data for an unapproved drug or unapproved uses of an approved drug. We intend to engage in these discussions and communicate with healthcare providers, payors and other constituencies in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Although we believe we have put in place a robust compliance program and processes designed to ensure that all such activities are performed in a legal and compliant manner, Auryxia is our first commercial product in the United States, so our implementation of our compliance program in connection with commercialization activities is still relatively new.\nIn addition, if a company\u2019s activities are determined to have violated the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, this can also give rise to liability under the federal False Claims Act and such violations can result in significant fines, criminal and civil remedies, and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid. There is increased government focus on relationships between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians, pharmacies (especially specialty pharmacies), and other sources of referrals. Common industry activities, such as speaker programs, insurance assistance and support, relationships with foundations providing copayment assistance, and relationships with patient organizations and patients are receiving increased governmental attention. If any of our relationships or activities is determined to violate applicable federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, or other laws or regulations, the company and/or company executives, employees, and other representatives could be subject to significant fines and criminal sanctions, imprisonment, and potential exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid.\nDisruptions in the FDA and other government agencies caused by global health concerns or funding shortages could prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including global health concerns, government budget and funding levels, staffing shortages, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result of certain of these factors. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may increase the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, and on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. In 2020 and 2021, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. This risk-based assessment system identifies the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. In May 2021, the FDA issued a new report \u201cResiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight\u201d which included its detailed plan to move towards a more consistent state of operations; best-case, base-case and worst-case scenarios are identified, as well as the drivers that determine these scenarios and the impact these will have on inspection activities. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may also impose similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompliance with privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data when required, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, when required, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third party processors. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to sponsors with clinical trial sites in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial patients and investigators. In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, complying with the GDPR\u2019s requirements is rigorous and time intensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in the EU. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive\ndata, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSimilar privacy and data security requirements are either in place or underway in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that may be applicable to our activities, and a range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General all are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and federal levels. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR. Because of this, we may need to engage in additional activities (e.g., data mapping) to identify the personal information we are collecting and the purposes for which such information is collected. In addition, we will need to ensure that our policies recognize the rights granted to consumers (as that phrase is broadly defined in the CCPA and can include business contact information). Many other states are considering similar legislation. A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with current and any future federal and state laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties. We also face a threat of potential consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nLegislative and regulatory healthcare reform may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain for any products that are approved in the United States or foreign jurisdictions.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of vadadustat, or any other product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by legislative initiatives. Current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any FDA approved product, such as Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved, or any reimbursement that physicians receive for administering any approved product.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for Auryxia and any other approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize and the prices we obtain for Auryxia and may obtain for any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following:\n\u2022an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u2022an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal anti-kickback statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;\n\u2022extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes and regulatory have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester, through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed, but not yet adopted. For example, in July 2019, HHS proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement. Any new legislative or regulatory changes may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved, or the frequency with which Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved, is prescribed or used.\nWith the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause an estimated 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. The prior administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. In addition, CMS has proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nFurther, on December 14, 2018, a United States District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA and, therefore, because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On November 10, 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard this case. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed this case after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, all of the provisions in the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remain in effect. It is unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.\nThe costs and prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent United States congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nSpecifically, there have been several recent United States congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nFor example, the former administration issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.\nAt the same time, the administration may seek to limit Medicare Part D and public option drug prices through a tax penalty on manufacturers for increases in the cost of drugs and biologics above the general inflation rate. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, comprehensive COVID-19 relief legislation recently enacted under the current administration, includes a number of healthcare-related provisions, such as support to rural health care providers, increased tax subsidies for health insurance purchased through insurance exchange marketplaces, financial incentives to states to expand Medicaid programs and elimination of the Medicaid drug rebate cap effective in 2024.\nFurther, on July 9, 2021, the current administration signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat \u201cexcessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.\u201d On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with\nmanufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing.\nIt is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Auryxia and any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval or additional pricing pressures. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022the demand for Auryxia and any products candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement approval for Auryxia or any other approved product;\n\u2022our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nIn addition, in some countries, including member states of the EU the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take a significant amount of time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices, and in certain instances render commercialization in certain markets infeasible or disadvantageous from a financial perspective. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product and/or our product candidates to other available products in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third party payors or government authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, the commercial launch of our product and/or product candidates could be delayed, possibly for lengthy periods of time, we or our collaborators may not launch at all in a particular country, we may not be able to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the use and disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use of hazardous materials by our employees, contractors or consultants, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of Auryxia, Riona, Vafseo and vadadustat and if these collaborations are not successful or if our collaborators terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of Auryxia, Riona, Vafseo and vadadustat, and our business could be materially harmed.\nWe sublicensed the rights to commercialize Riona to JT and Torii in Japan. We entered into collaboration agreements with Otsuka to develop and commercialize vadadustat in the United States, Europe, China and certain other territories. We also entered into a collaboration agreement with MTPC to develop and commercialize vadadustat in Japan and certain other Asian countries. In addition, we entered into the Vifor Second Amended Agreement pursuant to which we granted Vifor Pharma an exclusive license to sell vadadustat to the Supply Group in the Territory. We may form or seek other strategic alliances, joint ventures, or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our and our partners' commercialization efforts with respect to Auryxia, Riona, Vafseo and our and our partners' development and commercialization efforts with respect to vadadustat and any other product candidates.\nWe may not be able to maintain our collaborations for development and commercialization and these collaborations may not be successful due to a number of important factors, including the following:\n\u2022collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated in accordance with the terms of the collaboration agreements and, if terminated, may make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect how we are perceived in scientific and financial communities, and may result in a need for additional capital and expansion of our internal capabilities to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable products and product candidates;\n\u2022if permitted by the terms of the collaboration agreements, collaborators may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus, availability of funding or other external factors such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022if permitted by the terms of the collaboration agreements, collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to our products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022if permitted by the terms of the collaboration agreements, we and our collaborator may have a difference of opinion regarding the development or commercialization strategy for a particular product or product candidate, and our collaborator may have ultimate decision making authority;\n\u2022disputes may arise between a collaborator and us that cause the delay or termination of activities related to research, development or commercialization of Auryxia or vadadustat and any other product candidate, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products and product candidates, if approved, in the most efficient manner or at all;\n\u2022a significant change in the senior management team, a change in the financial condition or a change in the business operations, including a change in control or internal corporate restructuring, of any of our collaborators, could result in delayed timelines, re-prioritization of our programs, decreasing resources or funding allocated to support our programs, or termination of the collaborations; and\n\u2022collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements.\nIf any of these events occurs, the market potential of Auryxia and vadadustat, if and where approved, and any other products or product candidates, could be reduced, and our business could be materially harmed. We also cannot be certain that, following a collaboration, the benefits of the collaboration will outweigh the potential risks.\nWe may seek to establish additional collaborations and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe will require substantial additional cash to fund the continued commercialization of Auryxia and the development and potential commercialization of vadadustat and any other product candidates. We may decide to enter into additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of vadadustat or Auryxia, both within and outside of the United States. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, divert management\u2019s attention, or disrupt our business.\nWe may not be successful in entering into additional collaborations as a result of many factors, including the following:\n\u2022competition in seeking appropriate collaborators;\n\u2022a reduced number of potential collaborators due to recent business combinations in the pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022an inability to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022any international rules, regulations, guidance, laws, risks or uncertainties with respect to potential partners outside of the United States;\n\u2022a potential collaborator\u2019s evaluation of Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product or product candidate may differ substantially from ours;\n\u2022a potential collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise; and\n\u2022restrictions due to an existing collaboration agreement.\nIf we are unable to enter into additional collaborations, we may have to delay or curtail the commercialization of Auryxia or vadadustat, if and where approved, reduce or delay its development program or other of our other development programs, or increase our expenditures and undertake additional development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop or commercialize Auryxia or vadadustat, in the case of commercialization, if approved.\nEven if we enter into additional collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our intellectual property, we may not be able to maintain them or they may be unsuccessful, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nRoyalties from commercial sales of vadadustat under our MTPC Agreement will likely fluctuate and will impact our rights to receive future payments under our Royalty Agreement with HCR.\nPursuant to the Royalty Agreement with HCR, we sold to HCR our right to receive the Royalty Interest Payments payable to us under our the MTPC Agreement, subject to the Annual Cap and the Aggregate Cap. After HCR receives Royalty Interest Payments equal to the Annual Cap in a given calendar year, we will receive 85% of the Royalty Interest Payments for the remainder of that year. After HCR receives Royalty Interest Payments equal to the Aggregate Cap, or we pay the Aggregate Cap to HCR (net of the Royalty Interest Payments already received by HCR), the Royalty Interest Payments will revert back to us, and HCR would have no further right to any Royalty Interest Payments. We received $44.8 million from HCR (net of certain transaction expenses) under the Royalty Agreement, and we are eligible to receive up to an additional $15.0 million under the Royalty Agreement if specified sales milestones are achieved for vadadustat in the territory covered by the MTPC Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nThe royalty revenues under the MTPC Agreement may fluctuate considerably because they depend upon, among other things, the rate of growth of sales of vadadustat in the territory covered by the MTPC Agreement. Negative fluctuations in these royalty revenues could delay, diminish or eliminate our right to receive up to the additional $15.0 million under the Royalty Agreement upon achievement of the specified sales milestones, our ability to receive 85% of the Royalty Interest Payments after the Annual Cap is achieved in a given calendar year, or our ability to receive 100% of the Royalty Interest Payments after the Aggregate Cap is achieved.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct all aspects of our product manufacturing and the loss of these manufacturers, their failure to supply us on a timely basis, or at all, or their failure to successfully carry out their contractual duties or comply with regulatory requirements, cGMP requirements, or guidance could cause delays in or disruptions to our supply chain and substantially harm our business.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities and do not expect to independently manufacture any product or product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party manufacturers to produce all of our commercial, clinical and preclinical supply, including the vadadustat drug product that we supply to our collaboration partner, MTPC, for\nthe Japanese market. Our reliance on third party manufacturers increases the risk that we will not have or be able to maintain sufficient quantities of Auryxia and vadadustat or the ability to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our and our partners' development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently have two suppliers of Auryxia drug substance, Siegfried Evionnaz SA (two approved sites) and BioVectra Inc. (one approved site), and one supplier of Auryxia drug product, Patheon Inc., or Patheon (three approved sites). We have entered into supply agreements with Esteve Qu\u00edmica, S.A. and STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, a subsidiary of Wuxi AppTec, or STA, for the commercial manufacture of vadadustat drug substance and Patheon Inc. and STA for the commercial manufacture of vadadustat drug product. If any of the following occurs, we may not have sufficient quantities of Auryxia and/or vadadustat to support our clinical trials, development, commercialization, or obtaining and maintaining marketing approvals, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations:\n\u2022we are unsuccessful in implementing additional redundant supply arrangements for commercial quantities of vadadustat or in maintaining our current supply arrangements for commercial quantities of Auryxia and vadadustat;\n\u2022our commercial supply arrangements for Auryxia or vadadustat are terminated;\n\u2022any of our third party manufacturers is unable to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us, including with respect to quality and quantity, or is unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture on the manufacturing lines included in our regulatory filings; or\n\u2022any of our third party manufacturers breaches our supply agreements, does not comply with quality or regulatory requirements and guidance, including cGMP or is subject to regulatory review or ceases its operations for any reason.\nIf any of our third party manufacturers cannot or do not perform as agreed or expected, including as a result of COVID-19, if they misappropriate our proprietary information, if they terminate their engagements with us, if we terminate our engagements with them, or if there is a significant disagreement, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into agreements with other third party manufacturers, which we may not be able to do in a timely manner or on favorable or reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, there may be a limited number of qualified replacement manufacturers, or the technical skills or equipment required to manufacture a product or product candidate may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third party, or a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on our current manufacturers or require us to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses in order to have another third party manufacture Auryxia or vadadustat. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the qualification of a new manufacturer and validation of manufacturing processes would negatively affect our ability to supply clinical trials, obtain and maintain marketing approval, or commercialize or satisfy patient demand for Auryxia and vadadustat, where approved, in a timely manner within budget or at all.\nMoreover, issues that may arise in any scale-up and technology transfer and continued commercial scale manufacture of our products may lead to significant delays in our development, marketing approval and commercial timelines and negatively impact our financial performance. For example, a production-related issue resulted in an interruption in the supply of Auryxia in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. This supply interruption negatively impacted Keryx\u2019s revenues in 2016. Although this supply interruption was resolved and we have taken and continue to take actions designed to prevent future interruptions in the supply of Auryxia, any future supply interruptions, whether quality or quantity based, for Auryxia and vadadustat, if and where approved, would negatively and materially impact our reputation and financial condition.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that are capable of manufacturing Auryxia and vadadustat for us and complying with cGMP regulations and guidance and other stringent regulatory requirements and guidance enforced by the FDA, EMA, PMDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation, which occur in addition to our own quality assurance releases. The facilities and processes used by our third party manufacturers to manufacture Auryxia may be inspected by the FDA and other regulatory authorities at any time, and the facilities and processes used by our third party manufacturers to manufacture vadadustat will be inspected by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities prior to or after we submit our marketing applications. Although we have general visibility into the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers, we do not ultimately control such manufacturing processes of, and have little control over, our third party manufacturers, including, without limitation, their compliance with cGMP requirements and guidance for the manufacture of certain starting materials, drug substance and finished drug product. Similarly, although we review final production, we have little control over the ability of our third party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Our third party manufacturers may experience problems with their manufacturing and distribution operations and processes, including, for example, quality issues, such as product specification and stability failures, procedural deviations, improper equipment installation or operation, utility failures, contamination, natural disasters and public health epidemics. We may also encounter difficulties relating to our own quality processes and procedures, including regulatory compliance, lot release, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. If our third party manufacturers cannot successfully\nmanufacture material that conforms to our specifications and regulatory requirements and guidance, or if we or our third party manufacturers experience manufacturing, operations and/or quality issues, including an inability or unwillingness to continue manufacturing our products at all, in accordance with agreed-upon processes or on currently validated manufacturing lines, we may not be able to supply patient demand or maintain marketing approval for Auryxia or secure and maintain marketing approval for vadadustat.\nIf the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities do not approve the facilities being used to manufacture vadadustat, or if they withdraw any approval of the facilities being used to manufacture Auryxia or VafseoTM, in Japan, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to continue commercializing Auryxia or develop, obtain marketing approval for or market vadadustat or our other product candidates, if approved.\nMoreover, our failure or the failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations or guidance, or our failure to oversee or facilitate such compliance, could result in sanctions being imposed on us or our third party manufacturers, including, where applicable, clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays in, suspension of or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of Auryxia or vadadustat, operating restrictions, receipt of a Form 483 or warning letter, or criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect the supply of Auryxia or vadadustat. For example, we previously had three limited, voluntary recalls of Auryxia. These and any other recalls or any supply, quality or manufacturing issues in the future and any related write-downs of inventory or other consequences could result in significant negative consequences, including reputational harm, loss of customer confidence, and a negative impact on our financials, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and may impact our ability to supply Auryxia, Vafseo in Japan or vadadustat for clinical and commercial use. Also, if our starting materials, drug substance or drug product are damaged or lost while in our or our third party manufacturers\u2019 control, it may adversely impact our ability to supply Auryxia or vadadustat, and we may incur significant financial harm.\nIn addition, Auryxia and vadadustat may compete with other products and product candidates for access to third party manufacturing facilities. A third party manufacturer may also encounter delays or operational issues brought on by sudden internal resource constraints, labor disputes, shifting priorities or shifting regulatory protocols including, in each case, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of these third party manufacturing facilities may be contractually prohibited from manufacturing Auryxia or vadadustat due to exclusivity provisions in agreements with our competitors. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact our third party manufacturers' ability to meet our demand, which could adversely impact our ability to supply Auryxia or vadadustat, and we may incur significant financial harm.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence on third parties for the manufacture of Auryxia and vadadustat may adversely affect our and our partners' ability to commercialize Auryxia and vadadustat, where approved, on a timely and competitive basis and any future profit margins.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and certain of our preclinical studies. If they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain or maintain marketing approval for Auryxia, vadadustat or any of our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct certain preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are currently relying, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our current and future preclinical studies and clinical trials. The third parties on whom we rely may fail to perform effectively, or terminate their engagement with us, for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022if they experience staffing difficulties;\n\u2022if we fail to communicate effectively or provide the appropriate level of oversight;\n\u2022if they undergo changes in priorities or corporate structure including as a result of a merger or acquisition or other transaction, or become financially distressed; or\n\u2022if they form relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.\nIf the third parties on whom we rely to conduct our trials fail to adhere to clinical trial protocols or to regulatory requirements, the quantity, quality or accuracy of the data obtained by the third parties may be compromised. We are exposed to risk of fraud or other misconduct by such third parties.\nAny of these events could cause our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including post-approval clinical trials, to be extended, delayed, suspended, required to be repeated or terminated, or we may receive untitled warning letters or be the subject of an enforcement action, which could result in our failing to obtain and maintain marketing approval of vadadustat or any other product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or fail to maintain marketing approval of Auryxia, or any other products, any of which would adversely affect our business operations. In addition, if the third parties on whom we rely fail to perform\neffectively or terminate their engagement with us, we may need to enter into alternative arrangements, which could delay, perhaps significantly, the development and commercialization of vadadustat, if approved, or any other product candidates.\nEven though we do not directly control the third parties on whom we rely to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and therefore cannot guarantee the satisfactory and timely performance of their obligations to us, we are nevertheless responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials and preclinical studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements, including GXP requirements, and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties, including CROs, will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or any of our CROs, their subcontractors, or clinical or preclinical trial sites fail to comply with applicable GXP requirements, the clinical data generated in our trials may be deemed unreliable or insufficient, our clinical trials could be put on hold, and/or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical and preclinical trials must be conducted with drug product that meets certain specifications and is manufactured under applicable cGMP regulations. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance, and the satisfactory maintenance of records and documentation.\nWe also rely on third parties to store and distribute drug product for our clinical trials. For example, we use third parties to store product at various sites in Europe and the United States to distribute to our clinical trial sites for our ongoing pediatric trials. Any performance failure on the part of our storage or distributor partners could delay clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization, resulting in additional costs and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nIf the licensor of certain intellectual property relating to Auryxia terminates, modifies or threatens to terminate existing contracts or relationships with us, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe do not own all of the rights to our product, Auryxia. We have licensed and sublicensed certain rights, patent and otherwise, to Auryxia from a third party, Panion & BF Biotech, Inc., or Panion, who in turn licenses certain rights to Auryxia from one of the inventors of Auryxia. The license agreement with Panion, or the Panion License Agreement, requires us to meet development milestones and imposes development and commercialization due diligence requirements on us. In addition, under the Panion License Agreement, we must pay royalties based on a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of product resulting from the licensed technologies, including Auryxia, and pay the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance costs related to the license. If we do not meet our obligations in a timely manner, or if we otherwise breach the terms of the Panion License Agreement, Panion could terminate the agreement, and we would lose the rights to Auryxia. For example, following announcement of the Merger, Panion notified Keryx in writing that Panion would terminate the Panion License Agreement on November 21, 2018 if Keryx did not cure the breach alleged by Panion, specifically, that Keryx failed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to commercialize Auryxia outside the United States. Keryx disagreed with Panion\u2019s claims, and the parties entered discussions to resolve this dispute. On October 24, 2018, prior to the consummation of the Merger, we, Keryx and Panion entered into a letter agreement, or the Panion Letter Agreement, pursuant to which Panion agreed to rescind any and all prior termination threats or notices relating to the Panion License Agreement and waived its rights to terminate the license agreement based on any breach by us of our obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Auryxia outside the United States until the parties executed an amendment to the Panion License Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Panion Letter Agreement, following consummation of the Merger. On April 17, 2019, we and Panion entered into an amendment and restatement of the Panion License Agreement, or the Panion Amended License Agreement, which reflects certain revisions consistent with the terms of the Panion Letter Agreement. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Panion Amended License Agreement. Even though we entered into the Panion Amended License Agreement, there are no assurances that Panion will not allege other breaches of the Panion Amended License Agreement or otherwise attempt to terminate the Panion Amended License Agreement in the future. In addition, if Panion breaches its agreement with the inventor from whom it licenses rights to Auryxia, Panion could lose its license, which could impair or delay our ability to develop and commercialize Auryxia.\nFrom time to time, we may have disagreements with Panion, or Panion may have disagreements with the inventor from whom it licenses rights to Auryxia, regarding the terms of the agreements or ownership of proprietary rights, which could impact the commercialization of Auryxia, could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive, could lead to the termination of the Panion Amended License Agreement, or force us to negotiate a revised or new license agreement on terms less favorable than the original. In addition, in the event that the owners and/or licensors of the rights we license were to enter into bankruptcy or similar proceedings, we could potentially lose our rights to Auryxia or our rights could otherwise be adversely affected, which could prevent us from continuing to commercialize Auryxia.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain and maintain patent protection on our drug product and technologies, and to successfully defend these patents against third party challenges. We seek to protect our proprietary products and technology by filing patent applications in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The process for obtaining patent protection is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in a cost effective or timely manner. In addition, we may fail to identify patentable subject matter early enough to obtain patent protection. Further, license agreements with third parties may not allow us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or the maintenance or enforcement of patents. Such third parties may decide not to enforce such patents or enforce such patents without our involvement. Thus, these patent applications and patents may not, under these circumstances, be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of the company.\nOur pending patent applications may not issue as patents and may not issue in all countries in which we develop, manufacture or potentially sell our product or in countries where others develop, manufacture and potentially sell products using our technologies. Moreover, our pending patent applications, if issued as patents, may not provide additional protection for our product.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents has emerged to date. Changes in the patent laws or the interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Accordingly, the patents we own or license may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative drug products or technologies or design around our patented drug product and technologies which may have an adverse effect on our business. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the United States that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in front of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that any related patent may expire prior to, or remain in existence for only a short period following, commercialization, which may significantly diminish our ability to exclude others from commercializing products that are similar or identical to ours. The patents we own or license may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage. Since we have licensed or sublicensed many patents from third parties, we may not be able to enforce such licensed patents against third party infringers without the cooperation of the patent owner and the licensor, which may not be forthcoming. In addition, we may not be successful or timely in obtaining any patents for which we submit applications.\nGenerally, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent if all other requirements of patentability are met. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Since publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Moreover, the laws enacted by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, or the Act, which reformed certain patent laws in the United States, introduce procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant, including inter partes review and post grant review. Similar laws exist outside of the United States. The laws of the European Patent Convention, for example, provide for post-grant opposition procedures that permit competitors to challenge, or oppose, our European patents administratively at the European Patent Office.\nIn July 2011, a third party filed an opposition to our issued European patents, European Patent No. 2044005, or the \u2019005 EP Patent, which covers vadadustat. During the oral proceedings, which took place on April 10, 2013, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office decided to maintain certain claims of the patent directed to a compound chosen from a group of eight compounds, including vadadustat, as well as claims to compositions and methods for treating various diseases including, but not limited to, anemia. Both parties appealed the decision of the Opposition Division. On February 27, 2018, we withdrew the \u2019005 EP Patent from appeal and filed a divisional patent application to pursue a focused claim set that includes claims for vadadustat, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating anemia. We cannot be assured that such claims in the divisional application will be granted by the European Patent Office. If such claims are not granted, or the scope of the claims is significantly narrowed, we may not be able to adequately protect our rights, provide sufficient exclusivity, or preserve our competitive advantage.\nWe may become involved in addressing patentability objections based on third party submission of references, or we may become involved in defending our patent rights in oppositions, derivation proceedings, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere,\nchallenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse result in any such proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged on such a basis in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. As a result of such challenges, we may lose exclusivity or freedom-to-operate or patent claims may be narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to prevent third parties from using or commercializing similar or identical products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our products.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and governmental patent agencies in other jurisdictions also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment (such as annuities) and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse in many cases can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market sooner than we expect, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, patents protecting our product candidate might expire before or shortly after such candidate is commercialized. Thus, our patent portfolio may not provide sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect our intellectual property where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require our employees, licensees, collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements, this may not be sufficient to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, in some cases, we share certain ownership and publication rights to data relating to some of our products and product candidates with research collaborators, licensees and other third parties. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of this information, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information will be at risk.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products and product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Consequently, the breadth of our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other countries. Competitors may use our technologies in countries where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may infringe our patents in territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain countries. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in countries outside of the United States could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage for our products and product candidates from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThe intellectual property that we own or have licensed and related non-patent exclusivity relating to our current and future products is, and may be, limited, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect the value of Auryxia.\nThe patent rights and related non-patent exclusivity that we own or have licensed relating to Auryxia are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us. For example, a third party may design around our owned or licensed composition of matter patent claims or market a product for the methods of use not covered by our owned or licensed patents.\nObtaining proof of direct infringement by a competitor for a method of use patent requires us to demonstrate that the competitors make and market a product for the patented use(s). Alternatively, we can prove that our competitors induce or contribute to others in engaging in direct infringement. Proving that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method by another has additional proof requirements. For example, proving inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor. If we are required to defend ourselves against claims or to protect our own proprietary rights against others, it could result in substantial costs to us and the distraction of our management. An adverse ruling in any litigation or administrative proceeding could prevent us from marketing and selling Auryxia, increase the risk that a generic or other similar version of Auryxia could enter the market to compete with Auryxia, limit our development and commercialization of Auryxia, or otherwise harm our competitive position and result in additional significant costs.\nMoreover, physicians may prescribe a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or \u201coff-label\u201d indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent.\nIn addition, any limitations of our patent protection described above may adversely affect the value of our drug product and may inhibit our ability to obtain a collaboration partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn the United States, the FDA has the authority to grant additional regulatory exclusivity protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations. If granted, this pediatric exclusivity may provide an additional six months which are added to the term of any non-patent exclusivity that has been awarded as well as to the regulatory protection related to the term of a relevant patent, to the extent these protections have not already expired.\nIn addition to pediatric exclusivity protection, we may seek additional non-patent exclusivity for vadadustat and other product candidates under other provisions of the FDCA such as new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity, or exclusivity for a new use or new formulation, but there is no guarantee that vadadustat or any other product candidates will receive such exclusivity. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which consists of the molecule(s) or ion(s) responsible for the action of the drug substance (but not including those portions of the molecule that cause it to be a salt or ester or which are not bound to the molecule by covalent or similar bonds). During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2).\nNDA that references an NDA product with NCE exclusivity may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of exclusivity for an NDA, particularly a 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application (for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug). This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. The three-year exclusivity period, unlike five-year exclusivity, does not prevent the submission of a competing ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. Instead, it only prevents the FDA from granting final approval to such a product until expiration of the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission (in the case of five-year exclusivity) or the approval (in the case of three-year exclusivity) of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct all of its own studies needed to independently support a finding of safety and effectiveness for the proposed product, or have a full right of reference to all studies not conducted by the applicant.\nWe received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the FDA requesting approval for generic versions of Auryxia tablets (210 mg iron per tablet), with the first received on October 31, 2018. We filed certain complaints for patent infringement relating to such ANDAs, and have entered into settlement and license agreements with each of the ANDA filers. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further information relating to the ANDAs, lawsuits and settlements.\nIn cases where NCE exclusivity has been granted to a new drug product, the 30-month stay triggered by such litigation is extended by the amount of time such that seven years and six months will elapse from the date of approval of the NDA for that product. Without NCE exclusivity, the 30-month stay on FDA final approval of an ANDA runs from the date on which the sponsor of the reference listed drug receives notice of a Paragraph IV certification from the ANDA applicant.\nWe cannot assure you that Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any of our potential future products will obtain such pediatric exclusivity, NCE exclusivity or any other market exclusivity in the United States, EU or any other territory, or that we will be the first to receive the respective regulatory approval for such drugs so as to be eligible for any non-patent exclusivity protection. We also cannot assure you that Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, or any of our potential future products will obtain patent term extension.\nThe market entry of one or more generic competitors or any third party\u2019s attempt to challenge our intellectual property rights will likely limit Auryxia sales and have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.\nAlthough the composition and use of Auryxia is currently claimed by 15 issued patents that are listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending against third parties attempting to invalidate or design around our patents or assert that our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable or not infringed, or in competing against third parties introducing generic equivalents of Auryxia or any of our potential future products. If our Orange Book-listed patents are successfully challenged by a third party and a generic version of Auryxia is approved and launched, revenue from Auryxia could decline significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe previously received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the FDA requesting approval for generic versions of Auryxia tablets (210 mg ferric iron per tablet). We filed complaints for patent infringement relating to such ANDAs, and subsequently entered into settlement and license agreements with all such ANDA filers to date See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further information relating to the ANDAs, lawsuits and settlements. It is possible that we may receive Paragraph IV certification notice letters from additional ANDA filers, and may not ultimately be successful in an ANDA litigation. Generic competition for Auryxia or any of our potential future products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nLitigation, including third party claims of intellectual property infringement, may be costly and time consuming and may delay or harm our drug discovery, development and commercialization efforts.\nWe may be forced to initiate litigation to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, or we may be sued by third parties asserting claims based on contract, tort or intellectual property infringement. In addition, third parties may have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that our products or other technologies infringe their patents. If we are required to defend against suits brought by third parties, or if we sue third parties to protect our rights, we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs, and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from operating our business. In addition, any legal action against our licensor, licensees or us that seeks damages or an injunction of commercial activities relating to Auryxia, vadadustat or any other product candidates or other technologies, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired, could subject us to monetary liability, a temporary or permanent injunction preventing the development, marketing and sale of such products or such technologies, and/or require our licensor, licensees or us to obtain a license to continue to use such products or other technologies. We cannot predict whether our licensor, licensees or we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by extensive litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future become a party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product and product candidates. As the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our drug candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.\nWhile our product candidates are in preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that the use of our product candidates in these preclinical studies and clinical trials in the United States falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e), which provides that it shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to sell, or sell within the United States or import into the United States a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As a result of the Merger, our portfolio includes a commercial product, Auryxia. Also, vadadustat, if approved, could be commercialized in the near future. Consequently, there is an increased possibility of a patent infringement claim against us. We attempt to ensure that our products and product candidates and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their use which we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance they do not, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nFibroGen has filed patent applications in the United States and other countries directed to purportedly new methods of using previously known heterocyclic carboxamide compounds for purposes of treating or affecting specified conditions, and some of\nthese applications have since issued as patents. To the extent any such patents issue or have been issued, we may initiate opposition or other legal proceedings with respect to such patents. We discuss the status of the opposition and/or invalidation proceedings against certain FibroGen patents in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere may be patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware with claims to compounds, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Also, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe.\nThird parties, including FibroGen, may in the future claim that our product and product candidates and other technologies infringe upon their patents and may challenge our ability to commercialize Auryxia and vadadustat, if approved. Parties making claims against us or our licensees may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our or their ability to continue to commercialize Auryxia or further develop and commercialize vadadustat or any other product candidates, including those that may be in-licensed or acquired. If any third party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our products or product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product or product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or our intended methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block or impair our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. We may also elect to enter into a license in order to settle litigation or in order to resolve disputes prior to litigation. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our products or product candidates. Should a license to a third party patent become necessary, we cannot predict whether we would be able to obtain a license or, if a license were available, whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. If such a license is necessary and a license under the applicable patent is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product or product candidate may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business.\nFurther, defense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties or redesign our products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe are currently involved in a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity lawsuit, opposition and invalidation proceedings, and may in the future be involved in additional lawsuits or administrative proceedings to challenge the patents of our competitors or to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate our trade secrets or confidential information. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement or misappropriation claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to prevent infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and held not infringed and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nIn addition, there may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents or applications currently identified as being owned by or licensed to us. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications.\nVarious administrative proceedings are also available for challenging patents, including interference, reexamination, inter partes review, and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome in any current or future proceeding in which we are challenging third party patents could require us to cease using the patented technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful, participation in interference or other administrative proceedings before the USPTO or a foreign patent office may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe are involved in an action against our competitors in the federal district court to obtain a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of certain patents of the competitors. In addition, we are currently involved in opposition and invalidation proceedings in the European Patent Office, the Japan Patent Office, and the Patents Court of the UK. These proceedings may be ongoing for a number of years and may involve substantial expense and diversion of employee resources from our business. In addition, we may become involved in additional opposition proceedings or other legal or administrative proceedings in the future. For more information, see the other risk factors under \u201cRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\u201d.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation and some administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during discovery. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from potential collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to our Business and Managing Growth\nIf we fail to attract, retain and motivate senior management and qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain and/or maintain marketing approval of and commercialize vadadustat or commercialize Auryxia.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success. We are also highly dependent on our executives, certain members of our senior management and certain members of our commercial organization. The loss of the services of our executives, senior managers or other employees could impede the achievement of our research, development, regulatory and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Losing key personnel subjects us to a number of risks, including the failure to coordinate responsibilities and tasks, the necessity to create new management systems and processes, the impact on corporate culture, and the retention of historical knowledge. Furthermore, replacing executives, senior managers and other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, obtain and/or maintain marketing approval of and commercialize Auryxia, vadadustat and other product candidates. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop, obtain and/or maintain market approval of and commercialize Auryxia and vadadustat and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to hire, train, integrate, and retain additional qualified personnel with sufficient experience. We may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies for similar personnel, particularly in our geographic region.\nWe also experience competition for the hiring of personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on contractors, consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating and executing our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our contractors, consultants and advisors may become employed by companies other than ours and may have commitments with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to grow and pursue our business strategy will be limited.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, including with respect to our employee base, and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we commercialize Auryxia and advance vadadustat through development and, if approved, commercialization, we have expanded and may need to further expand our capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. We may encounter difficulties in managing the size of our operations as well as challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business.\nWe have strategic collaborations for the commercialization of Riona and the development and commercialization of vadadustat, which is now being marketed under the trade name VafseoTM by our collaboration partner, MTPC, in Japan. Additionally, in the United States, we have strategic relationships with Vifor Pharma and Otsuka related to the commercialization of vadadustat, if approved. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic collaborators, consultants, vendors, suppliers and other third parties. These relationships are complex and create numerous risks as we deal with issues that arise.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Auryxia and vadadustat, if and where approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. This future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on the business and members of management. To manage our recent and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, procedures and processes. We may not be able to implement these improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems, procedures and processes. Moreover, the systems, procedures and processes currently in place or to be implemented may not be adequate for such growth. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIn addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant growth in our employee base. This growth to date has imposed, and future growth or attrition will continue to impose, significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit, hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees, including employees who joined us since the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to our limited financial resources, along with the competitive landscape for talent acquisition and retention in the biopharmaceutical industry, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit, train, and retain additional qualified personnel. In addition, we may need to adjust the size of our workforce as a result of changes to our expectations for our business, including as a result of the FDA's decision with respect to approval of vadadustat for DD-CKD and NDD-CKD, which can result in management being required to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth-related activities and related expenses.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our inventory process. If we are not able to remediate this material weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, which became required for us as of December 31, 2019, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. As of December 31, 2019, management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting relating to our inventory process was not effective because of a material weakness due to our failure to design and maintain effective controls over the completeness, accuracy and presentation and disclosure of inventory. Despite remediation efforts we undertook during fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continue to make, our management and independent registered public accounting firm concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting relating to our inventory process was not effective because we did not maintain effective controls related to the review of inventory reconciliations, the validation of the inventory costing, the periodic assessment of excess and obsolete inventory related reserves and verification that the existence of all inventories subject to physical inventory counts were correctly counted. Additionally, as revised and enhanced controls need to be in operation for a sufficient period of time and be tested to ensure that the controls are operating as designed, management has concluded that the material weakness cannot be considered remediated as of December 31, 2021. Although we have initiated remediation measures to address the material weakness, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to correct this material weakness in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that our internal controls will be effective in the future. Even if this material weakness is remediated in the future, our internal control over financial reporting could in the future have additional material weaknesses, deficiencies or conditions that could require correction or remediation.\nWe will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and maintain a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to remediate the material weakness relating to our inventory process described above and any future control deficiencies or material weaknesses, and improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and maintain a continuous\nreporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within applicable time periods may be adversely affected and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities as well as shareholder litigation which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nSecurity breaches and unauthorized use of our information technology systems and information, or the information technology systems or information in the possession of our collaborators and other third parties, could damage the integrity of our clinical trials, impact our regulatory filings, compromise our ability to protect our intellectual property, and subject us to regulatory actions that could result in significant fines or other penalties.\nWe, our collaborators, contractors and other third parties rely significantly upon information technology, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In addition, we and our collaborators, contractors and other third parties rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store clinical trial data, patient information, and other electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes, including operational and financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, payroll data and workforce scheduling information. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of company and customer information.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third party contractors maintain personal and other sensitive data on our and their respective networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our clinical trial patients and business partners. In particular, we rely on CROs and other third parties to store and manage information from our clinical trials. We also rely on third parties to manage patient information for Auryxia. The secure maintenance of this sensitive information is critical to our business and reputation.\nCompanies and other entities and individuals have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and information. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from individual hackers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be broadly targeted, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems or those of our vendors or third party service providers. A security breach, cyberattack or unauthorized access of our clinical data or other data could damage the integrity of our clinical trials, impact our regulatory filings, cause significant risk to our business, compromise our ability to protect our intellectual property, and subject us to regulatory actions, including under the GDPR and CCPA discussed elsewhere in these risk factors and the privacy or security rules under federal, state, or other local laws outside of the United States protecting confidential or personal information, that could be expensive to defend and could result in significant fines or other penalties. Cyberattacks can include malware, computer viruses, hacking or other unauthorized access or other significant compromise of our computer, communications and related systems. Although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to be prepared to respond to attacks, our preventive and any remedial actions may not be successful and no such measures can eliminate the possibility of the systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper access or disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, whether through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, ransomware, impersonation of authorized users, attacks by hackers or other means, can create system disruptions or shutdowns or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nAlthough we believe our collaborators, vendors and service providers, such as our CROs, take steps to manage and avoid information security risks and respond to attacks, we may be adversely affected by attacks against our collaborators, vendors or service providers, and we may not have adequate contractual remedies against such collaborators, vendors and service providers to remedy any harm to our business caused by such event. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, collaborators, or other contractors to disclose sensitive information or take other actions, including making fraudulent payments or downloading malware, by using \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails or other types of attacks. Our employees may be targeted by such fraudulent activities. Outside parties may also subject us to distributed denial of services attacks or introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our users\u2019 computers in order to gain access to our systems and the data stored therein. In the recent past, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against and, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and continuously become more sophisticated, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may be difficult to detect for a long time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or detective measures, and we might not immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents.\nSuch attacks, whether successful or unsuccessful, or other compromises with respect to our information security and the measures we implement to prevent, detect and respond to them, could:\n\u2022result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or fines, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties;\n\u2022lead to public exposure of personal information of participants in our clinical trials, Auryxia patients and others;\n\u2022damage the integrity of our studies or delay their completion, disrupt our development programs, our business operations and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022compromise our ability to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information;\n\u2022damage our reputation and deter business partners from working with us; or\n\u2022divert the attention of our management and key information technology resources.\nAny failure to maintain proper functionality and security of our internal computer and information systems could result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or marketing applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, under a variety of federal, state or other applicable privacy laws, such as HIPAA, the GDPR, or state data protection laws including the CCPA, harm our competitive position and delay the further development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, or impact our relationships with customers and patients.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate applicable laws, including the following:\n\u2022FDA and other healthcare authorities\u2019 regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to regulatory authorities, and those prohibiting the promotion of unapproved drugs or approved drugs for an unapproved use;\n\u2022quality standards, including GXP;\n\u2022federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and their non-U.S. equivalents;\n\u2022anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act or country-specific anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as various import and export laws and regulations;\n\u2022laws that require the reporting of true and accurate financial information and data; and\n\u2022U.S. state and federal securities laws and regulations and their non-U.S. equivalents, including those related to insider trading.\nWe conducted our global clinical trials for vadadustat, and are initiating pediatric trials, in countries where corruption is prevalent, and violations of any of these laws by our personnel or by any of our vendors or agents, such as our CROs or CMOs, could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trials and our business and could result in criminal or civil fines and sanctions. We are subject to complex laws that govern our international business practices. These laws include the FCPA, which prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries, such as CROs or CMOs, from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining any kind of advantage for the company. The FCPA also requires companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain adequate accounting controls. A number of past and recent FCPA investigations by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, have focused on the life sciences sector.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. Some of the countries in which we are conducting clinical trials have a history of corruption, which increases our risks of FCPA violations. In addition, the FCPA presents unique challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because in many countries\u2019 hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign government officials. Certain payments made by pharmaceutical companies, or on their behalf by CROs, to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nAdditionally, the UK Bribery Act applies to our global activities and prohibits bribery of private individuals as well as public officials. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both the offering and accepting a bribe and imposes strict liability on companies for failing to prevent bribery, unless the company can show that it had \u201cadequate procedures\u201d in place to prevent bribery. There are also local anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in countries where we are conducting clinical trials, and many of these also carry the risk of significant financial or criminal penalties.\nWe are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods, currency, products, materials, services and technology to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer other clinical trial supplies, and for our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants and vendors ability to travel, between certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.\nEmployee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. This could include violations of HIPAA, other United States federal and state laws, and requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the European Union Data Protection Directive. We are also exposed to risks in connection with any insider trading violations by employees or others affiliated with us.\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing our employees, contractors, consultants, agents or other representatives from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may impact our clinical trials, result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for us and any such individuals, including imprisonment, suspension or debarment from government contracting, withdrawal of our products, if approved, from the market, or being delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market. In addition, we may incur significant costs in implementing sufficient systems, controls and processes to ensure compliance with the aforementioned laws. The laws and regulations referenced above may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements that could adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling known or unknown risks or preventing losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, or if any such action is instituted against our employees, consultants, independent contractors, CROs, CMOs, vendors or principal investigators, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of our operations, disclosure of our confidential information and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf any of our service providers are later legally deemed to be employees, we could be subject to employment and tax withholding liabilities and other additional costs as well as other multiple damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nWe rely on independent third parties to provide certain services to us. We structure our relationships with these outside service providers in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. An independent contractor is generally distinguished from an employee by his or her degree of autonomy and independence in providing services. A high degree of autonomy and independence is generally indicative of an independent contractor relationship, while a high degree of control is generally indicative of an employment relationship. Tax or other regulatory authorities may challenge our characterization of services providers as independent contractors both under existing laws and regulations and under laws and regulations adopted in the future. If such regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our service providers are employees and not independent contractors, we would, among other things, be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay Social Security, Medicare and similar taxes, to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes, and to provide certain employee benefits. We could also be liable for unpaid past taxes, interest and other costs and subject to penalties. Likewise, our service providers themselves may later challenge their classification as independent contractors, which may result in additional damages, including back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. As a result, any legally binding determination that the service providers we characterize as independent contractors are actually our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe long-term effects of the Merger with Keryx may result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nWe completed the Merger on December 12, 2018, but have faced and may continue to face, adverse effects, some of which may be material, including, but not limited to (i) diversion of the attention of management and key personnel and potential disruption of our ongoing business, (ii) challenges of managing a larger company, including challenges of conforming\nstandards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies and compensation structures, (iii) difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, (iv) declines in our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and (v) potential liabilities, adverse consequences, increased expenses or other problems associated with our company following completion of the Merger. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and further diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial statements and prospects and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, following the Merger, we became responsible for Keryx\u2019s liabilities and obligations, including with respect to legal, financial, regulatory and compliance matters, including certain post-approval regulatory requirements with respect to Auryxia and obligations under collaboration, license, supply and manufacturing agreements. These obligations have, and will continue to, result in additional cost and investment by us and, if we have underestimated the amount of these costs and investments or if we fail to satisfy any such obligations, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nFurther, it is possible that there may be unknown, contingent or other liabilities or problems that may arise in the future, the existence and/or magnitude of which we were previously unaware. Any such liabilities or problems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLawsuits have been filed challenging the Merger and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Any monetary damages or other adverse judgment would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere is an ongoing appeal of a putative class action lawsuit filed in federal court, and ongoing putative class action lawsuits in state court, each filed by purported Keryx shareholders challenging the disclosures made in connection with the Merger. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further information relating to the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may be filed in the future. We have expended and may continue to be required to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits, including but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of Keryx and Akebia directors and officers, and the lawsuits, regardless of outcome, could have a negative effect on our reputation, stock price and results of operations. In addition, monetary damages or any other adverse judgment would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nOur financial statements include goodwill and an intangible asset as a result of the Merger. The intangible asset has become impaired and could become further impaired in the future under certain conditions. In addition, goodwill could become impaired in the future under certain conditions. Any potential future impairment of goodwill or intangible assets may significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $163.2 million of goodwill and a definite lived intangible asset from the Merger. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required annually, or more frequently upon certain indicators of impairment, to review our estimates and assumptions underlying the fair value of our goodwill and our definite lived intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present. Events giving rise to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted.\nConditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate such a review include, but are not limited to, Auryxia\u2019s commercial performance, our inability to execute on our strategic initiatives, the deterioration of our market capitalization such that it is significantly below our net book value, a significant adverse change in legal factors, unexpected adverse business conditions, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. To the extent we conclude that goodwill and/or definite lived intangible assets have become impaired, we may be required to incur material write-offs relating to such impairment and any such write-offs could have a material impact on our future operating results and financial position. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, in connection with a routine business review, we reduced our short-term and long-term Auryxia revenue forecast. This reduction was primarily driven by the impact of the September 2018 CMS decision that Auryxia would no longer be covered by Medicare for the treatment of the IDA Indication. While this decision does not impact CMS coverage for the use of Auryxia for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult patients with CKD on dialysis, or the Hyperphosphatemia Indication, it requires all Auryxia prescriptions for Medicare patients to undergo a prior authorization to ensure their use of Auryxia for the Hyperphosphatemia Indication. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $115.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, which was entirely allocated to our only intangible asset, the developed product rights for Auryxia, and made a corresponding adjustment to the estimated useful life of the developed product rights for Auryxia, which we again adjusted during the three months ended December 31, 2020. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used in our impairment testing, and the results of our testing, are discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If these estimates, judgments and assumptions change in the future, including if the Auryxia asset group does not meet its current forecasted projections, additional impairment charges related to goodwill or our intangible asset could be recorded in the future and additional corresponding adjustments may need to be made to the estimated useful life of the developed product rights for Auryxia, which could materially impact our financial position, certain of our material agreements, and our future operating results.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical and commercial use of Auryxia and vadadustat. For example, we may be sued if Auryxia or vadadustat allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or product candidate, negligence, strict liability and breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022delay or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to continue to develop Auryxia or vadadustat;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to study subjects or patients;\n\u2022product recalls or withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022decreased demand for Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize Auryxia or vadadustat, if approved; and\n\u2022a decline in our stock price.\nFailure to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our company. Although we maintain product liability insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have insufficient or no coverage. If we have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. We also may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover additional product liability risks that may arise. Consequently, a product liability claim may result in losses that could be material to our business.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we operate in a demanding regulatory environment, and we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and certain corporate governance practices. In particular, our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required and will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting-related expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing, or the testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls that we would be required to remediate in a timely manner. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Global Market or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our securities. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, including as a result of remote working by our employees in connection with COVID-19, our business and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company, nor can we predict the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur Ninth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Charter, and our Amended and Restated By-Laws, or Bylaws, as amended to date, contain provisions that eliminate, to the maximum extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, the personal liability of our directors and executive officers for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as a director or officer. Our Charter and our Bylaws also provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers and may indemnify our employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL our Bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers provide that:\n\u2022We will indemnify our directors and officers, as defined in our Bylaws, for serving us in those capacities or for serving other related business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Akebia and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022We are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022The rights conferred in our Bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\nAny claims for indemnification made by our directors or officers could impact our cash resources and our ability to fund the business.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. On December 12, 2018, we completed the Merger, which we believe has resulted in an ownership change under Section 382. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including amendments made by the CARES Act, includes changes to United States federal tax rates and the rules governing net operating loss carryforwards that may significantly impact our ability to utilize our net operating losses to fully offset taxable income in the future. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382. As a result, if we generate taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. At the state level, state net operating losses generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another state and there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nFurthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating United States taxable income. As described above under \u201c-Risks Related to our Financial Position, Need for Additional Capital and Growth Strategy,\u201d we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the United States taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a\nclaim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL our Charter or our Bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Under our Charter, this exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not apply to actions arising under federal securities laws, including suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our Charter described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable with respect to, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to legal proceedings that could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention, and we could be subject to additional legal proceedings.\nWe are currently subject to legal proceedings as described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and additional claims may arise in the future. In addition, securities class action and derivative lawsuits and other legal proceedings are often brought against companies for any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K following a decline in the market price of their securities. In connection with any litigation or other legal proceedings, we could incur substantial costs, and such costs and any related settlements or judgments may not be covered by insurance. In addition, if other resolution or actions taken as a result of legal proceedings were to restrain our ability to operate or market our products and services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We could also suffer an adverse impact on our reputation, negative publicity and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for holders or future purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for similarly situated biopharmaceutical companies specifically have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Since our initial public offering in March 2014, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low of $1.71 on February 14, 2022 to a high of $31.00 on June 20, 2014. The daily closing market price for our common stock has varied between a high price of $5.06 on February 8, 2021 and a low price of $2.26 on December 31, 2021 in the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2021. During this time, the price of our common stock has ranged from an intra-day low of $2.20 per share to an intra-day high of $5.14 per share. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, including, among others, developments related to and results of our research or clinical trials, developments related to our regulatory submissions and commercialization of Auryxia, vadadustat, if approved, and any other product candidates, announcements by us or our competitors of significant transactions or strategic collaborations, negative publicity around Auryxia or vadadustat, regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property, the recruitment or departure of key personnel, actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, market conditions in the biopharmaceutical sector and other factors beyond our control. As a result of this volatility, our shareholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it.\nIn addition, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the subject of securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for information concerning securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits initiated against Keryx and certain current and former directors and officers of ours and Keryx\u2019s. In addition, we could be the target of other such litigation in the future. Class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs, damage or settlement awards and a diversion of our management\u2019s resources and attention from running our business, which could materially harm our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or the sale of shares of our common stock by any of our directors, officers or significant shareholders will dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in Akebia and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nMost of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell such shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and based on the amounts reported in the most recent filings made under Section 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, BlackRock, Inc., or BlackRock, beneficially owned approximately 8.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock, the Vanguard Group, or Vanguard, beneficially owned approximately 7.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and State Street Corporation, or State Street, beneficially owned approximately 6.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. By selling a large number of shares of common stock, BlackRock, Vanguard, or State Street could cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we previously entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Investors\u2019 Rights Agreement, as amended, or the IRA, with our former director, Muneer Satter, who as of December 31, 2021 held less than 3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to the IRA, Mr. Satter has the right, subject to certain conditions and with certain exceptions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares common stock he owns, or to include his shares in registration statements that we may file or in public offerings of our shares of common stock. Following their registration and sale under the applicable registration statement, those shares would become freely tradable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Vifor Second Amended Agreement, in February 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with Vifor Pharma, or the Investment Agreement, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock to Vifor Pharma, representing 2.2% our outstanding common stock. Vifor Pharma beneficially owns an aggregate of 4.2% of our outstanding common stock. These shares have not been registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, or the Act, and were issued and sold in reliance upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, but if they are registered in the future, those shares would become freely tradable and, if a large portion of such shares are sold, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options, restricted stock units and a warrant, and in the future we may issue additional options, restricted stock units, warrants or other derivative securities convertible into our common stock. The exercise or vesting of any such options, restricted stock units, warrants or other derivative securities, and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock, could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Also, the Merger was financed by the issuance of shares of our common stock to shareholders of Keryx, comprising approximately 50.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, calculated based on our fully diluted market capitalization as of the date of signing the Agreement and Plan of Merger relating to the Merger. Keryx shareholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock they received in the Merger. Other Keryx shareholders, such as funds with limitations on the amount of stock they are permitted to hold in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock they received in the Merger. Such sales of our common stock could result in higher than average trading volume and may cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we currently have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement, which allows us to offer and sell up to $300 million in registered securities, such as common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, from time to time pursuant to one or more offerings at prices and terms to be determined at the time of sale, including a a sales agreement prospectus that covers the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $25,268,163 of our common stock that may be issued and sold from time to time under an amended and restated sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities by our employees or our other shareholders or by us under our shelf registration statement, pursuant to at-the-market offerings or otherwise, could dilute our stockholders, lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders maintain the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, in the aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing a significant percentage of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons could significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Charter and our Bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing certain members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022create a classified Board of Directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022require a supermajority vote of 75% of the holders of our capital stock entitled to vote or the majority vote of our Board of Directors to amend our Bylaws; and\n\u2022require a supermajority vote of 85% of the holders of our capital stock entitled to vote to amend the classification of our Board of Directors and to amend certain other provisions of our Charter.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers, changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business. Any payment of cash dividends in the future would be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and would depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the Loan Agreement preclude us from paying cash dividends and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14531, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AKBA"}
