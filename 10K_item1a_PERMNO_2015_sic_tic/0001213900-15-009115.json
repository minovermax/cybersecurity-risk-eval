{"cik": "1157817", "company": "SITO MOBILE, LTD.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have a history of operating losses.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a consolidated net loss of $4,528,193 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and a consolidated net loss of $4,510,514 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. As of September 30, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $138,937,724. We have not achieved profitability on an annual basis. We may not be able to reach a level of revenue to achieve profitability. If our revenues grow slower than anticipated, or if operating expenses exceed expectations, then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress the price of our stock.\nWe currently rely on AT&T to market our mobile messaging products and services to their customers and to generate the majority of our wireless applications revenues. The loss of or a change in our relationships with AT&T or their customers could materially reduce our revenues.\nOur success in mobile messaging is highly dependent upon maintaining successful relationships with AT&T and one of their customers. A significant portion of our revenue has always been derived from a single AT&T customer, and currently, nearly all of our wireless applications revenues are paid to us through AT&T. We expect that we will continue to generate a substantial majority of our wireless applications revenues through marketing relationships with AT&T for the foreseeable future. Our failure to maintain or build our relationships with AT&T and any reduction in the business received through AT&T would materially reduce our revenues and thus harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe AT&T customer to which the majority of our mobile messaging products and services are sold is currently reviewing proposals to continue services that have been submitted by AT&T with the Company as a subcontractor in the same manner as our current relationship, submitted by the Company as a direct vendor to AT&T\u2019s customer and submitted by competitors. The terms of the proposals, if accepted by AT&T\u2019s customer, will result in lower prices for our products and services, which may result in lower future revenues should mobile messaging volumes remain the same or continue at reduced levels. There can be no assurance that AT&T\u2019s customer will select AT&T or the Company to continue to provide services, and in the event that a competitor\u2019s proposal is chosen, our wireless applications revenue would decrease significantly.\nShould AT&T choose to promote another vendor\u2019s products and services over our products and services, our current and future business could be negatively impacted. In addition, AT&T has significant influence over the pricing of many of its suppliers, including us. We work together with AT&T to provide competitive pricing to the end users but AT&T ultimately has the final contracting authority with their clients who benefit from our products and services. If AT&T decides not to market or distribute our products and services or decides to terminate, not renew or modify the terms of its agreement with us, we may be unable to replace the agreement with acceptable alternatives which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to effectively protect or monetize our patents.\nWe have 22 patents which were issued from May 1998 to September 2015 related to mobile search, commerce, advertising and streaming media. To monetize some or all of our patents through sales would require access to potential buyers, which may be difficult for a smaller company such as us to obtain, and would also require completion of a buyer\u2019s due diligence investigation into the strength of our patents, demonstration to the buyer that owning such patents would have defensive or offensive value, and negotiation of the price and other terms of transaction documents.\nTo monetize some or all of the patents by licensing would require similar steps. In addition, we may not be able to monetize our patents as against companies who use our patented inventions unless they respect our ability to enforce our patents against them if they were not to agree to licenses.\nTo prosecute patent infringement actions may require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs. The outcome of litigation is never certain, and the amount of damages that might be awarded to us under any judgment is also uncertain. Even if a judgment is obtained it would be subject to appeal and to the uncertainties of collection. In addition, companies whose actual or planned activities are blocked by our patents could attempt to develop technological work-arounds in order to avoid compensating us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively protect or monetize our patents, or that we will be able to obtain a return equal to the fair intrinsic value of the patents. Any effort to obtain monetization could entail significant expenses and also opportunity costs.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future. Capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nOver the next twelve months we believe that existing capital and anticipated funds from operations may be sufficient to sustain our current level of operations and debt service. Inasmuch as the Company is pursuing the monetization of its intellectual property, which plans are subject to change, additional external financing relating to such efforts may be required. Increased acceleration in our core business, monthly principal payments on our debt and/or other economic influences might also necessitate additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able obtain additional debt financing, if at all or upon terms that will be acceptable to us or our existing secured lender.\nAs a result of the recent economic recession, and the continuing economic uncertainty, it has been difficult for companies to obtain equity or debt financing. While the credit markets have improved over the last year, it remains difficult for smaller companies to obtain financing on reasonable terms.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities. The terms of the securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities which may have a further dilutive effect.\nDebt securities, on the other hand, are senior to common stock, might contain onerous restrictive covenant and must be repaid when they mature. If we do not profitably use the money raised, we may not have enough cash on hand to repay the debt upon maturity without impairing our operations.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our services or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFurthermore, any additional debt or equity or other financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business and, further, we may not be able to continue operations if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our reported financial results.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur strategy envisions growing our business. There can be no assurance that such growth will occur, either to the extent our strategy envisions, or at all. Even if we do experience growth, if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial results could be adversely affected. Growth may place a strain on our management systems and resources. We must continue to refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. As we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf meet our capital needs;\n\u25cf implement, improve and expand our operational, financial, management information, risk management and other systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner;\n\u25cf allocate our human resources optimally;\n\u25cf identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified managers and employees;\n\u25cf develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; or\n\u25cf evolve a corporate culture that is conducive to success.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth and our operations our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and other business practices, and of board-level oversight, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, and this may decrease the trading price of our stock.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. We are responsible for reviewing and assessing our internal controls and implementing additional controls when improvement is needed. Failure to implement any required changes to our internal controls or other changes we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requirements regarding internal control over financial reporting, and other internal controls over business practices, are costly to implement and maintain, and such costs are relatively more burdensome for smaller companies such as us than for larger companies. We have limited internal personnel to implement procedures and must scale our procedures to be compatible with our resources. We also rely on outside professionals including accountants and attorneys to support our control procedures. Until fiscal year 2012 we did not have an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Governance and Nominating Committee composed of independent directors. We are working to improve all of our controls but, if our controls are not effective, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties which could lead to a decrease in the market price of our stock.\nOur management ranks are thin and failing to add key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur future performance depends substantially on the continued service and efforts of our senior management team. Our management\u2019s efforts will be critical to us as we continue to develop technology and if we lose any member of our senior management team, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technology and implementing our business plan. Additionally, we need to identify and hire additional senior managers to perform key tasks and roles. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, to perform key tasks and roles could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe acquired DoubleVision in July 2014 and completed our acquisition of the assets of Hipcricket in July 2015. Our growth strategy is dependent on the success of these acquisitions and in the future we may acquire additional companies, products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or any other future acquisition, and any acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current technologies;\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u25cf incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u25cf potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, intellectual property infringement and other legal and financial liabilities, among other things;and\n\u25cf potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to competition and, if technological conditions change, our competitors may be better able to react than we are.\nWe have many actual and potential competitors, many of whom may have more financial resources, personnel, intellectual property, development and/or reputational resources than we do. If we and our business do not grow larger, we will not be able to enjoy the brand power and economies of scale that many of our competitors enjoy. In addition, it is likely that our industry will be subject to rapid and profound technological changes. Our competitors may have more ability to react to such changes than we do which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to develop and timely introduce new products or services.\nThe planned timing and introduction of new products and services are subject to risks and uncertainties. Unexpected technical, operational, deployment, distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of new products and services, which could result in a loss of, or delay in, revenues.\nWe may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use, and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other arrangements with employees, actual and prospective customers and actual or prospective capital providers and their agents and advisors, and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights. These measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or services similar or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nAlthough we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights our efforts may not be successful. From time to time, we may litigate within the United States or abroad to enforce our issued or licensed patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others. Enforcing or defending our proprietary rights can involve complex factual and legal questions and could be expensive, would require management\u2019s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief.\nFurthermore, third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe their intellectual property rights. Although there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits against us, we may face litigation or infringement claims in the future. Infringement claims could result in substantial judgments, and could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail. A third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief which could effectively block our use of allegedly infringing intellectual property. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nDemand for the services we provide is not yet well established.\nBrand owners who are potential users of the services we provide must weigh their decisions in light of limited budgets for marketing and notification, the inertia of dealing with well-established providers of traditional modalities for marketing and notification, lack of experience with services such as ours and the perception (whether or not well founded) of technological risk and not-fully-demonstrated cost-effectiveness of our services. There are indications that the market among major brand owners for services such as ours may be in an early stage of development.\nSystem or network failures could reduce our sales, increase costs or result in a loss of end users of our products and services.\nAny failure of, or technical problem with, carriers\u2019, third parties\u2019 billing systems, delivery or information systems, or communications networks could result in the inability of end users to receive communications or download our products, prevent the completion of a billing transaction, or interfere with access to some aspects of our products. If any of these systems fails or if there is an interruption in the supply of power, an earthquake, superstorm, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or an act of war or terrorism, end users might be unable to access our offerings. For example, from time to time, our carriers have experienced failures with their billing and delivery systems and communication networks, including gateway failures that reduced the provisioning capacity of their branded e-commerce system. Any failure of, or technical problem with, the carriers\u2019, third parties\u2019 or our systems could cause us to lose end users or revenues or incur substantial repair costs and distract management from operating our business, or persuade retailers or brand owners that solutions utilizing our programs are not sufficiently reliable. This, in turn, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nTrading in our stock has been modest, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices. Moreover, modest volume can increase stock price volatility.\nThe average daily trading volume in our common stock for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately 18,352 shares. If trading in our stock continues at this level, it may be difficult for investors to sell or buy substantial quantities of shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Moreover, the market price for shares of our common stock may be made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused trading a relatively small number of shares.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCommon stock prices are often significantly influenced by the research and reports that securities analysts publish about companies and their business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our common stock is covered by securities analysts and our stock is downgraded, our stock price will likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we can lose visibility in the financial markets, which can cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated monetizations of our patents;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results (including whether we have achieved our key business targets and/or earnings estimates) and prospects;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, business successes, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market (particularly if overall trading volume is not high);\n\u25cf general market conditions and broader political and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies, and in particular the market prices of stock in smaller companies and technology companies have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe do not expect any cash dividends to be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, as well as any capital that may be raised in the future, to fund business growth. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on investment would be for the price of our common stock to appreciate. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nWe have aggressively issued common stock and other equity-based securities in support of our business objectives and initiatives. In the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 305,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2015, there were 17,155,748 shares outstanding. Potentially issuable common shares as of September 30, 2015 amounted to 2,261,671 shares and include 250 warrants and 2,261,421 options.\nThe holders of such options can be expected to exercise them at a time when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise price of these outstanding options. If these options to purchase our common stock are exercised, or other equity interests are granted under our 2008, 2009 or 2010 stock plans, or under other plans or agreements adopted in the future, such equity interests will have a dilutive effect on your ownership of common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. Such securities may be issued at below-market prices or, in any event, prices that are significantly lower than the price at which you may have paid for your shares. The future issuance of any such securities may create downward pressure on, or dampen any upward trend in, the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and/or effect changes in control. The provisions of our charter documents include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control. We think Section 203 does not currently apply to us, but in the future it may apply to us.", "PERMNO": 15644, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SITO"}
