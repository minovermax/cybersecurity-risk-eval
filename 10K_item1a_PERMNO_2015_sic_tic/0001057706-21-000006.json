{"cik": "1057706", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /PR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere follows a discussion about significant risks and uncertainties that could impact the Corporation\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including by causing the Corporation\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to the Corporation or its management and those that the Corporation or its management currently deems to be immaterial, could also affect the Corporation in a materially adverse way in future periods. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties the Corporation may face. See the discussion under \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the BSPR Acquisition\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the BSPR Acquisition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend, in part, on the ability to successfully manage the operations we acquired in the BSPR Acquisition as well as our legacy operations. The success of the BSPR Acquisition will depend on, among other things, the accuracy of our assessment of the quality of the acquired assets, and our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to integrate the acquired companies in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our or the acquired business\u2019s existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenue resulting from any loss of customers. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the BSPR Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nLoans that we acquired in the BSPR Acquisition may be subject to greater than anticipated impairment.\nWe have made fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording the BSPR Acquisition, including loans. Actual values of these loans could differ from our estimates, which could result in the Corporation not achieving the anticipated benefits of the BSPR Acquisition. In addition, BSPR\u2019s loan scoring system was different than ours, and, if the loan portfolio differs from our initial evaluation, we may have to make additional adjustments.\nGiven the economic conditions in Puerto Rico, we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to recognize greater than anticipated provisions to increase the ACL on the loans acquired that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOur inability to fully integrate BSPR\u2019s business into our operations could adversely affect our operations or results.\nOur future growth and profitability depend on our ability to successfully integrate BSPR\u2019s banking operations into our operations. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls and policies, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts have diverted and could continue to divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operations or results. The loss of key employees in connection with this acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct the combined operations. There can be no assurance that any of these executives will choose to continue working with us, or if they do, that we will be able to successfully integrate these executives as part of our management team in the combined business.\nThe BSPR Acquisition may result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to move their accounts or business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to the acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business or result in inconsistencies in customer service that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. There is no assurance that our integration efforts will not result in other unanticipated costs.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur additional significant costs related to the BSPR Acquisition.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur certain one-time restructuring charges in connection with the BSPR Acquisition. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses resulting from the BSPR Acquisition have consisted, and will continue to consist, of transaction costs related to the acquisition, systems conversion costs, financing arrangements and employment-related costs. We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the business integration of the two groups of companies. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies or synergies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nRisks Relating to the Corporation\u2019s Business\nOur level of non-performing assets may adversely affect our future results from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we continued to have a high level of nonaccrual loans, even though the level decreased by $5.6 million to $205.1 million as of December 31, 2020, or 2.7%, from $210.7 million as of December 31, 2019. Our nonaccrual loans represent approximately 1.73% of our $11.8 billion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we had a high level of total non-performing assets, even though they decreased by $23.9 million to $293.5 million as of December 31, 2020, or 7.5%, from $317.4 million as of December 31, 2019. If we are unable to effectively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nFirstBank relies primarily on customer deposits, the issuance of brokered CDs, and advances from the FHLB of New York to maintain its lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $216.2 million in brokered CDs outstanding, representing approximately 1% of our total deposits, and a reduction of $218.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $115.9 million in brokered CDs mature over the twelve months ending December 31, 2021, and the average term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was approximately 1.2 years. None of these CDs are callable at the Corporation\u2019s option.\nAlthough FirstBank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions change. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nAlternate sources of funding may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from FirstBank have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our TRuPs and other obligations. Our banking subsidiary is limited by law in its ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on its earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking subsidiary to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial condition. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital ratios, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject, among other things, to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and purchase. We recognize periodic credit loss expenses on loans, which leads to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain our ACL on loans at a level that our management deems to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan and lease portfolios. Management may fail to accurately estimate the level of loan and lease losses or may have to increase our credit loss expense on loans in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans, future increases in nonaccrual loans, foreclosure actions and loan modifications, changes in current and expected economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our ACL on loans and may require an increase in the credit loss expense on loans or the recognition of additional classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates based upon various assumptions and judgments as to specific credit risks, its evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio and, since the beginning of 2020, reasonable and supportable forecasts. The determination of the appropriate level of the ACL on loans inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, our ACL on loans may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our credit loss expense on loans could increase substantially.\nThe negative economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our financial results during 2020 in various respects, including by requiring that we increase our provision for credit losses due to the deterioration on forecasted macroeconomic variables. Although management makes qualitative adjustments to determine an appropriate level of the ACL, changes in macroeconomic variables considered for the reasonable and supportable forecasts, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may continue to cause significant quarter-to-quarter volatility in loss provisions, and have a significant negative effect on the ACL.\nAny such increases in our credit loss expense on loans or any loan losses in excess of our ACL on loans could have a material adverse effect on our future capital ratios, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s force-placed insurance policies could be disputed by the customer.\nThe Corporation maintains force-placed insurance policies that have been put into place when a borrower\u2019s insurance policy on a property was canceled, lapsed or was deemed insufficient and the borrower did not secure a replacement policy. A borrower may make a claim against the Corporation under such force-placed insurance policy and the failure of the Corporation to resolve such a claim to the borrower\u2019s satisfaction may result in a dispute between the borrower and the Corporation, which if not adequately resolved, could have an adverse effect on the Corporation.\nIf all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated statement of financial condition is determined to be related to credit factors, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an ACL on available-for sale debt securities of $1.3 million and an ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities of $8.8 million. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, credit-related impairment recognized in earnings was reported as part of net gain (loss) on investment securities, rather than as a provision for credit losses, in the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we recognized a total of $50 thousand and $0.5 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairments. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized or unrecognized losses in our investment securities portfolio of approximately $14.3 million as of December 31, 2020 is determined to be related to credit factors, we would recognize a charge to earnings through a provision for credit losses in the quarter during which such determination is made and capital ratios could be adversely affected. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with this portfolio is related to credit factors, increases in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment towards us. Any negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital or credit markets or might increase our cost of capital. Valuation and credit loss determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates, severity rates and macro-economic factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing funds.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding could be adversely affected by downgrades in our credit ratings. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity is to a certain extent contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation\u2019s current credit ratings and any downgrades in such credit ratings can hinder the Corporation\u2019s access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties relating to the loans sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and relate to, among other things:\n\uf0b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n\uf0b7 underwriting standards;\n\uf0b7 the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan files; and\n\uf0b7 the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.\nA loan that does not comply with the representations and warranties that we make may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and may not be saleable or may be saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but certain employees may make mistakes or may deliberately violate our lending policies.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted and periodically improve various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. Any improvements to our controls, procedures, policies and systems, however, may not be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage, or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events, such as the recent cybersecurity incident that we experienced on October 23, 2020, that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.\nWe have, in the past, been party to claims and legal actions by our customers, or subject to regulatory supervisory actions by the government on behalf of customers, relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. In the past, we have also been subject to securities class action litigation by our shareholders and we have also faced employment lawsuits and other legal claims. In any future claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us, resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. A securities class action suit against us in the future could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgements may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which has occurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.\nThe resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters, when unfavorable, has had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationships with many of our customers are predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, or our ability to attract and retain customers or obtain sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses, the market places in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If we fail to promptly address matters that bear on our reputation, our reputation may be materially adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or regulators, could also present operational challenges and could require the Corporation to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing the Corporation\u2019s financial statements, see Note 1 - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if events or circumstances lead management to believe the values of goodwill or other intangibles may be impaired. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nBased upon an annual comparison, if the estimated fair value of a reporting units exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit. Actual values may differ significantly from this assessment. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. Given the volatility in economic conditions and equity markets observed during 2020, triggered by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Corporation performed qualitative assessments during the first three quarters of 2020 to determine whether the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a triggering event that would indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Florida reporting unit was impaired. The Corporation concluded that the COVID-19 event was not a triggering event that required the performance of a quantitative test. With respect to the test for impairment of the goodwill of the Florida reporting unit for 2020, the Corporation bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis. Based on analyses under both the market and discounted cash flow approaches, the estimated fair value of the Florida reporting unit well exceeded the carrying amount of the entity, including goodwill as of the evaluation date. As of December 31, 2020, the book value of our goodwill was $38.6 million, which was recorded at the Bank. With respect to the BSPR acquisition, the Corporation concluded that there had been no significant events since the acquisition date related to the reporting units to which the goodwill recorded in connection wit the acquisition was allocated that could indicate potential goodwill impairment.\nIf an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Banks\u2019 earnings and thereby restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states that the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $329.3 million (net of a valuation allowance of $102.0 million, including a valuation allowance of $59.9 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiary FirstBank). Under Puerto Rico law, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including FirstBank, are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Accordingly, to obtain a tax benefit from NOLs, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income. To obtain the full benefit of the applicable deferred tax asset attributable to NOLs, FirstBank must have sufficient taxable income within the applicable carryforward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012, the carryover period is 10 years. Accounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. Due to significant estimates utilized in determining the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, in the future, the Corporation may not be able to reverse the remaining valuation allowance or may need to increase its current deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s judgments regarding tax accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Corporation provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP.\nFluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. In addition, the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (\u201cPRTD\u201d), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions and we may estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under applicable GAAP. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate and could result in a material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nChanges in the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions can materially affect our operations, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nFirst BanCorp. is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. FirstBank is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those regions. The USVI jurisdiction imposes income taxes based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code under the \u201cmirror system\u201d established by the Naval Service Appropriations Act of 1922. However, the USVI jurisdiction also imposes an additional 10% surtax on the USVI tax liability, if any.\nThese tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. In addition, legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nChanges in applicable tax laws in Puerto Rico, the U.S. or other jurisdictions or tax authorities\u2019 new interpretations could result in increases in our overall taxes and the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards may be limited.\nThe Corporation has Puerto Rico, U.S. and USVI sourced NOL carryforwards. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) limits the ability to utilize U.S. and USVI NOLs for income tax purposes, respectively, at such jurisdictions following an event of an ownership change. Generally, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage over a three-year testing period. Section 1034.04(u) of the 2011 PR Code is significantly similar to Section 382. However, Act 60-2019 amended the PR Code to repeal the corporate NOL carryover limitations upon change in control for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018.\nUpon the occurrence of a Section 382 ownership change, the use of NOLs attributable to the period prior to the ownership change is subject to limitations and only a portion of the U.S. and USVI NOLs, as applicable, may be used by the Corporation to offset the annual U.S. and USVI taxable income, if any. In 2017, the Corporation completed a formal ownership change analysis within the meaning of Section 382 covering a comprehensive period, and concluded that an ownership change, for U.S. and USVI purposes only, had occurred during such period. The Section 382 limitation has resulted in higher U.S. and USVI income tax liabilities than we would have incurred in the absence of such limitation.\nThe CARES Act of 2020 includes several provisions to stimulate the U.S. economy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these are tax provisions that temporarily modified the taxable income limitations for NOL usage to offset future taxable income, NOL carryback provisions and other related income and non-income based tax laws. The Corporation has evaluated such provisions and determined that the impact of the CARES Act of 2020 on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 was not significant.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the utilization of our U.S. and USVI NOLs could be further limited due to future changes in our stock ownership, as a result of either sales of our outstanding shares or issuances of new shares that could separately or cumulatively trigger an ownership change and, consequently, a Section 382 limitation. Any further Section 382 limitations may result in greater U.S. and USVI tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such a limitation and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. We may be able to mitigate the adverse effects associated with a Section 382 limitation in the U.S. and USVI to the extent that we could credit any resulting additional U.S. and USVI tax liability against our tax liability in Puerto Rico. However, our ability to reduce our Puerto Rico tax liability through such a credit or deduction will depend on our tax profile at each annual taxable period, which is dependent on various factors.\nRisks Relating to Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated. We may also be negatively affected if we fail to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products and services.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Furthermore, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive to implement than we anticipate.\nWhen we launch a new product or service, introduce a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity and cloud computing), or make changes to an existing product or service, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or we may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Significant failure in this regard could diminish our ability to operate our business or result in potential liability to our customers and third parties, increased operating expenses, weaker competitive standing, and significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nOur operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, as occurred in the recent cybersecurity incident we experienced on October 23, 2020. Any such future incidents could potentially disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk.\nFor example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. In addition, our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled, damaged or otherwise compromised as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Such events could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services or could result in the misuse of customer data. These events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters.\nIn any of such situations, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack. For example, on October 23, 2020, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that affected certain of the Corporation\u2019s service channels. In response, the Corporation temporarily limited certain bank services as a preventive action to protect its information and that of its customers. Refer to Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other risk factors herein for additional information regarding the cybersecurity incident and the associated risks. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data.\nWe frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, we review and strengthen our security systems in response to any cyber incident. Such strengthening entails significant costs and risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including potential business interruptions and the risk that this strengthening may not be one-hundred percent effective. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Such operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nFurther, third parties perform key aspects of our business operations, such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we believe that we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any significant problems caused by these third parties could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. For example, adverse impacts may arise from a vendor\u2019s failure to: maintain consistently available communication systems, handle current or higher volumes, provide services for any reason, or notify us of an adverse event. A vendor\u2019s poor performance of services may also impact operations. Additionally, if a third-party vendor obtains access to customer account data on our systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for the Corporation and our customers, including heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using our systems, losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for such losses, increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third-party vendor\u2019s security breach and harm to the Corporation\u2019s reputation arising from the perception that our systems may not be secure. In addition, financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, and other third parties. To access our network, products and services, our employees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties, including downstream service providers, the financial services industry and financial data aggregators, with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who have access to our customers' personal or account information, increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. Our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personal and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years, especially given the increasing sophistication and activities of organized computer criminals, hackers, and terrorists and our expansion of online customer services to better meet our customer\u2019s needs. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third-party providers, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks, such as computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks or other security breach tactics that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, destruction or theft of confidential, proprietary and other information, including intellectual property, of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damages to systems, or otherwise material disruption to our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations, both domestically and internationally.\nOn October 23, 2020, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that affected certain of the Corporation\u2019s service channels. As a result of the incident and the security protocols that we activated to protect the Corporation\u2019s information and that of its customers, certain bank services were temporarily suspended for our customers. We restored normal operations shortly thereafter and did not experience any material day-to-day impact from the temporary suspension. The investigation into the incident is substantially complete and no evidence of misuse of personal information has been identified. While we expect to send regulatory-required notices, in accordance with local laws, related to potential exposure of personal information of affected individuals, we believe that the incident has been contained and we do not expect the incident to have a material impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience material adverse effects, such as loss of customer confidence, further disruptions in our operations, or remediation, mitigation, compliance or legal costs.\nWe have a robust and thorough Information Security Program that continuously monitors cyber-related risks and ultimately ensures protection for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, a formal vendor management program is in place to oversee third-party and vendor risks. The Corporation\u2019s system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors is actively engaged in the oversight of the Corporation\u2019s continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience.\nFuture attacks or breaches could lead to other security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services, which, in turn, could result in unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents and develop our capabilities to respond and recover. Cyber threats are rapidly changing, and despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate future cyber-attacks or information or security breaches, nor may we be able to implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address such attacks or breaches. The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that the Corporation may need to take to investigate such attack may not be immediately clear, and it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope, extent, amount, and type of information compromised, at which time the impact on the Corporation and measures to recover and restore to a business as usual state may be difficult to assess. These factors may also inhibit our ability to provide full and reliable information about the cyberattack to our customers, third-party vendors and regulators, as well as the public. Even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. Internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of our system security, such as from the incident we recently experienced, could cause us serious negative consequences. These include the following potential future risks: loss of customers and business opportunities; costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; business or operational disruption; disruptions of new business opportunities; misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; and damage to our or our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems. In addition, these adverse consequences could result in the following legal risks: a violation of applicable data protection and privacy laws, including federal and state regulations, and other laws; litigation exposure; regulatory investigations or actions; fines, penalties or interventions; loss of confidence in our security measures; reputational damage; reimbursement or other compensatory costs; and additional compliance costs.\nAny of these adverse consequences could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, the Corporation carries insurance, including cyber insurance, which it believes to be commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations. Despite our current evaluation and preparation, our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential costs and other losses arising from cyber attacks, failures of information technology systems, or security breaches, and such insurance policies may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nRisks Relating to the Business Environment and Our Industry\nThe currently evolving situation related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a material adverse effect and may continue to have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and, since then, COVID-19 has spread widely to many countries and caused significant disruption in economic activity, including in the markets in which the Corporation operates. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 15, 2020, Puerto Rico\u2019s Governor issued several executive orders including, among other things, a stay-at-home mandate, the lockdown of non-essential businesses, nightly curfew, use of protective equipment, such as face masks, maintenance of a distance of at least six feet between citizens and limitations for travelers entering Puerto Rico. While the Puerto Rico government has since implemented a gradual reopening plan and substantially all parts of the economy of Puerto Rico have reopened, guidelines continue to affect how individuals interact and how businesses and government operate and, the operations and financial results of the Corporation have been and could continue to be adversely affected. Most industries have and will experience adverse impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the hospitality, office and retail real estate industries. The Corporation\u2019s exposure to these industries represented approximately 28% of the total construction and commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Corporation\u2019s businesses in the other jurisdictions in which it operates have also been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 26, 2020, Florida\u2019s Governor issued a stay-at-home order, and the state began to reopen essential operations through a phase-in process on May 4, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the state of Florida moved into the third and final phase of its reopening plan that essentially lifted all COVID-19 restrictions on restaurants and other businesses across the state. Additionally, in the USVI, the government issued a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020, which was subsequently extended until May 3, 2020. The USVI tourism-based economy reopened its borders for a second time on September 19, 2020, allowing access to both U.S. citizens and international tourists. The USVI in now in their \u201cSafer at Home\u201d phase of its COVID-19 path to a new normal, meaning that nonessential businesses can operate. In the BVI, the borders were closed to tourism for approximately nine months in 2020 and the BVI was among the last jurisdictions in the Caribbean to reopen its borders to commercial air traffic. On December 1, 2020, the government began its third phase in the border reopening process allowing international travel and the re-opening of the tourism industry albeit with strict restrictions in place, including multiple tests and full four-day quarantine. Additionally, seaports in the BVI remain closed and are set to reopen on March 1st, 2021.\nFinancial results for year ended December 31, 2020 were adversely affected by, among other things, a $171.0 million provision for credit losses. While the reserves required for non-PCD loans acquired in the BSPR acquisition resulted in a $38.9 million charge, the remaining charges to the provision were largely related to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on forecasted economic and market conditions. In addition, the various stay-at-home and lockdown orders resulted in reductions in the Corporation\u2019s transaction fee income, such as that from credit and debit cards, automated teller machines, and point-of-sale transactions, and an increase in deposit balances resulting from stimulus benefits received by customers, which requires the Corporation to maintain higher liquidity levels. Further, the Corporation implemented payment deferral programs to alleviate the hardships being experienced by the Corporation\u2019s borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and market conditions, the U.S. government and local governments have enacted stimulus packages and other programs and forms of relief, such as the SBA PPP program established by the CARES Act of 2020. It is possible that governments, regulatory authorities and central banks will implement additional stimulus packages or other programs or forms of relief. Loans that the Corporation grants under the SBA PPP are at below market interest rates, contributing to a reduction in the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin. There can be no guarantee of the effect that existing or any future such regulatory actions will have on the Corporation, its customers or the economy. The Corporation\u2019s participation in the SBA PPP and any other such programs or stimulus packages may give rise to claims, including by governments, regulators or customers or through class action lawsuits, or judgments against the Corporation that may result in the payment of damages or the imposition of fines, penalties or restrictions by regulatory authorities, or result in reputational harm. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nDepending upon the severity and duration of COVID-19\u2019s impact or the success of any COVID-19 vaccination programs, it is possible that the pandemic may lead to a prolonged economic downturn. If that should occur, the pandemic will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the Corporation by, among other things, altering consumers\u2019 spending, borrowing and saving habits and reducing investor confidence, increasing the probability of default on existing loans and any new loan issuances or additional loan modifications, decreasing demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services, increasing volatility in the financial markets and lowering interest rates, all of which would result in lower revenues and earnings and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s cash flow. Moreover, it is also possible that U.S. government and international banking regulatory authorities will implement additional or more stringent regulations on financial institutions, such as by increasing capital or leverage ratio requirements. The continuance or exacerbation of any of these factors could materially adversely affect our liquidity, net income, credit qualities, credit losses, availability of and access to funding sources, and overall results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition, and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic challenges in Puerto Rico.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006. Based on the most recent fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board on May 27, 2020, Puerto Rico\u2019s real GNP is estimated to have contracted by 4.0% in fiscal year 2020 with a limited recovery of 0.5% in the fiscal year of 2021, followed by negative real GNP growth in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 supported by the federal and local relief funds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and earthquakes. However, as stated in the certified fiscal plan, there remains considerable uncertainty about the ultimate duration and magnitude of the pandemic and thus the size of the economic losses. The certified fiscal plan estimated that over 401,000 Puerto Rico residents (including self-employed residents) would file for unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic with unemployment claims beginning to decline in June 2020 through fiscal year 2021, however, unemployment levels at the end of fiscal year 2021 were projected to be five percentage points higher than at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe certified fiscal plan accounts for the impact of federal funds granted through several government programs, including the CARES Act of 2020 and a $787 million local package of direct assistance to workers and businesses (the \u201cPuerto Rico COVID-19 Stimulus Package\u201d), which disbursements were forecasted to occur between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. Several U.S. government programs (the principal being the CARES Act of 2020) are estimated to provide aid to Puerto Rico and its residents of approximately $13.9 billion, which are primarily allocated for direct payments to Puerto Rico residents ($3.0 billion), relief to state and local governments ($2.2 billion), additional unemployment benefits ($3.5 billion) and the SBA PPP program ($1.7 billion). Similar to previous versions, the certified fiscal plan provides a roadmap for a series of fiscal and structural reforms in areas such as: (i) human capital and labor; (ii) ease of doing business; (iii) power sector reform; and (iv) infrastructure reform, and other fiscal measures; however, the certified fiscal plan provides a one-year delay in most categories of government rightsizing to allow the government to focus its efforts on implementation of efficiency reforms.\nDespite the overall fiscal and structural reforms, as well as the economic stimulus created by these packages, the certified fiscal plan forecasts a central government pre-contractual debt service deficit starting in fiscal year 2032, six years earlier than the previous certified fiscal plan projection, and a total primary surplus of about $8 billion between fiscal years 2020 and 2032, a 65% reduction when compared to the previous certified fiscal plan figure of $23 billion. However, before measures and structural reforms (i.e., the \u201cbaseline forecast\u201d), the certified plan estimates a pre-contractual debt service deficit for all years of the certified fiscal plan. The Government of Puerto Rico is expected to submit a revised Fiscal Plan to the PROMESA oversight board for review by February 20, 2021. This plan is anticipated to take into consideration the latest pandemic relief funding announcements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $394.8 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $204.5 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $201.5 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, and $133.9 million consisted of municipal revenue and special obligation bonds. Approximately 70% of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to Puerto Rico municipalities consisted primarily of senior priority obligations concentrated in four of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. The municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. During the second quarter of 2019, the PROMESA oversight board announced the designation of the Commonwealth\u2019s 78 municipalities as covered instrumentalities under PROMESA. Meanwhile, the latest fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities, but the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal problems and measures included in fiscal plans of other government entities. In addition to municipalities, the total direct exposure also included $13.6 million in loans to an affiliate of PREPA, $41.8 million in loans to an agency of the Puerto Rico central government, and obligations of the Puerto Rico government, specifically a residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA, at an amortized cost of $4.0 million as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (fair value of $2.9 million as of December 31, 2020).\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $106.5 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the PRHFA, compared to $106.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the PRHFA are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal for all loans under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently released audited financial statements of the PRHFA, as of June 30, 2016, the PRHFA\u2019s mortgage loans insurance program covered loans in an aggregate amount of approximately $576 million. The regulations adopted by the PRHFA require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loan insurance fund. As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date as to which information is available, the PRHFA had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $1.8 billion of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico, compared to $826.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Approximately 23% of the public sector deposits as of December 31, 2020 is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 77% is from public corporations, the central government and agencies, and U.S. federal government agencies in Puerto Rico.\nFurther deterioration in economic activity, delays in the receipt of disaster relief funds allocated to Puerto Rico, and the potential impact on asset values resulting from past or future natural disaster events, when added to Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position.\nDifficult market conditions have affected the financial industry and may adversely affect us in the future.\nGiven that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the U.S. and given the degree of interrelation between Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and that of the U.S., we are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, including factors such as unemployment and underemployment levels in the U.S. and real estate valuations. The deterioration of these conditions adversely affected us in the past and, in the future could adversely affect the credit performance of mortgage loans, and result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks:\n\uf0b7 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\uf0b7 The models used to estimate losses inherent in the credit exposure, particularly those under CECL, which took effect on January 1, 2020, require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the models.\n\uf0b7 Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties (including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government-sponsored entities and repurchase agreements) on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital or credit markets or other events, including deteriorating investor expectations.\n\uf0b7 Competitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\n\uf0b7 Expected future regulation of our industry may increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\uf0b7 There may be downward pressure on our stock price.\nAny future deterioration of economic conditions in the U.S. and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. During periods of rising interest rates, the refinancing of many mortgage products tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values.\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the economic slowdown in the U.S. in the late 2000s and early 2010s and in Puerto Rico since 2006. Unemployment, volatile interest rates and declines in housing prices have had a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our ability to sell loans, the prices we receive for loans, the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands could continue to harm our results of operations.\nFor many years, the USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that have deteriorated the overall financial and economic conditions in the area. According to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (\u201cBEA\u201d), real gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d) estimates show that the economy grew by 1.5% in 2018 after contracting at a compounded annual rate of 1.2% between 2012 and 2017. Growth in 2018 was primarily driven by consumer spending, private fixed investment and government spending, reflecting the influx of federal disaster recovery funding in the aftermath of the two major hurricanes in 2017. Although the USVI government expects this expansionary trend to be reflected in the 2019 GDP estimates, the external economic threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect growth in the short term. According to the USVI government, the results of a COVID-19 pandemic plan and other fiscal policy changes will not be evident until much later in fiscal year 2021 and beyond.\nSimilar to Puerto Rico, the USVI government has been processing stimulus checks and unemployment compensation checks. According to information published by the USVI government, as of January 31, 2021, the government had issued 52,908 unemployment insurance checks and an additional 29,348 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation checks, totaling approximately $93.6 million. In addition, as of January 31, 2021, the Virgin Islands Department of Labor had issued $13.1 million in Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to self-employed individuals. Furthermore, as of August 8, 2020, the government announced that 2,057 applications from Virgin Islands businesses have been approved for the SBA PPP, totaling more than $126.4 million.\nOn February 21, 2020, Moody\u2019s Investor Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) announced the completion of its periodic review of ratings of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (\u201cVI WAPA\u201d). The Caa2 senior electric revenue bonds rating is constrained by VI WAPA\u2019s limited unrestricted liquidity sources and unsustainable debt load, including its substantial unfunded pension liabilities, according to the rating agency. On May 28, 2020, Moody\u2019s announced the completion of its periodic rating review of the USVI government. Despite the recent improvement in the government\u2019s liquidity and short-term financial position, the Caa3 rating reflects the risk that the reemergence of a significant structural deficit, combined with the expected insolvency of the Government Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cGERS\u201d), will lead the government to restructure its debt.\nOn September 28, 2020, the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands announced that the $1 billion Internal Revenue Matching Fund securitization transaction had been suspended. On December 21, 2020, Governor Albert Bryan Jr. announced the call of the 33rd Legislature back into Special Session to re-address his proposal to refinance the Government of the Virgin Islands\u2019 debt to obtain a better interest rate and generate funds from the savings that can be used to shore up the GERS or any other use for the funds that the Senate chooses.\nPROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI government continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of the USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $61.8 million in loans to USVI government instrumentalities and public corporations, compared to $64.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Of the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020, public corporations of the USVI owed approximately $38.6 million and an independent instrumentality of the USVI government owed approximately $23.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\nWith respect to the BVI region, the government has indicated that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is felt most strongly in the tourism sector, which accounts for roughly one third of its GDP. Recent reports published by the BVI government projects a GDP decline of 13% to 17% in 2020, given the prevailing conditions in the tourism sector. In the BVI, the borders were closed to tourism for approximately nine months in 2020 and was among the last to reopen its border to commercial air traffic. On December 1, 2020, the government began its third phase in the border reopening process allowing international travel and the re-opening of the tourism industry albeit with strict restrictions in place, including multiple tests and a mandatory four-day quarantine. Additionally, seaports in the BVI remain closed and are set to reopen on March 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had loans totaling $151.0 million with exposure to the BVI region, primarily residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans, of which $16.4 million are in nonaccrual status.\nFurther deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position.\nCredit quality may result in additional losses.\nThe quality of our loans has continued to be under pressure as a result of continued recessionary conditions in the Puerto Rico region that have led to, among other things, high unemployment levels, low absorption rates for new residential construction projects and declines in property values. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments. A material decrease in the credit quality of the customer base or material changes in the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, allowance levels, asset impairments, liquidity, capital and results of operations.\nWe had a commercial and construction loan portfolio held for investment in the amount of $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Furthermore, given the slowdown in the real estate market, it may be difficult to dispose of the properties securing these loans upon any foreclosure of the properties. We may incur losses over the near term, either because of continued deterioration in the quality of loans or because of sales of problem loans, which would likely accelerate the recognition of losses. Any such losses could adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nChanges in collateral values of properties located in stagnant or distressed economies may require increased reserves.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios, whether located in Puerto Rico or elsewhere, would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2%, 19% and 30% of our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of construction, commercial mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively.\nWhether the collateral that underlies our loans is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI, or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of, and conditions within, each specific real estate market. Puerto Rico, where most of the collateral is located, has been in an economic recession since 2006. Sustained weak economic conditions that have affected Puerto Rico over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values. Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans held for investment in Puerto Rico amounted to $1.9 billion, or 76% of the total $2.4 billion commercial mortgage and construction real estate loan portfolios, which constituted 21% of the total loan portfolio held for investment.\nWe measure credit losses for collateral dependent loans based on the fair value of the collateral, which is generally obtained from appraisals, adjusted for undiscounted selling costs as appropriate. Updated appraisals are obtained when we determine that loans are collateral dependent and are updated annually thereafter. In addition, appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics, such as delinquency levels, and age of the appraisal. The appraised value of the collateral may decrease, or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans has required and, in the future, may require, increases in our credit loss expense on loans. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate shifts, such as increases in interest rates may reduce demand for mortgage and other loans, may reduce net interest income.\nShifts in short-term interest rates have reduced net interest income in the past and, in the future, may reduce net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences in the re-pricing structure of our assets and liabilities may result in changes in our profits when interest rates change. For instance, higher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce future demand for such loans, which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of loan interest income due to declines in volume.\nAdditionally, basis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the difference, also referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or basis, between the rates for two or more different instruments with the same maturity and occurs when market rates for different financial instruments or the indices used to price assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts. For example, the interest expense for liability instruments might not change by the same amount as interest income received from loans or investments. To the extent that the interest rates on loans and borrowings change at different rates and by different amounts, the margin between our variable rate-based assets and the cost of the interest-bearing liabilities might be compressed and adversely affect net interest income.\nAccelerated prepayments may adversely affect net interest income.\nIn general, fixed-income portfolio yields decrease if pre-payment amounts are invested at lower rates. Net interest income could also be affected by prepayments of MBS. Acceleration in the prepayments of MBS would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon the acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration in the prepayments of MBS would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by our investment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR after 2021 could adversely affect the interest rates we pay or receive, could prompt regulatory questions, result in costly disputes about relevant alternative interest rates and require costly systems and analytics changes.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not assured after 2021. In December 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), which is LIBOR\u2019s administrator, released a consultation that requested feedback on its intention to cease the publication of 1-Week and 2-Month USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 and the Overnight, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 Month USD LIBOR on June 30, 2023. The consultation was open for feedback until January 25, 2021, and the IBA will provide the feedback results to the FCA and publish a feedback statement.\nSignificant amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are referenced to LIBOR, and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the financial markets. Therefore, regulators and market participants in various jurisdictions have been working to recommend alternative rates to LIBOR for each respective currency that are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission\u2019s standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cAARC\u201d), identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. The Federal Reserve started to publish the SOFR in April 2018. The SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. During 2021, the ARRC plans to develop a SOFR reference rate term structure as liquidity increases in the SOFR derivatives market. At this time, it is uncertain whether SOFR will become the alternative reference rate to LIBOR. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\uf0b7 Adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the Corporation\u2019s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, primarily commercial and construction loans, private label MBSs, the Corporation\u2019s junior subordinated debentures, and certain other financial arrangements such as derivatives. As of December 31, 2020, the most significant of the Corporation\u2019s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities consists of $2.0 billion of commercial and construction loans (approximately 39% of the Corporation\u2019s commercial and construction loan portfolio, excluding SBA PPP loans), approximately $73 million of U.S. agencies debt securities and private label MBS held as part of the Corporation\u2019s available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, $151.5 million of Puerto Rico municipalities bonds held as part of the Corporation\u2019s held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio, and $183.8 million of junior subordinated debentures;\n\uf0b7 Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Corporation\u2019s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and\n\uf0b7 Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts.\nThe transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to, or development of, appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Corporation\u2019s risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as SOFR. The Corporation has developed a LIBOR Transition Working Group (\u201cLTWG\u201d) to define the scope and potential impact that the replacement of LIBOR will have across the Corporation's LIBOR-based assets and liabilities outstanding overseen by the Corporation\u2019s Management Investments & Asset-Liability Committee and the Board of Directors Asset-Liability Committee. The LTWG is composed by officers of the major areas affected, including: Treasury, Legal, Corporate Loans, Credit, Operations, Systems, Asset-Liability Management, Risk, Accounting, Financial Reporting, Public Relations, and Strategic Planning, which together, developed a LIBOR Transition workplan and timetable of their respective areas; identifying the systems, models, and applications impacted by the transition; and the resources necessary for the transition. The Corporation\u2019s transition efforts to date include, among others, the ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of an alternative reference rate for loans tied to LIBOR and the adherence to the LIBOR Fallbacks Protocol of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d). The Corporation is planning to adopt further fallback provisions recommended by the ARRC for loans referenced to LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nThe manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine financing transactions could be adversely affected by future failures of financial institutions and the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies and other institutional clients. In certain of these transactions, we are required to post collateral to secure the obligations to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral, or we may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty or under other circumstances.\nIn addition, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. The credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any losses resulting from our routine funding transactions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe are subject to certain regulatory restrictions that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.\nUnder federal law, financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a broader range of \u201cfinancial\u201d activities than those permitted to bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. A financial holding company that ceases to meet certain standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances, including the prohibition from undertaking new activities or acquiring shares or control of other companies. If we fail to comply with the requirements from our regulators, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement action and other adverse regulatory actions that might have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to certain limits (currently, $250,000 per depositor account). The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the DIF. In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and, if necessary, pays all insured deposits up to the statutory deposit insurance limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will require institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, such as FirstBank, to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support the DIF.\nThe FDIC may increase FirstBank\u2019s premiums or impose additional assessments or prepayment requirements in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC free to set this cap going forward.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, the regulation of our compensation practices may change in the future.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. As discussed above, the Corporation currently is subject to the 2010 interagency guidance governing the incentive compensation activities of regulated banks and bank holding companies. Our failure to satisfy these restrictions and guidelines could expose us to adverse regulatory criticism, lowered supervisory ratings, and restrictions on our operations and acquisition activities. In addition, the federal banking agencies have proposed regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that place restrictions on the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations with $1 billion or more in assets.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.\nThe recent change in administration and control of the U.S. Senate may cause regulatory uncertainty that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s legislative agenda and administrative mandates included certain deregulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry, including changes to the Volcker Rule, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Basel III capital requirements, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (the \u201cFSOC\u2019s\u201d) authority and other aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. On January 21, 2021, Joe Biden was sworn in as the U.S. president, and the Democratic Party obtained an equal number of seats in the U.S. Senate as the Republican Party, as well as maintained control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Many expect that the Biden administration will pursue stronger consumer financial protections, and it may act to overturn some of the prior Trump deregulatory initiatives; however, the legislative and regulatory agendas, as they relate to the financial services industry and the economy as a whole, of the Biden administration and the U.S. Congress currently remain uncertain.\nFurthermore, we and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, which may implement substantially different policies under the current administration and U.S. Congress. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nAdditional regulatory proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, could substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to residential real estate mortgages, or change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in other substantial and unpredictable ways. Determining the full extent of the impact on us of any such potential financial reform legislation, or whether any such particular proposal will become law, or the impact of regulatory changes in the absence of legislation at this point in time is highly speculative. However, any such changes may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or Board or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted. The ultimate effect that such legislation, if enacted, or regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to stringent regulatory capital requirements. Although First BanCorp. and FirstBank met general well-capitalized capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and we expect both companies will continue to exceed the minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements for well-capitalized status under the current capital rules, we cannot assure that we will remain at such levels. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain certain capital levels, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements for bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or any of the other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of our compliance with trade and economic sanctions requirements and rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11018, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBP"}
