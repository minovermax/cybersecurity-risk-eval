{"cik": "1366868", "company": "Globalstar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all of the information in this Report and our other past and future filings with the SEC, in evaluating and understanding us and our business. Additional risks not presently known or which we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business operations and the risks identified below may adversely affect our business in ways we do not currently anticipate. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe implementation of our business plan and our ability to generate income from operations assume we are able to maintain a healthy constellation and ground network, and products and services capable of providing commercially acceptable levels of coverage and service quality, which are contingent on a number of factors.\nOur products and services are subject to the risks inherent in a large-scale, complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology. Any disruption to our satellites, services, information systems or telecommunications infrastructure could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time.\nSince we launched our first satellites in the 1990\u2019s, some first-generation satellites have failed in orbit and have been retired and we expect others to fail in the future. Although we designed our second-generation satellites to provide commercial service over a 15-year life, we can provide no assurance as to whether any or all of them will continue in operation for their full 15-year design life. Further, our satellites may experience temporary outages or otherwise may not be fully functioning at any given time. There are some remote tools we use to remedy certain types of problems affecting the performance of our satellites, but the physical repair of satellites in space is not feasible. We do not insure our satellites against in-orbit failures after an initial period of six months, whether the failures are caused by internal or external factors.\nPrior to 2014 our ability to generate revenue and cash flow was impacted adversely by our inability to offer commercially acceptable levels of Duplex service due to the degradation of our first-generation constellation. As a result, we improved the design of our second-generation constellation to last twice as long in space and have 40% greater capacity compared to our first-generation constellation. Anomalies with our satellites have and may continue to develop that could affect their ability to remain in commercial service, and we cannot guarantee that we could successfully develop and implement a solution to these anomalies.\nWe initially designed our ground stations to operate with our first-generation satellites. Although our second-generation satellites are fully compatible with our first-generation products and services, our ground stations require upgrades to enable us to integrate our second-generation technology and service offerings with our second-generation satellites. We have entered into various contracts to upgrade our ground network. This work is in process, but the completion of these upgrades may not be successful.\nIn order to maintain commercially acceptable service long-term , we must obtain and launch additional satellites from time to time. As discussed in Note 7: Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements, we and Thales Alenia Space France (\"Thales\") may negotiate the terms of a follow-on contract for additional satellites, but we can provide no assurance as to whether we will ultimately agree on commercial terms for such a purchase. If we are unable to agree with Thales on commercial terms for\nthe purchase of additional satellites, we may enter into negotiations with one or more other satellite manufacturers, but we cannot provide any assurance that these negotiations will be successful.\nWe incurred operating losses in the past three years and these losses are likely to continue.\nWe incurred operating losses of $66.6 million, $95.9 million and $87.4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These losses resulted, in part, from non-cash depreciation expense related to our second-generation satellites placed into service in 2010, 2011 and 2013. Our second-generation satellites were designed to have a 15-year life from the date the satellites were placed into their operational orbit, and we estimate that we will continue to recognize high levels of depreciation expense commensurate with their estimated 15-year life.\nIf Terrapin Opportunity, L.P. fails to fulfill its capital commitment, our ability to execute our business plan will be adversely affected.\nOur current sources of liquidity include cash on hand ($7.5 million at December 31, 2015), future cash flows from operations, and funds available from our common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin Opportunity, L.P. (\u201cTerrapin\u201d) ($60.0 million at December 31, 2015). Our business plan assumes that Terrapin will provide all of these funds. We anticipate that we will draw the remaining amounts available under the Terrapin agreement to achieve compliance with our financial covenants under our Facility Agreement. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. If Terrapin is unable or fails to fulfill its commitment under this financial arrangement, or we fail to satisfy the conditions that permit us to draw these funds, it could materially and negatively impact our cash and liquidity, and our ability to continue to execute our business plan will be adversely affected.\nRapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures in addition to our existing contractual obligations and capital expenditure plans, which may require additional capital, which has not been arranged.\nThe space and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology. New technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards. Particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, greater flexibility, greater efficiency or greater capabilities, as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies. We must continue to commit to make significant capital expenditures to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive. Customer acceptance of the services and products that we offer will continually be affected by technology-based differences in our product and service offerings. New technologies may be protected by patents and therefore may not be available to us.\nThe hardware and software we currently utilize in operating our gateways were designed and manufactured over 15 years ago and portions have deteriorated. We have contracted to replace the digital hardware and software in the future; however the original equipment may become less reliable as it ages and will be more difficult and expensive to service. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement parts for the hardware before the new equipment and software is fully deployed. We expect to face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems.\nWe have various contractual agreements related to remaining amounts outstanding for upgrades to our ground infrastructure, including internal labor costs and interest on outstanding debt, which we expect will be reflected in capital expenditures primarily through 2016. The nature of these purchases requires us to enter into long-term fixed price contracts. We cannot be assured that operating cash flows and other previously committed funding will be sufficient to meet obligations over the term of these agreements. Restrictions in our Facility Agreement limit the types of financings we may undertake. Should we need to obtain additional financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain such financing in a timely manner, we may be unable to execute our business plan and fulfill our financial commitments.\nIf we do not develop, acquire and maintain proprietary information and intellectual property rights, it could limit the growth of our business and reduce our market share.\nOur business depends on technical knowledge, and we believe that our future success will be based, in part, on our ability to keep up with new technological developments and incorporate them in our products and services. We own or have the right to use our patents, work products, inventions, designs, software, systems and similar know-how. Although we have taken diligent steps to protect that information, the information may be disclosed to others or others may independently develop similar information, systems and know-how. Protection of our information, systems and know-how may result in litigation, the cost of which could be substantial. Third parties may assert claims that our products or services infringe on their proprietary rights. Any such claims, if made, may prevent or limit our sales of products or services or increase our costs of sales.\nWe license much of the software we require to support critical gateway operations from third parties, including Qualcomm and Space Systems/Loral Inc. This software was developed or customized specifically for our use. We also license software to support customer service functions, such as billing, from third parties which developed or customized it specifically for our use.\nIf the third party licensors were to cease to support and service the software, or the licenses were to no longer be available on commercially reasonable terms, it may be difficult, expensive or impossible to obtain such services from alternative vendors. Replacing such software could be difficult, time consuming and expensive, and might require us to obtain substitute technology with lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost.\nThe implementation of our business plan depends on increased demand for wireless communications services via satellite, both for our existing services and products and for new services and products. If this increased demand does not occur, our revenues and profitability may not increase as we expect.\nDemand for wireless communication services via satellite may not grow, or may even shrink, either generally or in particular geographic markets, for particular types of services or during particular time periods. A lack of demand could impair our ability to sell our services and develop and successfully market new services, or could exert downward pressure on prices, or both. This, in turn, could decrease our revenues and profitability and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and profitability over time.\nWe plan to introduce additional Duplex, SPOT, and Simplex products and services. However, we cannot predict with certainty the potential longer term demand for these products and services or the extent to which we will be able to meet demand. Our business plan assumes growing our Duplex subscriber base beyond levels achieved in the past, rapidly growing our SPOT and Simplex subscriber base and returning the business to profitability.\nThe success of our business plan will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the health, capacity and control of our satellites;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the health of our ground network;\n\u2022\nour ability to influence the level of market acceptance and demand for all of our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products and services that meet this market demand;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain current customers and obtain new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional business using our existing spectrum resources both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the costs of developing an integrated network providing related products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to market successfully our Duplex, SPOT and Simplex products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and deploy innovative network management techniques to permit mobile devices to transition between satellite and terrestrial modes;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell the equipment inventory on hand;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of user equipment that operates on our network;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar products and services and in persuading our customers to switch service providers; and\n\u2022\nour ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our target markets.\nWe depend in large part on the efforts of third parties for the sale of our services and products. If these parties, including our IGOs, are unable to do this successfully, we will not be able to grow our business in those areas and our future revenue and profitability could decline.\nWe derive a large portion of our revenue from products and services sold through independent agents, dealers and resellers, including, outside the United States, IGOs. Although we derive most of our revenue from retail sales to end users in the United States, Canada, a portion of Western Europe, Central America and portions of South America, either directly or through agents, dealers and resellers, we depend on IGOs to purchase, install, operate and maintain gateway equipment, to sell phones and data user terminals, and to market our services in other regions where these IGOs hold exclusive or non-exclusive rights.\nOur objective is to establish a worldwide service network, either directly or through IGOs, but to date we have been unable to do so in certain areas of the world, and we may not succeed in doing so in the future. We have been unable to establish our own gateways or to find capable IGOs for several important regions and countries, including India, China, and certain parts of Southeast Asia. In addition to the lack of global service availability, cost-effective roaming is not yet available in certain countries because the IGOs have been unable to reach business arrangements with one another. Further, our IGO's could fail to perform as expected or cease business operations. This could reduce overall demand for our products and services and undermine our value for potential users who require service in these areas.\nNot all of the IGOs have been successful and, in some regions, they have not initiated service or sold as much usage as originally anticipated. Some of the IGOs are not earning revenues sufficient to fund their operating costs due to the operational issues we experienced with our first-generation satellites. Although we expect these IGOs to return to profitability, if they are\nunable to continue in business, we will lose the revenue we receive for selling equipment to them and providing services to their customers. Although we have implemented a strategy for the acquisition of certain IGOs when circumstances permit, we may not be able to continue to implement this strategy on favorable terms and may not be able to realize the additional efficiencies that we anticipate from this strategy. In some regions it is impracticable to acquire the IGOs either because local regulatory requirements or business or cultural norms do not permit an acquisition, because the expected revenue increase from an acquisition would be insufficient to justify the transaction, or because the IGO will not sell at a price acceptable to us. In those regions, our revenue and profits may be adversely affected if those IGOs do not fulfill their own business plans to increase substantially their sales of services and products.\nWe rely on a limited number of key vendors for timely supply of equipment and services. If our key vendors fail to provide equipment and services to us, we may face difficulties in finding alternative sources and may not be able to operate our business successfully.\nWe have a limited quantity of our Duplex handsets remaining in inventory and have not contracted with a manufacturer to produce additional inventory. We have depended on Qualcomm as the exclusive manufacturer of phones using the IS 41 CDMA North American standard, which incorporates Qualcomm proprietary technology. We cancelled this contract in March 2013. Although we have contracted with Hughes and Ericsson to provide new hardware and software for our ground component, there could be a substantial period of time in which their products or services are not available and Qualcomm no longer supports our products and services.\nAdditionally, we depend on our contract manufacturers to provide us with our inventory. If these manufacturers do not take on future orders or fail to perform under our current contracts, we may be unable to continue to produce and sell our inventory to customers at a reasonable cost to us or there may be delays in production and sales.\nLack of availability of electronic components from the electronics industry, as needed in our retail products, our gateways, and our satellites, could delay or adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely upon the availability of components, materials and component parts from the electronics industry. The electronics industry is subject to occasional shortages in parts availability depending on fluctuations in supply and demand. Industry shortages may result in delayed shipments of materials, or increased prices, or both. As a consequence, elements of our operation which use electronic parts, such as our retail products, our gateways and our satellites, could be subject to delays or cost increases, or both.\nWe face special risks by doing business in developing markets, including currency and expropriation risks, which could increase our costs or reduce our revenues in these areas.\nAlthough our most economically important geographic markets currently are the United States and Canada, we have substantial markets for our mobile satellite services in, and our business plan includes, developing countries or regions that are underserved by existing telecommunications systems, such as rural Venezuela, Brazil, Central America and portions of Africa. Developing countries are more likely than industrialized countries to experience market, currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation. In addition, these countries present risks relating to government policy, price, wage and exchange controls, social instability, expropriation and other adverse economic, political and diplomatic conditions.\nConducting operations outside the United States involves numerous special risks and, while expanding our international operations would advance our growth, it would also increase these risks. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers;\n\u2022\nlack of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services;\n\u2022\nlack of recognition of our products and services;\n\u2022\nunavailability of or difficulties in establishing relationships with distributors;\n\u2022\nsignificant investments, including the development and deployment of dedicated gateways, as some countries require physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect the traffic coming to and from their territory;\n\u2022\ninstability of international economies and governments;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nexposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlocal domestic ownership requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirements that operational activities be performed in-country;\n\u2022\nchanging and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rates and exchange controls.\nThese risks could affect our ability to compete successfully and expand internationally. The prices for our products and services are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. Any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services to our international customers and, as a result, may reduce the competitiveness of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow internationally. Limited availability of U.S. currency in some local markets or governmental controls on the export of currency may prevent an IGO from making payments in U.S. dollars or delay the availability of payment due to foreign bank currency processing and approval. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect our ability to control the prices charged for the independent gateway operators' services.\nOur operations involve transactions in a variety of currencies. Sales denominated in foreign currencies involve primarily the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the Brazilian real. Certain of our obligations are denominated in euros. Accordingly, our operating results may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates for these currencies. Approximately 35% and 36% of our total sales were to customers located primarily in Canada, Europe, Central America, and South America during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our results of operations for 2015 and 2014 included gains of $3.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions. We may be unable to offset unfavorable currency movements as they adversely affect our revenue and expenses. Our inability to do so could have a substantial negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in all of our markets, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenues and make it more difficult for us to enter new markets.\nSatellite-based Competitors\nThere are currently three other MSS operators providing services similar to ours on a global or regional basis: Iridium, Thuraya, and Inmarsat. ORBCOMM Inc. is also emerging as a competitor in the machine-to-machine (\"M2M\") markets. The provision of satellite-based products and services is subject to downward price pressure when the capacity exceeds demand or as new competitors enter the marketplace with particular competitive pricing strategies.\nOther providers of satellite-based products could introduce their own products similar to our SPOT, Simplex or Duplex products, which may materially adversely affect our business plan. In addition, we may face competition from new competitors or new technologies. With so many companies targeting many of the same customers, we may not be able to retain successfully our existing customers and attract new customers and as a result may not grow our customer base and revenue.\nTerrestrial Competitors\nIn addition to our satellite-based competitors, terrestrial wireless voice and data service providers are continuing to expand into rural and remote areas, particularly in less developed countries, and providing the same general types of services and products that we provide through our satellite-based system. Many of these companies have greater resources, greater name recognition and newer technologies than we do. Industry consolidation could adversely affect us by increasing the scale or scope of our competitors and thereby making it more difficult for us to compete. We could lose market share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from the extension of land-based communication services.\nAlthough satellite communications services and ground-based communications services are not perfect substitutes, the two compete in certain markets and for certain services. Consumers generally perceive cellular voice communication products and services as cheaper and more convenient than satellite-based products and services.\nATC Competitors\nWe also expect to compete with a number of other satellite companies that plan to develop terrestrial networks that utilize their MSS spectrum. DISH Network received FCC approval to offer terrestrial wireless services over the MSS spectrum that previously belonged to TerreStar and ICO Global. Further, LightSquared continues its regulatory initiative to receive final FCC approval to build out a wireless network utilizing its MSS spectrum. Any of these competitors could offer an integrated satellite and terrestrial network before we do, could combine with terrestrial networks that provide them with greater financial or operational flexibility than we have, or could offer wireless services, including mobile broadband services, that customers prefer over ours.\nRestrictive covenants in our Facility Agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility and our inability to comply with these covenants could have significant implications.\nOur Facility Agreement contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. Complying with these restrictive covenants, as well as the financial and other non-financial covenants in the Facility Agreement and certain of our other debt obligations, as well as those that may be contained in any agreements governing future indebtedness, may impair our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to take advantage of other favorable business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected\nby events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with these covenants would be an event of default. An event of default under the Facility Agreement would permit the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness under the Facility Agreement. That acceleration would permit holders of our obligations under other agreements that contain cross-acceleration provisions to accelerate that indebtedness. See Part II, Item 7. Managements' Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Report for further discussion.\nPursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis. We may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions, including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture. These may include legal, organizational, financial and other costs and risks.\nIn addition, if we were to choose to engage in any major business combination or similar strategic transaction, we may require significant external financing in connection with the transaction. Depending on market conditions, investor perceptions of us, and other factors, we may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction. Our Facility Agreement and other debt obligations contain covenants which limit our ability to engage in specified forms of capital transactions without lender consent, which may be impossible to obtain. Any such financing, if obtained, may further dilute our existing stockholders.\nOur networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security risk and our use of personal information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.\nOur network and those of our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which could harm our reputation, cause demand for our products and services to fall or compromise our ability to pursue our business plans. Recently, a number of significant, widespread security breaches have occurred that have compromised network integrity for many companies and governmental agencies. In some cases these breaches reportedly originated from outside the United States. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. In addition, our customer contracts may not adequately protect us against liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business.\nWe collect and store data including our customers' personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations. In addition, if end users allege that their personal information is not collected, stored, transmitted, used or disclosed appropriately or in accordance with our privacy policies or applicable laws, we could have liability to them, including claims and litigation resulting from such allegations. Any failure on our part to protect information pursuant to applicable regulations could result in a loss of user confidence, reputation and the loss of customers which could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain our insurance coverages, and the insurance we obtain may not cover all liabilities to which we may become subject. As a result we may incur material uninsured or under-insured losses.\nThe price, terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services. The cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures or general conditions in the insurance industry. Higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our cost. In addition to higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles, shorter coverage periods and additional policy exclusions. Our insurance may not adequately cover losses related to claims brought against us, which could be material. Our insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nProduct Liability Insurance and Product Replacement or Recall Costs\nWe are subject to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products and services are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property. If any of our products proves to be defective, we may need to recall and/or redesign them. In addition, any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, we do not maintain any product recall insurance, so any product recall\nwe are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We regularly investigate potential quality issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers.\nBecause consumers use SPOT products and services in isolated and, in some cases, dangerous locations, we cannot predict whether users of the device who suffer injury or death may seek to assert claims against us alleging failure of the device to facilitate timely emergency response. Although we will seek to limit our exposure to any such claims through appropriate disclaimers and liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure investors that the disclaimers will be effective, claims will not arise or insurance coverage will be sufficient.\nGeneral Liability Insurance and In-Orbit Exposures\nOur liability policy, covers amounts up to \u20ac70 million per occurrence (with a \u20ac70 million annual limit) that we and other specified parties may become liable to pay for bodily injury and property damages to third parties related to processing, maintaining and operating our satellite constellation. Our current policy has a one-year term, which expires on October 19, 2016. Our current in-orbit liability insurance policy contains, and we expect any future policies would likewise contain, specified exclusions and material change limitations customary in the industry. These exclusions may relate to, among other things, losses resulting from in-orbit collisions, acts of war, insurrection, terrorism or military action, government confiscation, strikes, riots, civil commotions, labor disturbances, sabotage, unauthorized use of the satellites and nuclear or radioactive contamination, as well as claims directly or indirectly occasioned as a result of noise, pollution, electrical and electromagnetic interference and interference with the use of property.\nOur in-orbit insurance does not cover losses that might arise as a result of a satellite failure or other operational problems affecting our constellation. As a result, a failure of one or more of our satellites or the occurrence of equipment failures and other related problems could constitute an uninsured loss and could materially harm our financial condition.\nOur satellites may collide with space debris which could adversely affect the performance of our constellation.\nAlthough we have some ability to actively maneuver our satellites to avoid potential collisions with space debris, this ability is limited by, among other factors, uncertainties and inaccuracies in the projected orbit location of and predicted conjunctions with debris objects tracked and cataloged by the U.S. government. Additionally, some space debris is too small to be tracked and therefore its orbital location is completely unknown; nevertheless, this debris is still large enough to potentially cause severe damage or a failure of our satellites should a collision occur. If our constellation experiences satellite collisions with space debris, our service could be impaired. Any such collision could potentially expose us to significant losses. Further, from time to time we may decide to move and relocate satellites within our constellation to improve coverage and service quality. These actions may increase the risk of collision or damage to our satellites.\nChanges in tax rates or adverse results of tax examinations could materially increase our costs.\nWe operate in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The process of determining our anticipated tax liabilities involves many calculations and estimates which are inherently complex. We believe that we have complied, in all material respects, with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions. However, our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. If the applicable taxing authorities were to challenge successfully our current tax positions, or if there were changes in the manner in which we conduct our activities, we could become subject to material unanticipated tax liabilities. We may also become subject to additional tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws, which could in certain circumstances have a retroactive effect.\nIn January 2012 our Canadian subsidiary was notified that its income tax returns for the years ending October 31, 2008 and 2009 had been selected for audit. The Canada Revenue Agency reviewed the information provided by the Canadian subsidiary and issued an assessment for those years under audit. This assessment reduced our Canadian subsidiary's remaining net operating loss carryforward.\nAs a result of our acquisition of an independent gateway operator in Brazil during 2008, we are exposed to potential pre-acquisition tax liabilities. We and the seller reached an agreement in November of 2014 to fully settle the outstanding tax liability by the utilization of the Brazilian tax amnesty program. Pursuant to the settlement, the seller paid approximately $0.2 million of these liabilities. We calculated the amount of the tax liability to be settled after reducing for the accumulated fiscal losses related to the tax periods preceding the date of the agreement. If the amount required to satisfy the tax liabilities under the amnesty program differs from the amount paid by the seller, we and the seller will arrange a true-up. Until the Brazilian tax authorities confirm that there is no further liability, our subsidiary, the gateway operator, will maintain a reserve of $0.3 million. We may also be exposed to these or other pre-acquisition liabilities for which we may not be fully indemnified by the seller, or the seller may fail to perform its indemnification obligations.\nOur revenues are subject to changes in global economic conditions and consumer sentiment and discretionary spending.\nFinancial markets continue to be uncertain and could significantly adversely impact global economic conditions. These conditions could lead to further reduced consumer spending in the foreseeable future, especially for discretionary travel and related\nproducts. A substantial portion of the potential addressable market for our consumer retail products and services relates to recreational users, such as mountain climbers, campers, kayakers, sport fishermen and wilderness hikers. These potential customers may reduce their activities or their spending due to economic conditions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers. Some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. From time to time, the availability of credit is more restrictive. One of our largest customers is a reseller to oil and gas companies. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers' liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could reduce our cash flows.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Facility Agreement are at a variable rate. In order to mitigate a portion of our variable rate interest risk, we entered into a ten-year interest rate cap agreement. The interest rate cap agreement reflects a variable notional amount at interest rates that provide coverage to us for exposure resulting from escalating interest rates over the term of the Facility Agreement. The interest rate cap provides limits on the six-month Libor rate (\u201cBase Rate\u201d) used to calculate the coupon interest on outstanding amounts on the Facility Agreement. Our interest rate is capped at 5.5% if the Base Rate does not exceed 6.5%. Should the Base Rate exceed 6.5%, our Base Rate will be 1% less than the then six-month Libor rate. Regardless of our attempts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the interest rate cap, we still have exposure for the uncapped amounts of the facility, which remain subject to a variable interest rate. As a result, an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense, especially as the capped amount of the term loan decreases over time.\nThe loss of skilled management and personnel could impair our operations.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance and institutional knowledge of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, scientific or technical staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of business objectives by diverting management\u2019s attention to retention matters, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide communications service.\nNatural disasters could damage or destroy our ground stations resulting in a disruption of service to our customers. In addition, the collateral effects of such disasters such as flooding may impair the functioning of our ground equipment. If a natural disaster were to impair or destroy any of our ground facilities, we might be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time. Even if our gateways are not affected by natural disasters, our service could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages the public switch telephone network or terrestrial wireless networks or our ability to connect to the public switch telephone network or terrestrial wireless networks. Additionally, there are inherent dangers and risk associated with our satellite operations, including the risk of increased radiation and possibility of in-orbit collisions with other objects. Any such failures, collisions or service disruptions could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have had material weaknesses in our internal controls in the past and we cannot assure you that in the future additional material weaknesses will not recur, exist or otherwise be identified.\nOur internal control processes, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot assure you that in the future additional material weaknesses will not recur, exist or otherwise be identified. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our processes, procedures and controls and will make changes as management determines appropriate. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and operating results may be adversely affected, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, there may be a negative effect on our stock price, and we may be subject to civil or criminal investigations and penalties.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation, which mandates how we may operate our business and may increase our cost of providing services, slow our expansion into new markets and subject our services to additional competitive pressures.\nOur ownership and operation of an MSS system are subject to significant regulation in the United States by the FCC and in foreign jurisdictions by similar authorities. Additionally, our use of our licensed spectrum globally is subject to coordination by the ITU. Our second-generation constellation has been licensed and registered in France. The rules and regulations of the FCC or these foreign authorities may change and may not continue to permit our operations as currently conducted or as we plan to conduct them. Further, certain foreign jurisdictions may decide to allow additional uses within our ITU-allocation of spectrum that may be incompatible with our continued provision of MSS.\nFailure to provide services in accordance with the terms of our licenses or failure to operate our satellites, ground stations, or other terrestrial facilities (including those necessary to provide ATC services) as required by our licenses and applicable government regulations could result in the imposition of government sanctions against us, up to and including cancellation of our licenses.\nOur system requires regulatory authorization in each of the markets in which we or the IGOs provide service. We and the IGOs may not be able to obtain or retain all regulatory approvals needed for operations. For example, the company with which the original owners of our first-generation network contracted to establish an independent gateway operation in South Africa was unable to obtain an operating license from the Republic of South Africa and abandoned the business in 2001. Regulatory changes, such as those resulting from judicial decisions or adoption of treaties, legislation or regulation in countries where we operate or intend to operate, may also significantly affect our business. Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of the IGOs and/or persons with which we or they do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.\nOur current regulatory approvals could now be, or could become, insufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any additional necessary approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer services, and applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions could become unduly burdensome.\nOur operations are subject to certain regulations of the United States State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (the export of satellites and related technical data), United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (financial transactions and customers) and the United States Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (our gateways and phones). These regulations may limit or delay our ability to operate in a particular country or engage in transactions with certain parties. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations in any country, we could be subject to sanctions that could affect, materially and adversely, our ability to operate in that country. Failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to use our assigned radio frequency spectrum and to distribute our products in certain countries could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and on our overall competitive position.\nOur business plan to use a portion of our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services depends upon action by the FCC, which we cannot control.\nOur business plan includes utilizing approximately 20 MHz of our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services, including mobile broadband applications, within the United States. In pursuit of these plans, in November 2013, the FCC proposed rules, which, if adopted, would enable us to offer TLPS over a portion of our licensed MSS spectrum, as well as to permit the non-exclusive use of the adjacent unlicensed spectrum. The proposed rules would substantially revise the gating criteria for terrestrial use of our spectrum and would allow us to provide low power terrestrial broadband services over our licensed MSS spectrum. We believe TLPS represents a differentiated, premium, and immediate solution to Wi-Fi congestion. If the FCC does not ultimately adopt satisfactory rules, our anticipated future revenues and profitability could be reduced. We can provide no assurance that the FCC will make any final decision in their proceeding or whether any final decision will be satisfactory to us. If we are unable to proceed as anticipated, then our only ability to utilize our MSS spectrum for terrestrial applications may be pursuant to the existing ATC regulatory regime that requires more restrictive conditions.\nOther future regulatory decisions could also reduce our existing spectrum allocation or impose additional spectrum sharing agreements on us, which could adversely affect our services and operations.\nUnder the FCC's plan for MSS in our frequency bands, we must share frequencies in the United States with other licensed MSS operators. To date, there are no other authorized CDMA-based MSS operators and no pending applications for authorization. However, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may require us to share spectrum with other systems that are not currently licensed by the United States or any other jurisdiction. On February 11, 2013, Iridium filed its own petition for rulemaking seeking to have the FCC reallocate 2.725 MHz of \"Big LEO\" spectrum from 1616-1618.725 MHz to Iridium\u2019s exclusive use. Iridium also filed a motion to consolidate its petition with our petition for rulemaking. Although the FCC has received comments on Iridium\u2019s petition, it has not taken any substantive action with respect to it. An adverse result in this proceeding could materially affect our ability to provide both Duplex and Simplex mobile satellite services.\nWe registered our second-generation constellation with the ITU through France rather than the United States. The French radiofrequency spectrum regulatory agency, ANFR, submitted the technical papers filing to the ITU on our behalf in July 2009. As with the first-generation constellation, the ITU requires us to coordinate our spectrum assignments with other administrators and operators that use any portion of our spectrum frequency bands. We are actively engaged in but cannot predict how long the coordination process will take; however, we are able to use the frequencies during the coordination process in accordance with our national licenses.\nIn March 2014, the FCC adopted an order related to the 5 GHz band which, among other things, expanded the use of unlicensed terrestrial mobile broadband services within our C-band Forward Link (Earth Station to Satellite) which operates at 5091-5250 MHz. We had previously filed comments in opposition to these changes to the technical rules due to the substantial risk of harmful interference that these deployments could have on our system. As part of this order, the FCC adopted certain technical requirements for the expanded unlicensed use within our licensed spectrum which should protect our services from harmful interference. We can provide no assurances that such requirements will be adhered to by unlicensed users or whether such requirements will actually prevent harmful interference to our services. Further, other regulatory jurisdictions internationally may also consider similar expanded unlicensed use in the 5 GHz band that may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to provide mobile satellite services.\nIf the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend our licenses, our ability to operate will be harmed or eliminated.\nWe hold FCC licenses for the operation of certain of our satellites, our U.S. gateways and other ground facilities, and our mobile earth terminals that are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy specified conditions or to meet prescribed milestones. The FCC licenses are also subject to modification by the FCC. There can be no assurance that the FCC will renew the FCC licenses we hold. If the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend the FCC licenses we hold, or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective FCC licenses, we may not be able to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services.\nIf our French regulator revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend our licenses, our ability to operate will be harmed or eliminated.\nWe hold licenses issued by, and are subject to the continued regulatory jurisdiction of, the French Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment and ARCEP, the French independent administrative authority of post and electronic communications regulations, for the operation of our second-generation satellites. These licenses are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy specified conditions or to meet prescribed milestones. These licenses are also subject to modification by the French regulators. There can be no assurance that the French regulators will renew the licenses we hold. If the French regulators revoke, modify or fail to renew or amend the licenses we hold, or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective French licenses, we may not be able to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services.\nSimilarly, we hold certain licenses in each country within which we have ground infrastructure located. If we fail to maintain such licenses within any particular country, we may not be able to continue to operate the ground infrastructure located within that country which could prevent us from continuing to provide mobile satellite communications services within that region.\nSpectrum values historically have been volatile, which could cause the value of our business to fluctuate.\nOur business plan includes forming strategic partnerships to maximize the use and value of our spectrum, network assets and combined service offerings in the United States and internationally. Value that we may be able to realize from such partnerships will depend in part on the value ascribed to our spectrum. Historically, valuations of spectrum in other frequency bands have been volatile, and we cannot predict the future value that we may be able to realize for our spectrum and other assets. In addition, to the extent that the FCC takes action that makes additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater availability (e.g., via spectrum leasing or new spectrum sales) of existing satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, the availability of such additional spectrum could reduce the value that we may be able to realize for our spectrum.\nChanges in international trade regulations and other risks associated with foreign trade could adversely affect our sourcing.\nWe source our products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. The adoption of regulations related to the importation of product, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported goods, and changes in U.S. customs procedures could result in an increase in the cost of our products. Delays in customs clearance of goods or the disruption of international transportation lines used by us could result in our inability to deliver goods to customers in a timely manner or the potential loss of sales altogether. Current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues, such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products, could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production or increase our costs. Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT but could be delisted in the future, which may impair our ability to raise capital and would require us to repurchase our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our voting common stock was listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \u201cGSAT.\u201d Broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell and/or make a market in our common stock if delisting were to occur, which may make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock. Removal of our common stock from listing on the NYSE MKT may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of our securities.\nIf our common stock is not listed on a U.S. national stock exchange or approved for quotation and trading on a national automated dealer quotation system or established automated over-the-counter trading market, holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 will have the option to require us to repurchase the notes, which we may not have sufficient financial resources to do.\nRestrictive covenants in our Facility Agreement do not allow us to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Our Facility Agreement currently prohibits the payment of cash dividends. Any future dividend payments are within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and there is a limited market for our shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure in the performance of our current or future satellites;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by research analysts, or any failure by us to meet or exceed any such estimates, or changes in the recommendations of any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock or the common stock of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in economic, political or market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment affecting our industry, including final rulemaking by the FCC related to our TLPS proceeding;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated sales of common stock by our controlling stockholder or others;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of our industry peers; and\n\u2022\nannouncement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives.\nThe trading price of our common stock may also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the initial purchase price. Additionally, because we are a controlled company there is a limited market for our common stock, and we cannot assure our stockholders that a trading market will develop further or be maintained. In periods of low trading volume, sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our stock.\nThe future issuance of additional shares of our common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our current stockholders. We are authorized to issue 1.6 billion shares of common stock (400 million are designated as nonvoting) and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 904.4 million shares of voting common stock and 134.0 million shares of nonvoting common stock were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2015, there were 661.5 million shares available for future issuance, of which approximately 181.6 million shares were contingently issuable upon the exercise of warrants, stock options, or convertible notes, the vesting of restricted stock awards, and as consideration for other liabilities. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock for capital raising or other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe have issued and may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of our common stock. Currently, there are 100 million shares of preferred stock authorized; during 2009 one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was issued and subsequently converted to shares of voting and nonvoting common stock. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than holders of our common stock.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. Holders of our securities could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock. In 2014, our stock was the subject of aggressive short selling by a hedge fund. As a result, the market price of our common stock fell 25% from September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Facility Agreement and Delaware corporate law may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and convertible notes.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our Facility Agreement and indenture could hamper a third party's acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting rights or with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three separate classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our stockholders, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, to remove our directors only for cause and only by the vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibitions, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, on our stockholders acting by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibitions on our stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders or filling vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, that our stockholders must obtain a super-majority vote to amend or repeal our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions in our Facility Agreement, which provide that a change of control will constitute an event of default and, unless waived by the lenders, will result in the acceleration of the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement;\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions relating to our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, which provide that a change of control will permit holders of the notes to demand immediate repayment; and\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions in our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, which provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.\nWe also are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision does not apply to Thermo, which became our principal stockholder prior to our initial public offering.\nThese provisions also could make it more difficult for you and our other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are controlled by Thermo, whose interests may conflict with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Thermo owned approximately 54% of our outstanding voting common stock and approximately 60% of all outstanding common stock. Additionally, Thermo owns warrants that may be converted into or exercised for additional shares of common stock. Thermo is able to control the election of all of the members of our board of directors and the vote on substantially all other matters, including significant corporate transactions such as the approval of a merger or other transaction involving our sale.\nWe have depended substantially on Thermo to provide capital to finance our business. In 2006 and 2007, Thermo purchased an aggregate of $200 million of common stock at prices substantially above market. On December 17, 2007, Thermo assumed all of the obligations and was assigned all of the rights (other than indemnification rights) of the administrative agent and the lenders under our amended and restated credit agreement. To fulfill the conditions precedent to our Facility Agreement, in 2009, Thermo converted the loans outstanding under the credit agreement into equity and terminated the credit agreement. In addition, Thermo and its affiliates deposited $60.0 million in a contingent equity account to fulfill a condition precedent for borrowing under the Facility Agreement, purchased $20.0 million of our 5.0% Notes, which were subsequently converted into shares of common stock in 2013, purchased $11.4 million of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, loaned us $37.5 million to fund our debt service reserve account under the Facility Agreement, and funded a total of $65.0 million during 2013 pursuant to the terms of the Consent Agreement, the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. Additionally, in August 2015, we entered into an equity agreement with Thermo in which Thermo agreed to purchase up to $30.0 million of our equity securities if we so request or if an event of default is continuing under the Facility Agreement and funds are not available under our common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin. Thermo's remaining cash equity commitment under the Equity Agreement was $15.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThermo is controlled by James Monroe III, our Chairman and CEO. Through Thermo, Mr. Monroe holds equity interests in, and serves as an executive officer or director of, a diverse group of privately-owned businesses not otherwise related to us. We reimburse Thermo and Mr. Monroe for certain third party, documented, out of pocket expenses they incur in connection with our business.\nThe interests of Thermo may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Thermo may take actions it believes will benefit its equity investment in us or loans to us even though such actions might not be in your best interests as a holder of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91612, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GSAT"}
