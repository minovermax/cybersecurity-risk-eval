{"cik": "12659", "company": "H&R BLOCK INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring, and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors, acting as a whole and through its committees, take an active role in our risk management process\nand have delegated certain activities related to the oversight of risk management to the Company's enterprise risk management team and the Enterprise Risk Committee, which is comprised of Vice Presidents of major business and control functions and members of the Enterprise Risk Management team. The Company\u2019s enterprise risk management team, working in coordination with the Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and related mitigation and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices.\nAn investment in our securities involves risk, including the risk that the value of that investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management's control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and the value of an investment in our securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and may be impacted by a resurgence of COVID-19 or a future outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease.\nDuring March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. To date, this outbreak, which has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, including all jurisdictions where the Company operates, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, have caused and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and disruption in the financial markets. Globally, governments have taken a variety of actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, business closure orders, shelter-in-place orders, or other similar measures.\nIn the U.S., state, county, and municipal jurisdictions in which we operate issued, and continue to issue, a high volume of emergency orders intended to contain the spread of COVID-19, which imposed various restrictions on our business, including capacity and other operational limitations, social distancing requirements, and in limited instances required us to close certain offices. The requirements of the various emergency orders often differ and, even where similar, may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current or future operations, policies, and practices may be determined to be inconsistent with those requirements, interpretations, or applications in certain jurisdictions.\nWe took a variety of actions to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including implementing our crisis response process, initiating other efforts to facilitate compliance with the various emergency orders (while maintaining continuity of operations as much as practicable), and implementing certain initiatives designed to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19 and to meet the health and safety needs of our clients, associates, and franchisees. Though we were able to continue to provide a reduced number of in-person appointments, in late March 2020 we implemented operational changes across our U.S. assisted locations to increase the number of clients who drop off their documents and approve online. While this allowed clients to obtain professional assisted tax preparation from a tax office with minimal in-person interactions, these changes, along with the extension of the tax season described below, adversely impacted the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020.\nNotwithstanding the above-described efforts and our attempts to comply with COVID-19-related requirements, there is no certainty that we will be able to consistently do so or that the measures we have implemented, or implement in the future, will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus. Alleged failures in this regard could result in additional negative impacts, including regulatory investigations, claims, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including COVID-19 orders that continue for indefinite periods, modifications to orders resulting in more stringent requirements, or increased regulations regarding workplace conditions and benefits. Establishing systems and processes, or making changes to our existing policies, to achieve compliance with any of these, or other, complex and evolving requirements may increase our costs or restrict our business operations. In addition, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to predict how the demand for our services will be affected. It is unclear how quickly or if clients will\nreturn to our offices to file during the remainder of tax season 2020 and in future years, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety or a permanent shift by consumers to DIY or virtual tax preparation methods. We may make changes in our operations to react to, or in anticipation of, such a shift in consumer behaviors, but such changes may not be successful in retaining current clients or attracting new clients to our brand.\nThe further spread of COVID-19 or a new global or national outbreak, the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of illness, and the other risks described above may further impact our ability to carry out our business and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in credit markets due to COVID-19 or otherwise, by downgraded credit ratings, or by our failure to meet certain covenants. Our funding costs could increase, further impacting earnings.\nWe need liquidity to meet our working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for general corporate purposes. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of credit rating downgrades, or due to our failure to meet financial covenants. On March 26, 2020, we drew down the full $2.0 billion available under our CLOC to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the amount borrowed under the CLOC led to increased interest expense for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, which will remain elevated until such amounts are repaid. In addition, $650 million in principal of our Senior Notes are due in October 2020. Additional events may occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels. We may need to obtain additional sources of funding to meet these liquidity needs, which may not be available or may only be available under unfavorable terms. In addition, if rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt under our existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements, could increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable.\nOur CLOC is subject to various covenants, and, as of April 30, 2020, we were not in compliance with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio covenant due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Though the lenders under the CLOC waived non-compliance with this covenant as of April 30, 2020, there is no guarantee that they would waive any future covenant violations. If we violate this or other covenants in the CLOC in the future and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the CLOC would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. An acceleration of the indebtedness under the CLOC would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets remain unknown. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be available or may only be available under less favorable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in applicable tax laws have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on the demand for and pricing of our services, adversely affecting our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe U.S. government has in the past made, and may in the future make, changes to the individual income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, tax regulations, and the rules and procedures for implementing such laws and regulations. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may change the income tax laws in their respective jurisdictions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 21, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the IRS announced that the federal tax filing deadline for individual 2019 tax returns was extended from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020, and substantially all U.S. states with an April 15 individual state income tax filing requirement extended their respective deadlines. In Canada, the deadline for individuals to file was extended to June 1, 2020. These delays negatively impacted the demand for our services in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, resulting in a substantial decrease in the number of tax returns prepared by or through H&R Block, impacting our revenue, cash flows, and earnings for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. Treasury, the IRS, and state or foreign officials may determine to further extend tax deadlines or take other actions, which could have\nan additional material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in future years.\nIt is difficult to predict the manner in which future changes to the Internal Revenue Code, tax regulations, and the rules and procedures for implementing such laws and regulations, and state, local, and foreign tax laws may impact us and the tax return preparation industry. Such future changes could decrease the demand or the amount we charge for our services, and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThere are various other initiatives from time to time seeking to modify the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise simplify tax return preparation. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also introduced measures seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, or otherwise reduce the need for third-party tax return preparation services could reduce demand for our services and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased competition for tax preparation and small business clients could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free services or products could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe provide assisted, DIY, and virtual tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. All categories in the tax return preparation industry are highly competitive and additional competitors have entered, and in the future may enter, the market to provide tax preparation services or products. In the assisted tax services category, there are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Commercial tax return preparers are highly competitive with regard to price and service. In the DIY and virtual categories, options include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications, and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our DIY and virtual services and products compete with a number of online and software companies, primarily on price and functionality. Individual tax filers may elect to change their tax preparation method, choosing from among various assisted, DIY, and virtual offerings, and technology increasingly makes switching among tax preparers and tax preparation methods easier for those consumers. In addition, as discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the number of taxpayers switching from assisted tax preparation to DIY or virtual methods.\nTechnology advances quickly and in new and unexpected ways, and it is difficult to predict the manner in which these changes will impact the tax return preparation industry, the problems we may encounter in enhancing our services and products or the time and resources we may need to devote to the creation, support, and maintenance of technological enhancements. If we are slow to enhance our services, products, or technologies, if our competitors are able to achieve results more quickly than us, or if there are new and unexpected entrants into the industry, we may fail to capture, or lose, a significant share of the market.\nAdditionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms compete by offering one or more of RTs, prepaid cards, RAs, other financial services and products, and other tax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks. We can make no assurances that we will be able to offer, or continue to offer, all of these services and products and a failure to do so could negatively impact our financial results and ability to compete. Intense competition could result in a reduction of our market share, lower revenues, lower margins, and lower profitability. In addition, Wave faces intense competition with its small business financial solutions. Wave may be unsuccessful in competing with other providers, which may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.\nU.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge, and certain volunteer organizations also prepare tax returns at no charge for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our competitors offer certain tax preparation services and products, and other financial services and products, at no charge. In order to compete, we have offered certain, and may in the future offer additional, services and products at no charge. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively ensure the migration of clients from our free offerings to those for which we receive fees, and clients who have formerly paid for our offerings\nmay elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, or harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.\nGovernment tax authorities, volunteer organizations, our competitors, and potential new market entrants may also elect to implement or expand free offerings in the future. Free File, Inc., which operates under an agreement that expires in October 2021, is currently the sole means through which the IRS offers DIY tax software to taxpayers, however the IRS is not prohibited from offering competing services. In addition, from time to time, U.S. federal and state governments have considered various proposals through which the respective governmental taxing authorities would use taxpayer information provided by employers, financial institutions, and other payers to \"pre-populate,\" prepare and calculate tax returns and distribute them to taxpayers. Under this approach, the taxpayer could then review and contest the return or sign and return it, reducing the need for third-party tax return preparation services and the demand for our services and products. There are various initiatives from time to time seeking to expedite refunds, which could reduce the demand for RTs. In addition, the IRS has in the past explored the possibility of allowing taxpayers to allocate a portion of their tax refunds to pay tax preparation fees, but the IRS has not advanced this initiative.\nWe believe that governmental encroachment at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as comparable government levels in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nCompliance with the complex and evolving laws, regulations, standards, and contractual requirements regarding privacy and data protection could require changes in our business practices and increase costs of operation; failure to comply could result in significant claims, fines, penalties, and damages.\nIn the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information and data from our clients, including tax return information, financial product and service information, and social security numbers. In addition, we collect, use, and retain personal information and data of our employees in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of such consumer and employee personal information, which have drawn increased attention from U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires a tax return preparer to obtain the prior written consent of the taxpayer to use or disclose the taxpayer's information for certain purposes other than tax return preparation, which may limit our ability to market revenue-generating products to our clients. In addition, other regulations require financial institutions to adopt and disclose their consumer privacy notice and generally provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to \"opt-out\" of having nonpublic personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties.\nNumerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer or employee information and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. For example, the State of California adopted the CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020. Subject to certain exceptions, the CCPA imposes new requirements on how businesses collect, process, manage, and retain certain personal information of California residents and provides California residents with various rights regarding personal information collected by a business. Several other states have proposed and may adopt their own, different privacy laws. These laws may contain different requirements or may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current privacy and data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those requirements, interpretations, or applications. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state regulatory requirements, as well as requirements imposed by governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in more stringent requirements and in a need to change business practices, including the types of information we can use and the manner in which we can use such information. Establishing systems and processes, or making changes to our existing policies, to achieve compliance with these complex and evolving requirements may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully comply in all cases, which could result in regulatory investigations, claims, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nA security breach of our systems, or third-party systems on which we rely, resulting in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information, may adversely affect the demand for our services and products, our reputation, and financial performance.\nWe offer a range of services and products to our clients, including assisted, DIY, and virtual tax return preparation solutions, financial services and products, and small business financial solutions through our company-owned or franchise offices and online through Wave. Due to the nature of these services and products, we use multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit, and store high volumes of client personal information. We also collect, use, and retain other sensitive, nonpublic information, such as employee social security numbers, healthcare information, and payroll information, as well as confidential, nonpublic business information. Certain third parties and vendors have access to personal information to help deliver client benefits, services and products, or may host certain of our and our clients\u2019 sensitive and personal information and data. Information security risks continue to increase due in part to the increased adoption of and reliance upon digital technologies by companies and consumers. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to a variety of factors including, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and related regulation, the increased activity and sophistication of nation states, organized crime, cyber criminals, and hackers, the prominence of our brand, our and our franchisees' extensive office footprint, our plans to continue to implement strategies for our online and mobile applications and our desktop software, our use of third-party vendors, and the increasing usage of remote working arrangements by our associates, franchisees, and third-party vendors, which has significantly expanded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCybersecurity risks may result from fraud or malice (a cyberattack), human error, or accidental technological failure. Cyberattacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal information, disrupting our ability to offer services, damaging our brand and reputation, stealing our intellectual property, or advancing social or political agendas. We face a variety of cyberattack threats including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and other sophisticated attacks.\nAlthough we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information and expend significant resources to maintain multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate the risk of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We regularly test our systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, and we rely on training and testing of our employees regarding heightened phishing and social engineering threats. We also conduct certain background checks on our employees, as allowed by law, and limit access to systems and data. Due to the structure of our business model, we also rely on our franchisees and other private and governmental third parties to maintain secure systems and respond to cybersecurity risks. Where appropriate, we impose certain requirements and controls on these third parties, but it is possible that they may not appropriately employ these controls or that such controls (or their own separate requirements and controls) may be insufficient to protect personal information. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As risks and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, become more sophisticated, and are often difficult to detect until after a successful attack, causing us to be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in all cases. Although we generally seek to maintain insurance from time to time that might mitigate some of our damages in the event of a significant security breach or cyberattack, we would still be exposed to damages in the amounts of our deductibles, retentions, and for losses outside of the scope of our policies (e.g., reputational harm). Furthermore, insurance against cybersecurity risks may cease to be available to us in the future or the pricing of such insurance may be prohibitively expensive.\nA breach of our security measures or those of our franchisees or third parties on whom we rely, or other fraudulent activity, could result in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information. If such an event were to occur, it could have serious short- and long-term negative\nconsequences. Unauthorized access to personal information could cause us to determine that it is required or advisable for us to notify affected individuals, regulators, or others under applicable privacy laws and regulations. Security breach remediation could also require us to expend significant resources to assist impacted individuals, repair damaged systems, implement modified information security measures, and maintain client and business relationships. Other consequences could include reduced client demand for our services and products, loss of valuable intellectual property, reduced growth and profitability and negative impacts to future financial results, loss of our ability to deliver one or more services or products (e.g., inability to provide financial services and products or to accept and process client credit card transactions or tax returns), modifying or stopping existing business practices, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages, and further regulation and oversight by U.S. federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities.\nA security breach or other unauthorized access to our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIdentity theft or other fraud that impedes our clients' ability to file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our services and products, resulting in negative publicity.\nA person with malicious intent could obtain user account and password information from our clients through hacking, phishing, or other means of cyberattack, in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns through our systems. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process and offer our TIS product to help protect clients, stolen identity refund fraud or other fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our services and products, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems.\nFederal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may in the future take additional action, in an attempt to combat identity theft or other fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices, that we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA number of companies, including some in the tax return preparation industry, have reported instances where criminals gained unauthorized and illegal access to consumer information or user accounts maintained on their systems by using stolen identity information (e.g., email, username, password information, or credit history) obtained from third-party sources. We have experienced, and in the future may continue to experience, this form of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. Such events could negatively impact our clients and harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation. Additionally, if such unauthorized or illegal access occurs, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, non-clients, or governmental agencies.\nAn interruption in our information systems, or those of our franchisees or a third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe, our franchisees, and other third parties involved in our business operations rely heavily upon communications, networks, and information systems and the internet to conduct our business, including third-party internet-based or cloud computing services. These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks (e.g., through computer viruses and worms, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, information security breaches, or other negative disruptions to the operation of the internet), human error, and natural disasters. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during our peak periods. Therefore, any failure or interruption in our information systems, or information systems of our franchisees or a private or government third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet or other critical business capability, could negatively impact our business operations and reputation, and increase our risk of loss.\nThere can be no assurance that system or internet failures or interruptions in critical business capabilities will not occur, or, if they do occur, that we, our franchisees or the private or governmental third parties on whom we rely, will\nadequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions or failures may not be adequate in all circumstances, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems or other critical business capabilities. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Our software and computer systems utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by Microsoft Corporation. If the Microsoft Azure Cloud is unavailable for any reason, it could negatively impact our ability to deliver our services and products and our clients may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, any of which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.\nThe occurrence of any systems or internet failure, or business interruption could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws and expanded the role of state regulators with respect to consumer protection laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB or other regulators may affect our financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services, and contracts.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB and gave it broad powers to administer, investigate compliance with, and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of financial consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive, or abusive\" acts and practices.\nThe CFPB and state regulators may examine, investigate, and take enforcement actions against our subsidiaries that provide consumer financial services and products, as well as financial institutions and service providers upon which our subsidiaries rely to provide consumer financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the role of state regulators in enforcing and promulgating financial consumer protection laws, the results of which could be (i) states issuing new and broader financial consumer protection laws, some of which could be more comprehensive than existing U.S. federal regulations, or (ii) state attorneys general bringing actions to enforce federal consumer protection laws in the absence of CFPB action.\nCurrently proposed or new CFPB and state regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.\nTax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online and mobile applications and desktop software. The unpredictable nature, timing and effective dates of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline and, in turn, receive any tax refund amounts on a timely basis. In addition, governmental authorities regularly change their processes for accepting tax filings and related tax forms. Further, changes in governmental administrations or regulations could result in a delay of the start of the tax season or in further and unanticipated changes in requirements or processes. New or changed governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services and products to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. Furthermore, unanticipated changes in governmental processes, or newly implemented processes, for (1) accepting tax filings and related forms, including the ability of taxing authorities to accept electronic tax return filings, or (2) distributing tax refunds or other amounts to clients may result in delays in our processing of our clients' tax filings, or delays in tax authorities accepting electronic tax return filings, and, in turn, delay any tax refund or other amounts to which such clients may be entitled. From time to time, we review and enhance our quality controls for preparing accurate tax returns, but there can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to prevent all inaccuracies. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.\nIf we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our systems, services or products, we may elect to delay or suspend our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays, or unanticipated changes in governmental processes, or newly implemented processes, for (1) accepting tax filings and related forms, or (2) distributing tax refunds or other amounts to clients may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, a deterioration in our business relationships with our franchisees, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, exposure to litigation, and increased operating expenses, even if any such launch delays or defects are not caused by us. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy and data security, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, consumer financial services and products, restrictive covenants, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.\nWe rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nHistorically, we have contracted, and in the future we will likely continue to contract, with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products for our tax, financial, and other services and products. A few examples of this type of reliance are our relationships with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), for data processing and card production services, our banking partner, for the issuance of RTs, EAs, RAs and Emerald Cards, and Microsoft Corporation, for cloud computing services. In certain instances, we are vulnerable to vendor error, service inefficiencies, service interruptions, or service delays. Our sensitivity to any of these issues may be heightened (1) due to the seasonality of our business, (2) with respect to any vendor that we utilize for the provision of any product or service that has specialized expertise, (3) with respect to any vendor that is a sole or exclusive provider, or (4) with respect to any vendor whose indemnification obligations are limited or that does not have the financial capacity to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Some of our vendors are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and, as a result, our product or service offerings may be affected by the actions or decisions of such regulatory bodies. Vendor failures could occur in various ways including (1) vendor error, (2) inability to meet our needs in a timely manner, or (3) termination or delay in the services or products provided by a vendor because the vendor fails to perform adequately, is no longer in business, experiences shortages, or discontinues a certain product or service that we utilize. If our vendors are unable to meet our needs and we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe specialized and highly seasonal nature of our business presents financial risks and operational and human capital challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could materially affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue generally earned in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a\nnumber of challenges for us, including (1) cash and resource management during the first nine months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, (2) ensuring compliance with financial covenants under our CLOC, particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from this seasonal period, (3) responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, (4) disruptions in a tax season, including any pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which may disproportionately affect us compared to other companies if they occur during our fiscal fourth quarter, (5) client dissatisfaction issues or negative social media campaigns, which may not be timely discovered or satisfactorily addressed, and (6) ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, we could experience a loss, disruption, or change in timing of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel in a timely manner, including members of our executive team and those in seasonal tax preparation positions or with other required specialized expertise, including technical positions. The market for such personnel is extremely competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the required personnel within necessary timeframes. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel, our business, operations, and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted or implemented that impact our seasonal workforce and increase our labor costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face legal actions in connection with our various business activities, and current or future legal actions may damage our reputation, impair our product offerings, or result in material liabilities and losses.\nWe have been named, and from time to time will likely continue to be named, in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by state attorneys general and other regulators, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities, including relating to our various service and product offerings. For example, we are subject to litigation and have received and are responding to certain governmental inquiries relating to the IRS Free File program. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. We also grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered trademarks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be alleged to be controlled by us. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. Adverse outcomes related to legal actions could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our or our franchisees' actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nThe continued payment of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock are dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.\nWe need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. Even if we have sufficient resources to pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, the Board of Directors may determine to use such resources to fund other Company initiatives. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid, or future repurchases will be made, at levels comparable to our historical practices, if at all. In addition, payments of dividends negatively impact net worth. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that our business is not asset-intensive, we have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative net worth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at various times throughout the year. Therefore, the payment of dividends or stock repurchases at such times would cause us to further increase that GAAP negative net worth.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and high unemployment levels, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiven that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown, it appears increasingly likely that it could cause a global recession, which could be of an unknown duration. Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased levels of unemployment globally, which may be sustained. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services and products. In the event of difficult economic conditions that include high unemployment levels, especially within the client segments we serve, clients may elect not to file tax returns or utilize lower cost preparation and filing alternatives.\nIn addition, difficult economic conditions may disproportionately impact small business owners. Wave\u2019s revenues have been negatively impacted, and may continue to be negatively impacted if there is a sustained economic slowdown or recession as a result of the pandemic. Difficult economic conditions, including an economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and products and is an important element in attracting new clients. In addition, our franchisees may operate their businesses under our brands. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities involving or attributed to us, our franchisees, employees, or agents or our services or products, which may be enhanced due to the nature of social media, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack, other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties, or human error. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIn addition, third parties may allege we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes and, in that event, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant royalty or technology development expenses, suffer harm to our reputation, or pay significant monetary damages.\nFailure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our ongoing operations. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur international operations are subject to risks which may harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have international operations, including tax preparation businesses in Canada and Australia, technology centers in India and Ireland, and Wave in Canada. We may consider expansion opportunities in additional countries in the\nfuture and there is uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from new or emerging foreign operations and expand into other international markets. Additionally, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: (1) changes in trade regulations; (2) difficulties in managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; (3) profit repatriation restrictions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism, and economic and political instability; (5) compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we prepare U.S. federal and state tax returns for taxpayers residing in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), and we operate and have franchisees who operate in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, certain aspects of our operations are subject, or may in the future become subject, to the laws, regulations, and policies of those jurisdictions that regulate the collection, use, and transfer of personal information, which may be more stringent than those of the U.S. For example, in May 2018, the EU implemented a privacy and data protection regulation, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation.\nCosts for us to comply with such laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us could be significant. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to these laws, regulations, and policies that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations, or in the interpretations of tax laws or regulations, could materially affect our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. The amount of tax due in various jurisdictions may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control, including changes to tax laws or new interpretations of existing laws that are inconsistent with previous interpretations or positions taken by taxing authorities on which we have relied. For example, in 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Given the lack of regulatory guidance regarding the Tax Legislation, regulatory interpretations that differ from our existing interpretations of the Tax Legislation could materially affect our effective tax rates or value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. More recently, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes, among other items, provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of certain tax payments, and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations. We are currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act and expect additional regulations, interpretations, and rulings may be forthcoming that could further impact our consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate may propose additional changes to their tax rules in response to COVID-19. The impact of these potential new rules could be material.\nIn addition, projects undertaken by international organizations may change international tax norms relating to each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade. Given the unpredictability of these and other possible changes to tax laws and related regulations, it is difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential changes, but any such changes could, if adopted and applicable to us, adversely impact our effective tax rates and other tax liabilities.\nOur tax returns and other tax matters are periodically examined by tax authorities and governmental bodies, including the IRS, which may disagree with positions taken by us in determining our tax liability. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.\nIf our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nSand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) is subject to litigation and other claims, including potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated, which may result in significant financial losses.\nAlthough SCC ceased its mortgage loan origination activities in December 2007 and sold its loan servicing business in April 2008, SCC has been, remains, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, claims, including indemnification and contribution claims, and other loss contingencies pertaining to SCC's mortgage business activities that occurred prior to such termination and sale. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of litigation and other claims to which SCC may be subject.\nBetween January 2005 and November 2007, SCC originated mortgage loans totaling approximately $80 billion. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers, who generally securitized such loans, or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). SCC estimates approximately 90% of the loans it originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were securitized in approximately 110 securitization transactions.\nIn connection with the sale of loans or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. Claims under these representations and warranties together with any settlement arrangements related to these losses are collectively referred to as \"representation and warranty claims.\"\nThe statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE), that the six-year statute of limitations under New York law starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. This decision applies to claims and lawsuits brought against SCC where New York law governs. New York law governs many, though not all, of the transactions into which SCC entered. However, this decision would not affect representation and warranty claims and lawsuits SCC has received or may receive, for example, where the statute of limitations has been tolled by agreement or a suit was timely filed.\nIn response to the statute of limitations rulings in the ACE case and similar rulings in other state and federal courts, parties seeking to pursue representation and warranty claims or lawsuits have sought, and may in the future seek, to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision, pursue alternate legal theories of recovery, or assert claims against other contractual parties such as securitization trustees.\nFor example, a 2016 ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court, followed by the federal district court in the second Homeward case described in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on additional loans in the same trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. Additionally, plaintiffs in litigation to which SCC is not party have alleged breaches of an independent contractual duty to provide notice of material breaches of representations and warranties and pursued separate claims to which, they argue, the statute of limitations ruling in the ACE case does not apply. The impact on SCC from alternative legal theories seeking to avoid or distinguish the ACE decision, or judicial limitations on the ACE decision, is unclear.\nIn most of the securitization transactions in which SCC participated, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify contracting parties, including underwriters, depositors, or securitization trustees for certain losses and expenses that such parties may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses they may incur in their defense of such claims.\nSome underwriters, depositors, and securitization trustees are, or have been, defendants in lawsuits, threatened lawsuits, and settlements related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. A variety of claims are alleged in these matters, including violations of U.S. federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, that originators, depositors, securitization trustees, servicers, or other parties breached their representations and warranties or otherwise failed to fulfill their obligations, or that securitization trustees violated statutory requirements by failing to properly protect the certificate holders\u2019 interests. SCC has received notices of claims for indemnification or potential indemnification obligations relating to such matters. Certain of the notices received included, and future notices may include, a reservation of rights to assert claims for\ncontribution, which are referred to herein as \"contribution claims.\" Contribution claims may become operative if indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to cover all of the losses and expenses involved. These indemnification and contribution claims are frequently not subject to a contractual term or limit. Additional lawsuits against parties to the securitization transactions may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of claims for indemnification, contribution, or similar obligations with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits or other claims.\nIn addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification or contribution claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including U.S. federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract claims, among others. Additional or new lawsuits or claims may be filed or asserted against SCC in the future.\nWe have not concluded that a loss related to these matters is probable, nor have we accrued a liability for these claims as of April 30, 2020. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nH&R Block guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.\nSCC has been subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees, and subsequent purchasers of whole loans. In certain limited circumstances, H&R Block guaranteed payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.\nIn addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC's servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (closing occurred in 2008).\nWe could be subject to claims by the creditors of SCC.\nAs discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims, indemnification and contribution claims, and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. Additional claims and litigation may be asserted in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation, together with related administration and legal expense, exceeds its net assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to assert claims or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of April 30, 2020, total approximately $276 million and consist of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor.", "PERMNO": 49373, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "HRB"}
