Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class B common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class B common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our business, financial condition or operating results to be harmed, including, but not limited to, risks regarding the following:\nRisks Related to our Businesses and Operations\n\u25cf errors in our technology or technological issues outside our control;\n\u25cf cyberattacks impacting our networks or systems;\n\u25cf network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers;\n\u25cf the failure, or perceived failure, of one or more of our products;\n\u25cf our international operations subject us to geopolitical and other risks including ongoing developments in Belarus and Ukraine;\n\u25cf failures in our data center or services;\n\u25cf our dependence on industry standard protocols and third-party software, including but not limited to open-source software;\n\u25cf our dependence on a single supplier or small group of suppliers;\n\u25cf changes to rates by our suppliers and increasing regulatory charges or tariffs;\n\u25cf our customers, particularly our IDT Global customers, could experience financial difficulties;\n\u25cf technologies could affect our ability to track the results of ads and/or could block ads online;\n\u25cf the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith;\nRisks Related to Our NRS Business\n\u25cf the ability of NRS to develop products and services to address the market for POS products and services;\n\u25cf substantial and increasingly intense competition in the POS industry;\n\u25cf advertising on the NRS platform;\nRisks Related to Our net2phone Business\n\u25cf competition against established well-financed alternative voice communication providers, who may provide comparable services at comparable or lower pricing;\n\u25cf the capacity, reliability, and performance of several third-party providers and their network infrastructure;\n\u25cf scaling the business efficiently or quickly enough to meet its customers\u2019 growing needs;\n\u25cf the acquisition of Integra\u2019s CCaaS business;\nRisks Related to Our Traditional Communications Business\n\u25cf each of our BOSS Revolution Calling and IDT Global businesses is highly sensitive to declining prices;\n\u25cf obtaining sufficient or cost-effective termination capacity to particular destinations;\n\u25cf the termination of our carrier agreements with partners or our inability to enter into carrier agreements in the future;\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\n\u25cf we hold cash, cash equivalents, debt securities and equity investments that are subject to various market risks;\n\u25cf if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results;\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\n\u25cf protecting our proprietary technology;\n\u25cf claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf tax and regulatory audits;\n\u25cf legal proceedings;\n\u25cf our and our disbursement partners\u2019 and our payment processors\u2019 ability to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent illegal or illicit activity;\n\u25cf licensing and other requirements imposed by regulators and governments;\n\u25cf our collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of personal data;\n\u25cf collection of sales and use, value added, or similar taxes;\n\u25cf certain imminent FCC Orders and rules that effect the telecommunications marketplace;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with requirements for debit card, credit card, and other digital payment methods;\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\n\u25cf holders of our Class B common stock have significantly less voting power than holders of our Class A common stock; and\n\u25cf eight trusts for the benefit of sons and daughters of Howard S. Jonas, our Chairman and Chairman of the Board, hold shares that, in the aggregate, represent more than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses and Operations\nErrors in our technology or technological issues outside our control could cause delays or interruptions to our customers.\nOur services can be disrupted by issues with our networks, platforms, technology, and systems, including malfunctions in our servers, processors, software or facilities. In addition, there may be service interruptions for reasons outside of our control. Our customers and potential customers subscribing to our services have experienced such interruptions in the past and may experience such interruptions in the future as a result of these types of problems or others which may or may not be in our control. Such interruptions may cause us to lose customers and/or offer customer credits, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Network and telecommunication interruptions may also impair our ability to sign-up new customers.\nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyberattacks, including through the use of malware, ransomware, computer viruses, denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyberattacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers\u2019 operations. Furthermore, ransomware could potentially deny the use of our systems until a ransom is paid. Cyberattacks against companies, including us, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a cyberattack in the future.\nThe inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyberattacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to us and/or a loss of market share. The costs associated with a major cyberattack on us could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of our businesses, such as those offering cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyberattack. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.\nWe could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nTo be successful, we need to continue to have available, for our and our customers\u2019 use, a high capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses, sabotage, or other significant disruption of our IT infrastructure. As such, there is a risk of a security breach or disruption of the systems we operate, including possible unauthorized access to our and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information. We are also subject to breaches of our respective networks resulting in unauthorized utilization of our services or products, which subject us to the costs of providing those products or services, which are likely not recoverable. The secure maintenance and transmission of our and our customers\u2019 information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our or our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our or our customers\u2019 consent, or our product and service may be used without payment.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our respective security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions sponsored by state or other interests. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. Certain of our business units have been the subject of attempted and successful cyber-attacks in the past. We have researched the situations and do not believe any material internal, or customer information has been compromised.\nNetwork disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized use of our services or products without payment; (iii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; and (iv) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems and processes. We could be subject to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, fines, penalties, termination, or other remedies from our customers, and subject to additional scrutiny or litigation by regulators, as a result of network disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems, any or all of which could result in a loss of business, damage to our reputation among our customers and the public generally and have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIf one or more of our products fail, or is perceived to fail, or if there are technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline, and we could be subject to various liability claims.\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in failures or otherwise cause our products to fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations and contractual obligations. Moreover, our customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our products, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm the perceived utility of our products and our brand. Because our customers use our products for mission-critical aspects of their business, any real or perceived errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our products may damage our customers\u2019 businesses and could significantly harm our reputation. If that occurs, we could lose future sales, or our existing customers could cancel our services, seek payment credits, seek damages against us, or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in service credits that reduce our revenues, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts, and ultimately harm our financial results. Product performance problems could result in loss of market share, reputational harm, failure to achieve market acceptance and the diversion of development resources.\nIn addition, since telecommunications billing and associated telecom taxes, and the related calculations and billing of telecom taxes, are inherently complex and require highly sophisticated information systems to administer, our billing system may experience errors or we may improperly operate the system, which could result in the system incorrectly calculating the fees owed by our customers or related taxes and administrative fees. Customers also may make indemnification or warranty claims against us, which could result in significant expense and risk of litigation.\nAny product liability, intellectual property, warranty or other claims against us could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant settlements or damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims. Also, our insurers may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. Any contract or product liability claims successfully brought against us would harm our business.\nOur revenues and profits will suffer if our distributors and sales representatives fail to effectively market and distribute our products and services.\nWe rely on our distributors and representatives to market and distribute our BOSS Revolution products and services, Mobile Top-Up, and NRS\u2019 POS terminals and portfolio of services. We utilize a network of several hundred sub-distributors that sell our BOSS Revolution products and services and our Mobile Top-Up offerings to retail outlets throughout most of the United States. NRS\u2019 POS terminal sales and marketing efforts are targeted, in part, to our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution retailers. If our distributors or sales representatives fail to effectively market or distribute our products and services, our ability to generate revenues and profits and grow our customer base in these products and services could be substantially impaired.\nOur global operations subject us to geopolitical and other risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have developers, product development personnel, other employees and senior management in different countries, and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas. As a result, our ability to design, develop or sell products and services may be affected by:\n\u25a0 geopolitical concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;\n\u25a0 natural disasters and health concerns;\n\u25a0 inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, or telecommunications providers;\n\u25a0 restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries, nationalization of our operations, and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings;\n\u25a0 differing employment practices and labor issues; and\n\u25a0 local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nLegal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nOur research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) may be adversely affected by ongoing developments in Belarus and Ukraine.\nWe have a significant number of R&D personnel in Belarus. Belarus shares borders with both Russia and Ukraine. In February 2022, in connection with escalating tensions involving Russia and Ukraine, Russian military personnel stationed in Belarus were part of an invasion force by Russian forces into Ukraine. In response to the support and facilitation by Belarus for the invasion, the United States, the European Union, or EU, and various other nations imposed sanctions against multiple individuals and entities in Belarus. Other potential retaliatory measures could be taken by the United States and other countries, particularly if Belarus were to take a more active role in the conflict. While we continue to monitor the situation in Belarus closely, any prolonged or expanded unrest, military activities, or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our future product roadmap and R&D. We cannot predict whether additional sanctions or other measures will be imposed, or the nature of severity of those measures, and whether they will directly or indirectly impact our R&D in Belarus or elsewhere.\nFurther, our Belarussian R&D personnel could be impacted by retaliatory actions taken by third parties related to actual or perceived Belarussian actions in support of the invasion, including cyberattacks.\nShould the military conflict expand to Belarus, our operations there could likely be impacted, including due to availability of personnel, electrical outages, cyber-attacks and actual battles in areas where we have personnel.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our ability to research and develop new technology, including corrections or enhancements of existing platforms supporting our current products and services or development of new or complementary offerings.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nWe have international operations with revenues outside the United States representing a substantial amount of our total revenues. As a result, our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth, or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nFailure in our data center or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions.\nAll data centers, including ours, are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. Any failure or downtime could affect a significant percentage of our customers. The total destruction or severe impairment of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of customer data.\nOur ability to provide cloud-based communication services is dependent upon our physical and cloud-based infrastructure. While most of our physical equipment required for providing these services is redundant in nature, certain types of failures or malfunctioning of critical hardware/software equipment, including but not limited to fire, water or other physical damage may impact our ability to deliver continuous service to our customers. Acts of God or terrorism or vandalism or negligence or gross negligence of person(s) currently or formerly associated with us including failure to properly update and maintain infrastructure may result in loss of revenue, profitability, and failure to retain and acquire new customers.\nOur ability to recover from disasters or failures, if and when they occur, is paramount to offering continued service to our existing customers. We maintain redundant physical infrastructure between our data centers in Newark, New Jersey and Somerset, New Jersey for disaster recovery. We maintain a core site in a data center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and telecommunications points of presence in multiple cities in Brazil. We operate multiple server sites in data centers in Canada, running UCaaS software licensed from a third party. We also operate servers in data centers in Hong Kong, London, and Spain. These network footprints do not guarantee continued reliability if a catastrophic event occurs. Despite implementation of network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks. In addition, if there is a breach or alleged breach of security or privacy involving our services, including but not limited to data loss, or if any third party undertakes illegal or harmful actions using our communications or e-commerce services, our business and reputation could suffer substantial adverse publicity and impairment. We have experienced interruptions in service in the past. We have taken and continue to take steps to improve our infrastructure to prevent service interruptions.\nIn addition to our physical infrastructure, we have a cloud infrastructure deployment with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and Google Cloud that supplements and extends our physical infrastructure. We utilize AWS\u2019s and Google Cloud\u2019s high availability configurations using multiple availability zones and we have services deployed in multiple AWS regions. However, we do not have cross region redundancy, which means we cannot guarantee continued reliability if AWS or Google Cloud suffers a catastrophic event which disrupts a region in which we have our services deployed. If there were a failure to respond quickly to problems, or such a catastrophic event were to occur, our customers may experience service interruptions and we may suffer customer losses.\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nOur primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and operating expenses. The strengthening of foreign currencies may increase our cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting our earnings. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated revenues and earnings and could lead us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, we may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated revenue and earnings.\nWe depend upon industry standard protocols and third-party software, including but not limited to open-source software.\nWe rely on non-proprietary third-party software, some of which may be open source. We may be subject to additional royalties, license or trademark infringement costs or other unknown costs when one or more of these third-party technologies are affected or need to be replaced due to end-of-support or end-of-sale of such third parties.\nCertain functions related to our business depend on a single supplier or small group of suppliers to carry out our business, and the inability to do business with some or all of these suppliers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf the services of any of the single suppliers or small group of suppliers, including, without limitation, software from third-party service providers used in certain of our products and services, that we depend on were unavailable, or available only in decreased capacity or at less advantageous terms, this could result in interruptions to our ability to provide certain services, could cause reduction in service and/or quality as the function is transitioned to an alternate provider, if an alternate provider is available, or could increase our cost, which in the current competitive environment, we may not be able to pass along to customers. Accordingly, any of these events could materially and negatively impact our business, our revenues, our profits, and our relationships with customers.\nNatural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our technological infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyberattacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. Although we make significant efforts towards managing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our inability to operate our networks because of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in loss of revenue, significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to provide customer service that effectively supports the needs of our customers.\nProviding customer service effectively requires that our customer support personnel have industry-specific technical knowledge and expertise. Our support personnel require extensive training on our products and services, which may make it difficult to scale up our support operations rapidly or effectively. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-implementation issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional features and services to existing customers will suffer and our reputation may be harmed.\nChanges to rates by our suppliers and increasing regulatory charges or tariffs may require us to raise prices, which could impact results.\nOur upstream carriers, suppliers and vendors may increase their prices thus directly impacting our cost of revenues, which would affect our earnings. Interconnected VoIP traffic may be subject to increased charges. Should this occur, the rates paid to our underlying carriers may increase which could reduce our profitability. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently un-tariffed products or services could affect the price and sales of our products for a certain set of customers. Changes in our underlying costs of revenues may cause us to increase the rates we charge our customers which could make us less competitive and impact our sales and retention of existing customers.\nOur customers, particularly our IDT Global customers, could experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if we experience difficulties in collecting our receivables.\nAs a provider of international long-distance services, we depend upon sales of transmission and termination of traffic to other long-distance providers and the collection of receivables from these customers. The wholesale telecommunications market continues to feature many smaller, less financially stable companies. If weakness in the telecommunications industry or the global economy reduces our ability to collect our accounts receivable from our major customers, particularly our wholesale customers, our profitability may be substantially reduced. While our most significant customers, from a revenue perspective, vary from quarter to quarter, our five largest IDT Global customers collectively accounted for 4.6% and 4.5% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Our IDT Global customers with the five largest receivables balances collectively accounted for 7.8% and 8.8% of our total gross trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This concentration of revenues and receivables increases our exposure to non-payment by our larger customers, and we may experience significant write-offs if any of our large customers fail to pay their outstanding balances, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nWe believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization, in particular our technology and software engineering organization. Competition for qualified technology and engineering employees is intense and our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nNew and existing technologies could affect our ability to track the results of ads and/or could block ads online, which would harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from customers acquired in connection with the display of advertisements online. Technologies have been developed to make tracking the results of our online advertisements more difficult or to block the display of advertisements altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality of third-party digital advertising. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith.\nWe are responding to the global outbreak of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by governments to protect the population. We continue to execute our business continuity plan and have implemented a comprehensive set of actions for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and business partners. Our employees transitioned to work-from-home during fiscal 2020 and, to a large degree, continue to work-from-home. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain of our employees returned to work in our offices on a hybrid basis.\nWe continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure our systems remain functional to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. We face challenges due to the need to operate with the remote workforce and are addressing those challenges to minimize the impact on our ability to operate.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic resurges and has a more significant impact than currently, our business, operations, and financial condition could be impacted in more significant ways. The continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could have the following impacts, in addition to exacerbating the impacts described above:\n\u25a0 Adversely impact our strategic business plans and growth strategy;\n\u25a0 Result in increases in bad debt expense and accounts receivable write-offs as a result of delayed or non-payment from our customers;\n\u25a0 Reduce demand for our offerings as widespread unemployment reduces consumer buying power;\n\u25a0 Reduce the availability and productivity of our employees and third-party resources;\n\u25a0 Cause us to experience an increase in costs as a result of our emergency measures;\n\u25a0 Cause impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets; and\n\u25a0 Cause a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that adversely impacts our credit ratings.\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had not experienced significant adverse impacts to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows due to the impact of COVID-19. However, the situation remains fluid and we cannot predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have attempted to control our operating expenses by utilizing lower-cost labor in foreign countries such as Belarus, Guatemala, and Israel and we may in the future expand our reliance on offshore labor to other countries. Our employees in Belarus and Israel primarily help develop, test, and maintain certain of our technology. Our labor source in Guatemala primarily performs certain call center, administrative, and customer acquisition functions. We also have significant operations in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina as a result of net2phone\u2019s growth.\nCountries outside of the United States may be subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. The occurrence of natural disasters, pandemics, such as COVID-19, or political or economic instability in these countries could interfere with work performed by these labor sources or could result in our having to replace or reduce these labor sources. If countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially when such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired. Our vendors in other countries could potentially shut down suddenly for any reason, including financial problems or personnel issues. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States. Governmental authorities could seek to impose financial costs or restrictions on foreign companies providing services to customers or companies in the United States. Governmental authorities may attempt to prohibit or otherwise discourage us from sourcing services from offshore labor.\nThe FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit certain types of payments by our employees, vendors, and agents. Any violation of the applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could expose us to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs, and consent orders that may curtail or restrict our business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWeakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these foreign countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our NRS Business\nThe long-term success of NRS depends on its ability to develop products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for POS products and services, and, if it is not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for its products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nNRS\u2019 success will depend, in part, on its ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. New services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the POS products and services that NRS currently offers or the technologies NRS currently uses to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into NRS\u2019 POS products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and NRS may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. NRS\u2019 ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from its customers, which includes NRS\u2019 sellers and their buyers, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If NRS is unable to provide enhancements and new features for its products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition in the POS industry may harm NRS\u2019 business.\nNRS competes in the POS market that is characterized by vigorous competition, changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new services or enhance existing services. NRS competes against many companies to attract customers, and some of these companies have greater financial resources and substantially larger bases of customers than NRS does, which may provide them with significant competitive advantages. These companies may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, may achieve economies of scale due to the size of their customer bases, and may more effectively introduce their own innovative products and services that adversely impacts NRS\u2019 growth. Currently, we believe that NRS has a competitive advantage because of our focus and marketing reach into independent stores, often in immigrant communities in the United States. If some or all of our competitors focus additional resources on those customers, NRS\u2019 growth may slow, or we may lose customers due to the competition. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources.\nNRS may also face pricing pressures from competitors. Some potential competitors are able to offer lower prices to sellers for similar services by subsidizing their payments services through other services they offer. Such competition may result in the need for NRS to alter the pricing that it offers and could reduce our profitability.\nIf NRS fails to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on its platform, our business could be harmed.\nNRS\u2019 strategy includes increasing its revenues from brand advertising. Brands may not do business with NRS or may reduce the amounts they are willing to spend to advertise if NRS does not deliver ads, and other commercial content and marketing programs in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with NRS will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. NRS\u2019 ability to grow the number of brands that use its brand advertising, and ultimately to generate advertising and marketing services revenues, depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If NRS fails to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on its platform, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our net2phone Business\nnet2phone\u2019s VoIP or cloud-based communications service competes against established well financed alternative voice communication providers (such as Ring Central, 8x8 and Five9), who may provide comparable services at comparable or lower pricing.\nPricing in the telecommunications industry is very fluid and competitive. Price is often a substantial motivation factor in a customer\u2019s decision to switch to net2phone\u2019s cloud-based communications products and services. net2phone\u2019s competitors may reduce their rates, which may require it to reduce its rates, which would affect our revenues and profitability, or otherwise make our pricing non-competitive. net2phone may be at a disadvantage compared with those competitors who have substantially greater resources than us or may otherwise be better positioned to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure.\nMany of net2phone\u2019s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and brand awareness, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with net2phone\u2019s existing and potential customers. net2phone\u2019s competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that present a more differentiated or better integrated product to customers. Announcements, or expectations, as to the introduction of new products and technologies by net2phone\u2019s competitors or net2phone could cause customers to defer purchases of net2phone\u2019s existing products, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nnet2phone depends in part upon the capacity, reliability, and performance of several third-party providers and their network infrastructure, the failure of which could cause delays or interruptions of net2phone\u2019s service and impact our revenue and profitability.\nnet2phone depends on several third-party providers to provide uninterrupted and error-free service to maintain its operations. net2phone does not have control over these providers, and some of these providers are also its competitors. net2phone may be subject to interruptions or delays in their service and its reputation and business may be harmed. The failure of any of these third party service providers to properly maintain services may result in negative consequences to net2phone, including but not limited to: (i) a loss of customers, (ii) adverse impact on its reputation, (iii) negative publicity, (iv) negative impact on its ability to acquire customers, (v) negative impact on its revenue and profitability, (vi) potential law suits for not reaching emergency E-911 services, and (vii) potential law suits for loss of business and loss of reputation. These third-party providers include but are not limited to: 4PSA, an opensource, Kamilio, based platform provider based in Romania and NetSapiens Inc. based in San Diego, CA. 4PSA is net2phone\u2019s current communications platform in South America and continues to serve as a legacy platform for a smaller percentage of customers in the U.S. NetSapiens is net2phone\u2019s current platform for its customers in Canada.\nInternet Bandwidth Providers. net2phone\u2019s cloud-based communications service requires its customers to have an operative broadband Internet connection and an electrical power supply, which are provided by the customer\u2019s broadband Internet service provider and electric utility company and not by net2phone. The quality of some broadband Internet connections may be too poor for customers to use net2phone\u2019s services properly. In addition, if there is any interruption to a customer\u2019s broadband Internet service or electrical power supply, that customer will be unable to make or receive calls, including emergency calls, using net2phone\u2019s service. In addition, Internet backbone providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to, or the bandwidth use of certain of net2phone\u2019s products and services which could have a negative effect on its services and could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users. Further, customers who access net2phone\u2019s mobile application (or future applications) through their smartphones must have a high-speed connection to use its services. This access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace and some of these providers offer products and services that directly compete with net2phone\u2019s offerings, which give them a significant competitive advantage.\nTier 1 and non-Tier 1 Telecom suppliers for Telecom Origination and Termination Services. net2phone depends on these companies to provide telecom services, sourcing of DID, porting of numbers and delivering telephone calls from and to endpoints and devices on our network. If net2phone fails to maintain reliable connectivity or performance with its upstream carriers it could significantly reduce customer demand for its services and damage its business.\nE-911 and other emergency service providers. net2phone maintains an agreement with an E-911 provider to assist it in routing and terminating emergency calls directly to an emergency service dispatcher at the public-safety answering point, or PSAP, in the area of the customer\u2019s registered location. net2phone also contract with a provider for the national call center that operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive certain emergency calls and with several companies that maintain PSAP databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. The dispatcher will have automatic access to the customer\u2019s telephone number and registered location information. If a customer moves their service to a new location, the customer\u2019s registered location information must be updated and verified by the customer. Until that takes place, the customer will have to verbally advise the emergency dispatcher of his or her actual location at the time of an E-911 call. This can lead to delays in the delivery of emergency services. Interruptions in service from these vendors could also cause failures in net2phone\u2019s customers\u2019 access to E-911 services and expose it to liability.\nLocal number portability providers. net2phone has agreements with companies that initiate its local number portability, which allows new customers to retain their existing telephone numbers when subscribing to its services. net2phone needs to work with these companies to properly port numbers. The failure to port numbers may cause net2phone to lose customers.\nnet2phone faces risks from the outsourcing of the manufacturing of its desktop telephones (\u201cdesktop devices\u201d).\nnet2phone primarily sells Polycom, Yealink and Grandstream-branded desktop devices, although, it supports other third-party devices as well. These desktop devices are being manufactured by vendors in China. Recent supply-chain challenges in China and global ramifications of supply-chain difficulties, the U.S. trade war with China, including trade protection measures such as tariffs, and the effects of any new wave of COVID-19 infections or another pandemic may cause disruptions in obtaining its desktop devices. This may increase pricing, slow delivery times or may force net2phone to find another third-party manufacturer of its branded desktop devices.\nnet2phone targets sales to small, mid-market and enterprise customers. Not properly managing these customers could negatively affect our business, cash flow and operations.\nA substantial percentage of net2phone\u2019s revenues comes from small and medium-sized businesses. These customers may be more adversely affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. The majority of net2phone\u2019s customers pay for subscriptions with credit cards. Weakness in certain segments of the credit markets in the U.S. and global economies may result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments, which could negatively affect net2phone\u2019s business. If small and medium-sized businesses experience financial hardship because of a weakening economy, industry consolidation, or any other reason, the overall demand for net2phone\u2019s products and services could be materially and adversely affected.\nSelling to larger enterprise customers also contains inherent risks and uncertainties. The loss of a key customer or a failure of some of them to renew or to continue to recommend net2phone\u2019s products may have a material negative impact on its results. net2phone has a limited history of selling its services to larger businesses and may experience challenges in configuring and providing ongoing support for the products it sells to large customers. Larger customers\u2019 networks are often more complex than those of smaller customers, and the configuration of services for these customers usually requires customer assistance. There is no guarantee that the customer will make available to net2phone the necessary personnel and other resources for a successful configuration of services. Lack of assistance from the customers or lack of local resources may prevent net2phone from properly configuring its services for these customers, which can in turn adversely impact the quality of services that it delivers over its customers\u2019 networks, and/or may result in delays in the implementation of its services and impact the quality and ability to continue to provide the services. This could also create a public perception that net2phone is unable to deliver high quality service to its customers, which could harm its reputation. In addition to the foregoing, larger customers tend to require higher levels of customer service and individual attention, which may increase net2phone\u2019s costs for implementing and delivering services.\nIf net2phone\u2019s existing customers terminate their subscriptions or reduce their subscriptions and related usage, its revenues and earnings will be harmed, and we will be required to spend more money to grow net2phone\u2019s customer base.\nnet2phone expects to continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from existing customers. As a result, retaining its existing customers is critical to its future operating results. net2phone offers monthly, annual and multiple-year contracts to its customers, generally with 30 days\u2019 notice required for reductions in the number of seats. Increases in the number of seats can be provisioned almost immediately.\nSubscriptions and related usage by existing customers may decrease if:\n\u25a0 customers are not satisfied with the services, prices or the functionality of net2phone\u2019s products;\n\u25a0 the stability, performance or security of net2phone\u2019s products are not satisfactory;\n\u25a0 the U.S. or global economy declines;\n\u25a0 net2phone\u2019s customers\u2019 business or demand for net2phone\u2019s services declines due to industry cycles, seasonality, business difficulties or other reasons, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25a0 customers favor products offered by other providers, particularly as competition continues to increase;\n\u25a0 alternative technologies, products or features emerge or gain popularity that net2phone does not provide;\n\u25a0 net2phone\u2019s customers or potential customers experience financial difficulties; or\n\u25a0 fewer customers purchase services from net2phone.\nIf net2phone\u2019s existing customers\u2019 subscriptions and related usage decrease or are terminated, net2phone will need to spend more money to acquire new customers and still may not be able to maintain its existing level of revenues. net2phone incurs significant costs and expenses, including sales and marketing expenses, to acquire new customers, and those costs and expenses are an important factor in determining our profitability. There can be no assurance that net2phone\u2019s efforts to acquire new customers will be successful.\nnet2phone must acquire new customers on an ongoing basis to maintain and increase its customers and revenues while the significant costs to acquire new customers may hinder profitability.\nnet2phone will have to acquire new customers in order to increase revenues. net2phone incurs significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our profitability. Therefore, if net2phone is unsuccessful in retaining customers or is required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers, its revenue and or profits would decrease, which would negatively affect profitability. Sales and marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of net2phone\u2019s business as it strives to acquire more new customers.\nnet2phone\u2019s customer churn rate may increase in future periods, which may adversely impact its revenue or require it to spend more money to grow its customer base.\nnet2phone\u2019s customers generally have initial service periods of between two and three years and may discontinue their subscriptions for services after the expiration of their initial subscription period. In addition, net2phone\u2019s customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. net2phone may not accurately predict cancellation rates for its customers. net2phone\u2019s cancellation rates may increase or fluctuate because of a number of factors, including customer needs, pricing changes, number of applications used by its customers, customer satisfaction with its service, the acquisition of net2phone\u2019s customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. If net2phone\u2019s customers do not renew their subscriptions for its service or decrease the amount they spend with net2phone, its revenue will decline, and our business will suffer.\nnet2phone may not be able to scale its business efficiently or quickly enough to meet its customers\u2019 growing needs, in which case our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of net2phone\u2019s cloud-based communications services by mid-market and larger distributed enterprises expands and as customers continue to integrate its services across their enterprises, net2phone is required to devote additional resources to improving its application architecture, integrating net2phone\u2019s products and applications across our technology platform as well as expanding integration and performance. net2phone will need to appropriately scale its internal business systems and services organization, including its onboarding and customer support services to serve a growing customer base. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could impair net2phone\u2019s systems\u2019 performance and reduce customer satisfaction, which could result in decreased sales to new customers and lower renewal rates by existing customers and eventually hurt net2phone\u2019s revenue growth and its reputation. We cannot guarantee that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, which failure may reduce our revenue and earnings and adversely impact our financial results.\nnet2phone may not realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisition of Integra\u2019s CCaaS business.\nOn March 3, 2022, net2phone purchased all of the outstanding shares of Onwaba S.R.L. and Gem S.R.L. Onwaba S.R.L. and Gem S.R.L. are located in Uruguay and use the trade name Integra CCS, or Integra. Integra provides cloud-based CCaaS in the Americas and Europe.\nThe success of the acquisition of Integra will depend, in part, on net2phone\u2019s ability to provide its customers and channel partners with a robust stand-alone contact center solution or an intelligently integrated UCaaS and CCaaS solution. The target market for the Integra CCaaS solution is two-fold: (i) businesses and other entities with embedded service and support centers; and (ii) contact centers / business process optimization, or BPO, providers (outsourced call centers). Consistent with businesses across the globe that have been moving their on-premise phone systems to the cloud, these service and support centers and contact centers are migrating in a similar fashion, propelled by the growing hybrid and remote work environments. The Integra CCaaS platform is layered with a development surface which allows for custom deployments and sophisticated work force management, where the solution is tailored to the center\u2019s work-flow requirements. This customization will provide for an additional layer of stickiness, which is expected to translate into longer term service periods with the end user. For this reason, we also expect to see increased stickiness with our current and future UCaaS customers that bundle CCaaS into their product suite. We also expect this solution set to open for us a whole new segment of channel partners that specifically target CCaaS audiences. Our capacity to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks, including, among others:\n\u25a0 our ability to successfully integrate the CCaaS business;\n\u25a0 the risk that the CCaaS business will not perform as expected;\n\u25a0 the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Integra; and\n\u25a0 the risk of any negative impact on our business not discovered during our due diligence.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate Integra\u2019s CCaaS business within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated synergies, operational efficiencies and other benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, and we may not perform as expected.\nIntegrating Integra\u2019s CCaaS business may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected.\nThere can be no assurances that Integra\u2019s CCaaS business can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of net2phone\u2019s ongoing UCaaS business or unexpected integration issues, such as higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Integra in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, so net2phone performs as expected include, among others:\n\u25a0 combining Integra\u2019s operational, financial, reporting and corporate functions with net2phone;\n\u25a0 integrating the companies\u2019 technologies, products and services;\n\u25a0 identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u25a0 harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u25a0 addressing the differences of a foreign culture and management philosophies;\n\u25a0 maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u25a0 attracting and recruiting prospective employees;\n\u25a0 maintaining existing agreements with customers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and vendors; and\n\u25a0 coordinating and servicing geographically dispersed organizations.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of some of net2phone\u2019s employees may be focused on the integration of the CCaaS business and diverted from day-to-day UCaaS business operations, which may disrupt net2phone\u2019s ongoing business and, consequently, both the UCaaS and CCaaS businesses.\nRisks Related to Our Traditional Communications Business\nEach of our BOSS Revolution Calling and IDT Global businesses is highly sensitive to declining prices, which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe worldwide telecommunications industry is characterized by intense price competition, which has resulted in declines in both our average per-minute price realizations and our average per-minute termination costs. Many of our competitors continue to aggressively price their services or offer them for free. The intense competition has led to continued erosion in our pricing power, in both our retail and wholesale markets, and we have generally had to pass along all or some of the savings we achieve on our per-minute costs to our customers in the form of lower prices. In the case of some international calling locations, when average per minute termination cost decline to a nominal amount, indirect competitors, such as wireless carriers, may include calls to those locations at no extra cost, which increases our risk of losing customers. Any price increase by either our BOSS Revolution Calling, or IDT Global business may result in our prices becoming less attractive to customers, which may result in a reduction of revenue. If these trends in pricing continue or accelerate, it could have a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our BOSS Revolution Calling and IDT Global businesses and/or our profitability.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient or cost-effective termination capacity to particular destinations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nMost of our telecommunications\u2019 traffic is terminated through third-party providers. In order to support our minutes of use demands and geographic footprint, we may need to obtain additional termination capacity or destinations. We may not be able to obtain sufficient termination capacity from high-quality carriers to particular destinations or may have to pay significant amounts to obtain such capacity. This could result in our not being able to support our minutes of use demands or in higher cost-per-minute to particular destinations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nThe termination of our carrier agreements with partners or our inability to enter into carrier agreements in the future could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete, which could reduce our revenues and profits.\nWe rely upon our carrier agreements with partners in order to provide our telecommunications services to our customers. These carrier agreements are for finite terms and, therefore, there can be no guarantee that these agreements will be renewed at all or on favorable terms to us. Our ability to compete would be adversely affected if our carrier agreements were terminated or we were unable to enter into carrier agreements in the future to provide our telecommunications services to our customers, which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits.\nOur U.K.-based businesses and business between the United Kingdom and other countries face risks related to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d).\nWe operate our business worldwide, including meaningful operations in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, we are subjected to risks from changes in the regulatory environment in various countries. On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The United Kingdom formally left the EU on April 30, 2020 and had entered a transition period until December 31, 2020. The EU and the United Kingdom concluded the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) on December 24, 2020, which took effect provisionally on January 1, 2021, following the end of the formal transition period and will become formally applicable once ratified by both the United Kingdom and the EU. The TCA sets out the arrangements between the United Kingdom and EU on trade in certain areas (e.g., goods and some services, energy, fisheries, social security coordination), however there is still uncertainty over how its terms will play out in practice and there are still key aspects of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the EU which are not covered by the TCA, such as in respect of financial services. We expect that uncertainty over the terms of the TCA and other future agreements between the United Kingdom and EU will continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, which could harm our business and financial results. The withdrawal will, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. Until there is greater understanding on how the terms of the TCA will play out in practice, and until the terms of other potential agreements that the United Kingdom may eventually enter into with the EU are known, it is not possible to determine the extent of the impact that the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU and/or any related matters may have on us; however, any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Likewise, similar actions taken by European and other countries in which we operate could have a similar or even more profound impact.\nFurther, Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the Euro. We are exposed to the economic, market, and fiscal conditions in the United Kingdom and the EU and to changes in any of these conditions.\nIDT Financial Services Limited, or IDTFS, our Gibraltar-based bank, currently operates under a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. As an overseas British Territory, following the expiration of the Brexit transition period, the passporting rights previously enjoyed by IDTFS under EU law have ceased to be in effect. Since we did not secure an e-money license from an EU country prior to expiration of the transition period, alternative arrangements were made with third parties to service customers in EU countries previously serviced by IDTFS. Our inability to service these customers will lead to a reduction in the revenues previously earned from them.\nRisk Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe hold cash, cash equivalents, debt securities and equity investments that are subject to various market risks.\nAt July 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments of $137.7 million. Debt securities and equity investments carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that we can redeem them at any time and that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict the course of price movements and, in general, the securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, debt securities and equity investments could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis\nWe cannot be certain that we will continue to maintain an effective system of internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The New York Stock Exchange, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\nWe provide communications and payment services to consumers and are therefore subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.\nAs a provider of communications and payment services to consumers, such as BOSS Revolution Calling or BOSS Money, we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the manner in which we advertise our services, describe and present the terms of our services, and communicate with our customers and consumers in general. Compliance with these laws requires us to be constantly vigilant as they often vary from state to state. Failure to comply with these laws could result in action being taken by federal and state agencies or offices responsible for consumer protection, like the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues, and profits.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe depend on proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights in conducting our various business operations. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective enough. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, and we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our businesses. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful.\nIn addition, we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any such litigation.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues, and profits.\nCompanies in the telecommunications industry and other industries in which we compete own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Although we do not believe that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. From time to time we may be subject to claims and legal proceedings from third parties regarding alleged infringement by us of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. Such suits can be expensive and time consuming and could distract us and our management from focusing on our businesses. Further, loss of such suits could result in financial burdens and the requirement to modify our modes of operation, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to tax and regulatory audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing and regulatory authorities with respect to certain of our income and operations. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing entity.\nOur 2017 FCC Form 499-A, which reports our calendar year 2016 revenue is currently under audit by the Universal Service Administrative Company, or USAC. The Internal Audit Division of USAC issued preliminary audit findings and we have, in accordance with audit procedures, appealed certain of the findings. We are awaiting a final decision by USAC on the preliminary audit findings. Depending on the findings contained in the final decision, we may further appeal to the FCC. As of July 31, 2022, our accrued expenses included $33.2 million for FCC-related regulatory fees for the year covered by the audit, as well as prior and subsequent years. If we do not properly calculate, or have not properly calculated, the amount payable by us to the FCC, we may be subject to interest and penalties.\nWe are subject to value added tax, or VAT, audits from time-to-time in various jurisdictions. In the conduct of such audits, we may be required to disclose information of a sensitive nature and, in general, to modify the way we have conducted business with our distributors until the present, which may affect our business in an adverse manner.\nWe are also subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various other taxes, including utility excise tax, sales and use tax, communications services tax, gross receipts tax and property tax.\nOur business is subject to strict regulation under federal law regarding anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing. Failure to comply with such laws, or abuse of our programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProvisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other federal laws impose substantial regulations on financial institutions that are designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of our industry with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing matters could result in more aggressive enforcement of these laws or the enactment of more onerous regulation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, abuse of our money transfer services or prepaid card programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, notwithstanding our efforts to prevent such abuse through our regulatory compliance and risk management programs, could cause reputational or other harm that would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent illegal or illicit activity and our failure, or the failure of one of our disbursement partners or payment processors to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur money transfer and network branded prepaid card services are subject to a strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state, and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements by us, our regulated retailers or our disbursement partners could result in the suspension or revocation of a money transmitter license, the limitation, suspension or termination of our services, the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines.\nFurthermore, failure by us or our agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also result in termination of contracts with our banks and/or merchant payment processors. Termination of services by one of our retail banks would seriously diminish our ability to collect funds from our BOSS Revolution agents. Likewise, termination of services by our merchant processor would negatively impact our ability to process payments in our digital channels.\nThe foregoing laws and regulations are constantly evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. If we fail to update our compliance system to reflect legislative or regulatory developments, we could incur penalties. New legislation, changes in laws or regulations, implementing rules and regulations, litigation, court rulings, changes in industry practices or standards, changes in systems rules or requirements or other similar events could expose us to increased compliance costs, liability, reputational damage, and could reduce the market value of our money transfer and network branded prepaid card services or render them less profitable or obsolete.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could harm us and the scope of our activities, and could harm our operations, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in the United States on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and substantive regulation across the financial services industry. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, whose purpose is to issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money transfer services.\nWe may be subject to examination by the CFPB, which has broad authority to enforce consumer financial laws. The CFPB has a large budget and staff and has broad authority with respect to our money transfer service and related business. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. The CFPB\u2019s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or alter past regulatory guidance, could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Counsel that is authorized to designate as \u201csystemically important\u201d non-bank financial companies and payment systems. Companies designated under either standard will become subject to new regulation and regulatory supervision. If we were designated under either standard, the additional regulatory and supervisory requirements could result in costly new compliance burdens or may require changes in the way we conduct business that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to licensing and other requirements imposed by U.S. state regulators, and the U.S. federal government. If we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing money transmitters, we could lose our licenses, be subject to liability or be forced to change our business practices, which could harm our operations, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA number of states and territories have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters, with 49 states requiring a license as of July 31, 2022. At July 31, 2022, we had obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in 48 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. We are also registered as money services businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to bonding requirements, liquidity requirements, restrictions on our investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, and inspection by state and foreign regulatory agencies. If we were found to be subject to and in violation of any banking or money services laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability or additional restrictions, such as increased liquidity requirements. In addition, our licenses could be revoked, or we could be forced to cease doing business or change our practices in certain states or jurisdictions or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. Regulators could also impose other regulatory orders and sanctions on us. Any change to our business practices that makes our service less attractive to customers or prohibits use of our services by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease our transaction volume and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur disbursement partners generally are regulated institutions in their home jurisdiction, and money transfers are regulated by governments in both the United States and in the jurisdiction of the recipient. If our disbursement partners fail to comply with applicable laws, it could harm our business., results of operations, and financial condition.\nMoney transfers are regulated by state, federal and foreign governments. Many of our disbursement partners are banks that are heavily regulated by their home jurisdictions. Our non-bank disbursement partners are also subject to money transfer regulations. We require regulatory compliance as a condition to our continued relationship, perform due diligence on our disbursement partners, and monitor them periodically with the goal of meeting regulatory expectations. However, there are limits to the extent to which we can monitor their regulatory compliance. Any determination that our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs. While our services are not directly regulated by governments outside the United States, except with respect to our Gibraltar bank as discussed below, it is possible that in some cases we could be liable for the failure of our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners to comply with laws, which also could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIDTFS in Gibraltar is regulated by the Gibraltar FSC, and, as such, is subject to Gibraltarian and EU laws relating to financial institutions. As an issuer of prepaid debit cards for programs operated by other entities, commonly known as program managers, IDTFS is responsible, inter alia, for anti-money laundering laws oversight and compliance. If we were to fail to implement the requisite controls or follow the rules and procedures mandated by the FSC and applicable law, we could be subject to regulatory fines, and even the loss of our banking license.\nWe receive, store, process and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other customer data, including bank account numbers, credit and debit card information, identification numbers, and images of government identification cards. As a result, we are required to comply with the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. There are also numerous other federal, state, local and international laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions or conflict with other applicable rules. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices.\nAdditionally, with advances in computer capabilities and data protection requirements to address ongoing threats, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against potential security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, or litigation. If there is a breach of credit or debit card information that we store, we could also be liable to the issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, a significant breach could result in our being prohibited from processing transactions for any of the relevant network organizations, such as Visa or MasterCard, which would harm our business. If any third parties with whom we work, such as marketing partners, vendors, or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could harm our business. Any negative publicity arising out of a data breach or failure to comply with applicable privacy requirements could damage our reputation and cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial position, and potential for growth.\nWe may be harmed by certain imminent FCC Orders and rules that effect the telecommunications marketplace.\nIn the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence, or TRACED, Act, Congress gave the FCC new tools to fight unwanted, and often illegal, robocalls, the top consumer complaint reported to the FCC annually. The TRACED Act required the FCC to mandate the STIR/SHAKEN caller identification framework. STIR/SHAKEN enables phone companies to verify that the caller ID information transmitted with a call matches the caller\u2019s real phone number. The FCC has issued a series of Orders and adopted several rules to implement the TRACED Act. For example, by June 30, 2021, many domestic and foreign carriers must register with the FCC specifically for TRACED Act compliance. Initially, the FCC concluded that by September 28, 2021, we and other similarly situated carriers would not be able to accept certain IP-based telecommunications traffic from foreign and domestic carrier partners unless those carriers are registered with the FCC. However, the FCC temporarily suspended this obligation while it reconsiders its impact. We believe the FCC will eventually reinstate the rule or implement a new rule that will have a comparable impact upon us and the industry as a whole. We also believe the FCC will continue to address and refine its rules in this area. Of equal importance, carriers such as us have the right to \u201csign\u201d their traffic, effectively attesting that the traffic they are transmitting is not illegal robocalls.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules present several concerns to all carriers. Notably, the rules extend to many foreign carriers, and it is unclear whether foreign carriers will be sufficiently educated and experienced to implement U.S. rules and regulations. Foreign carrier compliance, or the lack thereof, could impact U.S. carriers as they seek to meet their own regulatory obligations. There may also be changes in the marketplace as foreign carriers may look to limit U.S. carrier partners to whom they transmit calls for termination in the U.S. that are subject to the STIR/SHAKEN rules.\nIn Canada, the CRTC is implementing near-identical STIR/SHAKEN rules as the FCC is implementing in the U.S. although it is not apparent whether the Canadian regulator will punish service providers who fail to meet their obligations with the zealousness of the U.S. regulator. We find it likely that additional national communications regulators will implement similar, if not identical, STIR/SHAKEN legislation.\nWe anticipate meeting our regulatory obligations under the STIR/SHAKEN rules and we are undertaking efforts to prevent us from being harmed by potential changes in the marketplace. Nevertheless, the FCC\u2019s rules allow for the possibility that well-prepared carriers with anti-robocalling procedures in place may fail and be punished for their failure, despite their best efforts. Moreover, because the STIR/SHAKEN rules may have a significant impact on the telecommunications marketplace, it is difficult to predict their outcome. We are prepared for the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN but are concerned about its impact on the market as a whole and on us specifically.\nFederal and state regulations may be passed that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide VoIP communications services at attractive rates arises in large part from the fact that VoIP services are not currently subject to the same level of regulation as traditional, switch-based telephony. The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is largely unregulated within the United States, although several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. In the United States, the California PUC has initiated a proceeding under which we believe the PUC will expand its authority to regulate interconnected VOIP. Other states are near-certain to follow the California PUC\u2019s lead. If interconnected VoIP services become subject to state regulation and/or additional regulation by the FCC, such regulation will likely lead to higher costs and reduce or eliminate the competitive advantage interconnected VoIP holds, by virtue of its lesser regulatory oversight, over traditional telecommunications services. More aggressive regulation of the Internet in general, and Internet telephony providers and services specifically, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to offer services outside of the United States is subject to the local regulatory environment, which may be unfavorable, complicated, and often uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment outside the United States varies from country to country. We distribute our products and services through resellers that may be subject to telecommunications regulations in their home countries. The failure of these resellers to comply with these laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability or expose us to audits and other regulatory proceedings. Regulatory developments such as these could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn many countries in which we operate, or our services are sold, the status of the laws that may relate to our services is unclear. We cannot be certain that our customers, resellers, or other affiliates are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in their respective countries, that they or we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements, and/or that they or we will continue in compliance with any requirements. Our failure or the failure of those with whom we transact business to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we expect additional regulation of our industry in some or all of these areas, and we expect continuing changes in the regulatory environment as new and proposed regulations are reviewed, revised and amended, we cannot predict with certainty what impact new laws in these areas will have on us, if any.\nnet2phone\u2019s VoIP services are subject to regulation in the United States and Canada. Future legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions could adversely affect net2phone\u2019s business and expose it to liability and limit its growth potential.\nThe United States and Canada have applied some traditional telephone company regulations to VoIP and continue to evaluate how VoIP should be regulated, as are other countries as we expand globally. The effects of future regulatory developments are uncertain. At the federal level in the United States, the FCC has imposed certain telecommunications regulations on VoIP services including, but not limited to:\n\u25a0 Requirements to provide E-911 service;\n\u25a0 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act obligations;\n\u25a0 Obligation to support Universal Service;\n\u25a0 Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, requirements;\n\u25a0 Disability access obligations;\n\u25a0 Local Number Portability requirements; and\n\u25a0 Consumer protection, including protection from unwanted telemarketing and other calls.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, regulates VoIP Service. These regulated services are similar to those regulated in the United States discussed above. We are subject to a variety of other federal, state and international laws and regulations as well as oversight from a variety of governmental agencies and public service commissions. The laws governing our business may change in ways that harm our business. Federal, state or international governmental agencies administering and enforcing such laws may also choose to interpret and apply them in ways that harm our business. These interpretations are also subject to change. Regulatory action could materially impair or force us to change our business model and may adversely affect our revenue, increase our compliance costs, and reduce our profitability. In addition, governmental agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service, FTC, FCC, and state taxing authorities may conclude that we have violated federal laws, state laws or other rules and regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other actions that could adversely impact our financial results or our ability to conduct business.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nVarious legal proceedings that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of business have not been finally adjudicated, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition (see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 to Part II of this Annual Report).\nOur telecommunications services are required to comply with industry standards, FCC regulations, privacy laws as well as certain state and local jurisdiction specific regulations. Failure to comply with existing laws and any new laws that may become applicable to us may subject us to penalties, increase our operation costs, and may also require us to modify existing products and/or service.\nThe acceptance of telecommunications services is dependent upon our meeting certain industry standards. We are required to comply with certain rules and regulations of the FCC regarding safety standards. Standards are continuously being modified and replaced. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products. We must comply with certain federal, state, and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, and billing issues, the provision of 9-1-1 emergency service and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay future offerings and impact our revenues and profitability. Changes to the Universal Service Fund by the FCC or various state Universal Service Funds may require us to increase our costs which could negatively affect revenue and profitability.\nWe are subject to Federal laws and FCC regulations that require us to protect customer information. While we have protections in place to protect customer information there is no assurance that our systems will not be subject to failure or intentional fraudulent attack. The failure to protect required information could subject us to penalties and diminish the confidence our customers have in our systems, which could negatively affect results. While we try to comply with all applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as our own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments to the extent possible, any failure by us to protect our customers\u2019 privacy and data, including as a result of our systems being compromised by hacking or other malicious or surreptitious activity, could result in a loss of customer confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business as well as subject us to law suits, civil fines and criminal penalties.\nGovernmental entities, class action lawyers and consumer advocates are reviewing the data collection and use by companies that must maintain such data. Our own requirements as well as regulatory codes of conduct, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, and lawsuits by other parties could impose additional compliance costs on us as well as subject us to unknown potential liabilities. These evolving laws, rules and practices may also curtail our current business activities, which may delay or affect our ability to become profitable as well as affect customers and other business opportunities.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU, Brazil and Canada, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from their residents, including payment card information, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information, including payment card information identifying, or which may be used to identify, an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses, device identifiers and other data. As we conduct business or become deemed to conduct business in foreign jurisdictions, including through websites that we host that may be available in these locations, we may become subject to those laws and regulations.\nWe are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with federal, state, or international laws, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties with whom we contract may violate or appear to violate laws or regulations which could subject us to the same risks. Any new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations or other standards may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations.\nOur collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views on data privacy, or security breaches.\nWe engage in electronic billing and processing of our customers using secure transmission of sometimes confidential information over public networks. We have systems and processes in place that we deem sufficient and industry standard that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches. However, there is no guarantee that such systems and processes will not experience a failure. Our failure to protect against fraud or breaches may subject us to costly breach notification and other mitigation obligations, class action lawsuits, investigations, fines, forfeitures, or penalties from governmental agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. We may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services. Personal data is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach and which possibly conflict with one another. In recent years, for example, U.S. legislators and regulatory agencies, such as the FTC, as well as U.S. states have increased their focus on protecting personal data by law and regulation and have increased enforcement actions for violations of privacy and data protection requirements. As of January 1, 2020, the CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. While we believe that we are not a covered entity under the law, the effects of the CCPA potentially are significant, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.\nWe may also experience losses due to customer fraud and theft of service, such as fraudulent credit card transactions. Customers have, in the past, obtained access to our service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using fraudulently obtained codes. If our existing anti-fraud procedures are not adequate or effective, consumer fraud and theft of service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe GDPR and the Data Protection Act in the United Kingdom are intended to protect the privacy and security of personal data, including credit card information that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the relevant jurisdiction. We stopped hosting websites in GDPR-complaint countries or countries from which the bulk of business came from countries subject to GDPR. We also took steps to block those countries from accessing any other sites we host. While we do not currently provide services in countries where compliance would be required and are therefore not required to be compliant, if we did provide those services or otherwise were required to become complaint, implementation of and compliance with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position or cash flows.\nAdditionally, media coverage of data breaches has escalated, in part because of the increased number of enforcement actions, investigations, and lawsuits. As this focus and attention on privacy and data protection increases, we also risk exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from compliance with or any failure to comply with applicable legal requirements, conflicts among these legal requirements, or differences in approaches to privacy.\nWe could fail to comply with requirements for debit card, credit card, and other digital payment methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA significant and increasing portion of our transactions are processed using debit cards, credit cards, and other digital payment methods. The banks, credit card companies, networks, and other payment processing providers impose strict regulatory, compliance, system, and other requirements to participate in such parties\u2019 payment systems. We are required to comply with the privacy provisions of various federal and state privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI DSS, each of which is subject to change at any time. Compliance with PCI DSS does not guarantee a completely secure environment and notwithstanding the results of this assessment there can be no assurance that payment card brands will not request further compliance assessments or set forth additional requirements to maintain access to credit card processing services. Compliance with PCI DSS is an ongoing effort, and the requirements evolve as new threats are identified. Compliance with these requirements is often difficult and costly, and our failure, or our counterparty\u2019s failure, to comply may result in significant fines or civil penalties, regulatory enforcement action, liability under or termination of necessary agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or operations and that of our distributors who could be liable as well.\nFurther, our payment services are subject to stringent requirements by regulators and trade organizations in various jurisdictions. Our payment services unit is subject to federal and state banking regulations, and we are also subject to further regulation by those states in which we are licensed as a money transmitter. We may not be able to comply with all such requirements in a timely manner or remain in compliance. If we are not in compliance, we could be subject to penalties or the termination of our rights to participate in such payment systems or provide such services, which could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our businesses and our revenues and profits.\nWe face risks in our sales to certain market segments including, but not limited to, sales subject to HIPAA Regulations.\nOur customers can use our services to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. In addition, customers may use our services to store protected health information, or PHI, that is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. We have sold and will continue to attempt to sell to certain customer segments which may have requirements for additional privacy or security. In addition, sales may be made to customers that are subject to additional security requirements. Selling into segments with additional requirements increases potential liability which in some instances may be unlimited. While we believe we meet or exceed all requirements for sales into such segments, there is no assurance that our systems fully comply with all requirements. Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy and HIPAA may lead to significant fines, penalties or civil liability.\nOur ability to offer services outside the United States is subject to different regulations which may be unknown and uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment of VoIP providers outside the United States varies from country to country, and local jurisdictions. Many times, the laws are vague, unclear and regulations are not enforced uniformly. We are licensed as a VoIP seller in our international markets and are considering expanding to other countries. We also cannot control if our customers take their devices out of the United States and use them abroad. Our resellers may sell to customers who maintain facilities outside the United States. The failure by us or our customers and resellers to comply with laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability. As we expand to additional countries there may be additional regulations that we are required to comply with, the failure to comply or properly assess regulations may subject us to penalties, fines and other actions which could materially affect our business.\nExaminations by relevant tax authorities may result in material changes in related tax reserves for tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets, such as net operating loss carry-forwards.\nBased on the outcome of examinations by relevant tax authorities, or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related tax reserves for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) in future periods. It is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.\nThere may be a negative effect to our business going forward because of changes to net neutrality.\nThe principle that Internet service providers should treat all Internet communications equally, and not charge users different rates for various tiers of service or prioritize certain traffic while blocking or slowing down others, is called net neutrality. On January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order that largely repealed prior FCC rules that prevented broadband internet access providers from degrading or otherwise disrupting a broad range of services provisioned over consumers\u2019 and enterprises\u2019 broadband internet access lines. Many of the largest providers of broadband services, like cable companies and traditional telephone companies, have publicly stated that they will not degrade or disrupt their customers\u2019 use of applications and services, like ours. However, there was no guarantee that they will not do so in the future. If such providers were to degrade, impair, or block our services, it would negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers, and we would likely lose revenue and profits. We would probably incur legal fees in an attempt to restore our customers\u2019 access to our services. Broadband internet access providers may also attempt to charge us or our customers additional fees to access services like ours that may result in the loss of customers and revenue, or increase our costs thereby reducing our profitability, or make our services less competitive if we increase our rates to our customers. President Biden and numerous Senators have criticized the current status of net neutrality, at this time we are not aware if there will be legislation that might reimpose the prior regulations.\nFollowing the adoption of the January 4, 2018 order, a number of states passed laws establishing rules similar to those that existed prior to the effective date of the January 4, 2018 order. However, we cannot rely on those state laws because of the uncertainty as to whether states have the authority to establish rules that could be interpreted to conflict with the January 4, 2018 order. The U.S. Department of Justice has taken the position that local authorities do not have the authority to contradict the FCC\u2019s January 4, 2018 order. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes.\nStates are adding regulation for VoIP providers which could increase our costs and change certain aspects of our service.\nCertain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers may include intrastate communications and should therefore be subject to state regulation including state taxes or surcharges. We have registered as an interconnected VoIP provider in those states where registration is required; however, our rates are not regulated in the same manner as traditional telephone service providers. We believe that the FCC has pre-empted states from regulating VoIP providers in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how this issue will be resolved or its impact on our business at this time.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes, and any such assessments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nJurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added, or similar taxes on VoIP services or other products may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, interest, or future requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, in June 2018, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states could impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers even if those sellers lack any physical presence within the states imposing the sales taxes. Under Wayfair, a person requires only a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with the taxing state before the state may subject the person to sales tax collection obligations therein. An increasing number of states (both before and after the publication of Wayfair) have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers. The Supreme Court\u2019s Wayfair decision has removed a significant impediment to the enactment and enforcement of these laws, and it is possible that states may seek to tax out-of-state sellers on sales that occurred in prior tax years, which could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if such states do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nHolders of our Class B common stock have significantly less voting power than holders of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to three votes per share. As a result, the ability of holders of our Class B common stock to influence our management is limited.\nEight trusts for the benefit of sons and daughters of Howard S. Jonas, our Chairman and Chairman of the Board, hold shares that, in the aggregate, represent more than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, which may limit the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nHoward S. Jonas serves as our Chairman, which is an executive officer position, and our Chairman of the Board, which is a Board of Directors position. As of October 12, 2022, eight trusts for the benefit of children of Howard S. Jonas (the \u201cTrusts\u201d), collectively have voting power over 1,574,326 shares of our Class A common stock, (which is all the issued and outstanding shares of the Class A common stock), which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 2,382,371 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 69.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, as of October 12, 2022. Each of the Trusts has a different, independent trustee. In addition, as of October 12, 2022, The HSJ 2020 IDT Annuity Trust holds 1,811,711 shares of our Class B common stock and The HSJ 2022 Annuity Trust holds 608,092 shares of our Class B common stock. Both of these trusts have an independent trustee.\nHoward S. Jonas does not have the right to direct or control the voting of the shares of our common stock that is held by the Trusts, and the independent trustees hold sole voting and dispositive power over the common stock held by the Trusts. However, he is the trustor of the trusts and is the father of each of the beneficiaries of the Trusts and his views may be taken into account by the trustees and others related to the Trusts. In addition, he is our founder and has served as an executive officer, including our Chief Executive Officer, for a very significant time period. The members of the Board and management often look to him for guidance on major financial, operational, and strategic matters.\nWe are not aware of any voting agreement between or among any of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas, but if such a voting agreement or other similar arrangement exists or were to be consummated, if all or several of the Trusts were to act in concert, or if we issued additional Class A common stock, certain or all of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas along with holders of the Class A common stock would be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors, amendment of organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management may be limited. In addition, our dual class structure has an anti-takeover effect, and accordingly, the holders of the shares of Class A common stock have the ability to prevent any change in control transactions that may otherwise be in the best interest of stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88988, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "IDT"}
