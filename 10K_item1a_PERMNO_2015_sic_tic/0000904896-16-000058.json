If we are unable to achieve profitable operations, we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and which will dilute our stockholders.\nSince 2000, we have experienced net losses and we have not been consistently profitable on an annual basis. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred net losses of $2.27 million and $1.76 million, respectively. We believe our history of net losses is primarily due to our inability to add enough new sources of revenue to replace decreasing business from existing sources of revenue and, more recently, through a shift of our business toward lower margin products and services. Further, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we experienced high expenses for non-cash share based compensation in addition to a material decrease in gross revenue. To achieve profitability, we must accomplish numerous objectives, including growth in our business, the development of new products and commercial relationships, and decreasing our costs. We can not foresee with any certainty whether we will be able to achieve these objectives in the future. Accordingly, we may not generate sufficient net revenue to achieve profitability, and we will need to raise additional capital.\nA significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers. Further, agreements with two of our largest customers were not renewed in 2014 and early 2016, and our failure to renew agreements has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur business depends on providing services to a limited number of customers. One or more of these customers may stop contracting for services from us or may substantially reduce the amount of services we provide them. Any cancellation, deferral or significant reduction in the services we provide these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business and financial condition. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our largest customer accounted for approximately 31% and 22% of our revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top three customers accounted for approximately 74% and 50%, respectively, of our revenues. Our sludge processing agreement with Toho Water Authority, which was our largest customer for the years 2011 through 2013 and represented approximately 42% of our revenues in 2013, was not renewed at the beginning of 2014. Our sludge processing agreement with Altamonte Springs, which was our largest customer in 2014 and our second largest customer in 2015, representing approximately 29% of our revenues, was not renewed effective April 2016. Our failure to renew that agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Additionally, regional economic considerations have made the supply of admixtures used in our processes more difficult to acquire due to coal-burning facilities operating less or not at all for unusually long periods of time.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nWe have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We have previously identified a material\nweakness in our internal controls over financial reporting due to a lack of personnel to sufficiently monitor and process transactions. Due to our continuing lack of financial resources to hire and train accounting and financial personnel, we have not yet remedied this material weakness. At the beginning of 2012, as part of continued cost-cutting measures, we laid off one of our financial personnel that reported directly to the Chief Financial Officer. While we are not aware of any material errors to date, our inability to maintain the adequate internal controls may result in a material error in our financial statements. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we experience a material error in our financial statements or if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may reduce, delay or prevent our realization of license revenues and/or facility revenue.\nOur operations and our licensees and their operations are subject to increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing the emission, discharge, disposal and transportation of certain substances and related odor. Wastewater treatment plants and other plants at which our biosolids products or processes may be implemented are usually required to have permits, registrations and/or approvals from state and/or local governments for the operation of such facilities. Some facilities using our processes require air, wastewater, storm water, biosolids processing, use or siting permits, registrations or approvals. These licensees may not be able to maintain or renew their current permits or registrations or to obtain new permits or registrations. The process of obtaining a required permit or registration can be lengthy and expensive. They may not be able to meet applicable regulatory or permit requirements, and therefore may be subject to related legal or judicial proceedings that could have a materially adverse effect on our income derived from these facilities.\nAny of the permits, registrations or approvals noted above, or related applications may be subject to denial, revocation or modification, or challenge by a third party, under various circumstances. In addition, if new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are enforced differently, these facilities may be required to obtain additional, or modify existing, operating permits, registrations or approvals.\nMaintaining, modifying or renewing current permits or registrations or obtaining new permits or registrations after new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or enforced differently may be subject to public opposition or challenge. Much of this public opposition and challenge, as well as related complaints, relates to odor issues, even when a facility is operated in compliance with odor requirements and even though they have worked hard to minimize odor from their operations. Public misperceptions about the business and any related odor could influence the governmental process for issuing such permits or registrations or for responding to any such public opposition or challenge. Community groups could pressure local municipalities or state governments to implement laws and regulations which could increase our costs of their operations that in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to grow our revenues and operations may be limited by competition.\nWe provide a variety of technology and services relating to the treatment of wastewater residuals. We are in direct and indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services including regional residuals management companies and national and international water and wastewater operations/privatization companies, technology suppliers, municipal solid waste companies and farming operations. Many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater capital resources.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from services provided under municipal contracts, and many of these are subject to competitive bidding. We also intend to bid on additional municipal contracts, however, and may not be the successful bidder. In addition, some of our contracts will expire in the future and those contracts may not be renewed or may be renewed on less attractive terms. In 2014 and in 2015, we experienced this possibility with respect to existing and material contracts in Florida which were not renewed. If we are not able to replace revenues from contracts lost through competitive bidding or from the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenues within a reasonable time period, the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur customer contracts may be terminated prior to the expiration of their term.\nAlmost all of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and agreements with existing licensees and customers. Some of these contracts, especially those contracts with large municipalities, provide for termination of the contract by the customer after giving relative short notice (in some cases as little as ten days). In addition, some of these contracts may contain liquidated damages clauses, which may or may not be enforceable in the event of early termination of the contracts. If one or more of these contracts are terminated prior to the expiration of its term, and we are not able to replace revenues from the terminated contract or receive liquidated damages pursuant to the terms of the contract, the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic downturn may cause us to experience delays of payment from our customers.\nOur accounts receivable are derived primarily from municipal or local governments. Although our collection history has been good, from time to time a customer may not pay us on a timely basis because of adverse market or local government conditions. In light of an economic downturn, we may experience larger than expected delays in receiving payments on our accounts receivable. Given our history of losses and our limited cash resources, any significant payment delay by one of our customers may force us to delay payment to our creditors, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are affected by unusually adverse weather conditions.\nOur present business is adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application sites in close proximity to our operations. In addition, revenues and operational results are adversely affected during months of inclement weather which limits the amount of land application that can be performed. Long periods of adverse weather could have a material negative effect on our business and financial condition. For example, our Florida operation is sometimes affected by unusually adverse weather conditions by lowering the demand for N-Viro Soil(TM) distribution to the local agricultural community.\nFuel cost variation could adversely affect our operating results and expenses.\nThe price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including demand for oil and gas, actions by oil and gas producers and war in oil producing countries. Because fuel is needed for the trucks that transport the processing materials and supplies for our operations and customers, price escalations or reductions in the supply of fuel could increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on the results of operations. We are not always able to pass through all or part of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain customers' contracts and the inability to negotiate such pass through costs in a timely manner.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our management team, the loss of any of whom may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn 2010 we entered into employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Kasmoch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel, Robert Bohmer and our Chief Financial Officer, James McHugh, each of which contains non-compete and other provisions. The laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of non-competition agreements. We cannot predict with certainty whether or not a court will enforce a non-compete covenant in any given situation based on the facts and circumstances at that time. If one of our key executive officers were to leave our employ and the courts refused to enforce the non-compete covenant, we might be subject to increased competition, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition. All of our management employment agreements had a stated initial term expiration in March 2015. The agreements were each extended for an additional one (1) year term automatically in March 2015 and 2016, pursuant to the terms of the respective agreements.\nOur intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as the use of non-disclosure and licensing agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to offer services.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected.\nThere is only a limited trading market for our common stock, and it is possible that you may not be able to sell your shares easily.\nThere is currently only a limited trading market for our common stock. Our common stock trades on the OTCQB, which is one of the quotation services for SEC-registered and reporting companies that trade over the counter (\"OTC Markets\"), under the symbol \u201cNVIC\u201d, with limited trading volume. We cannot assure you that a trading market will continue to exist for our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our shares of common stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock heretofore, and we have no present intention of paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors.\nVolatility in the trading price of our common stock could negatively impact the price of our common stock, and may eliminate a source of our potential revenue from exercises of stock options and stock purchase warrants.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2014 through April 4, 2016, our common stock closing price fluctuated between a high of $2.75 and a low of $0.57. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the thinly-traded nature of our common stock and the outlook of analysts and investors on our industry. Further, significant market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Over the past several years, we have relied on, in part, private placements of stock, exercises of stock options by current and former officers and directors, and, exercises of stock purchase warrants by investors for operating cash. Wide fluctuations in the price of our common stock or a stock price that is not significantly above the exercise price of outstanding stock options or warrants would likely reduce future exercises of stock options or warrants, and which would reduce or eliminate a historic source of cash for our operations.", "PERMNO": 79723, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "NVIC"}
