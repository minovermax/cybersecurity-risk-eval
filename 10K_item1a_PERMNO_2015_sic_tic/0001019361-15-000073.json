RISK FACTORS\nTHE GLOBAL ECONOMY, CAPITAL MARKETS, CREDIT DISRUPTIONS AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur business, operating results, or financial condition can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, which could in turn affect our stock price. These macroeconomic factors include, but are not limited to, consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, global factory production and credit market conditions. Additionally, changes in the political environment in the markets in which we operate can adversely impact our business, such as foreign exchange import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers and price or exchange controls.\nDOWNTURNS IN THE INDUSTRIES WE SERVE, PARTICULARLY IN THE MACHINE TOOL, AUTOMOTIVE, SEMICONDUCTOR, ELECTRONICS AND PHOTOVOLTAIC INDUSTRIES, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY.\nOur business depends substantially upon capital expenditures particularly by manufacturers in the machine tool, automotive (and sub-suppliers), semiconductor, electronics and photovoltaic industries. Approximately 70% of our laser sales during fiscal year 2015 were to these industry markets. These industries are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment, including the products manufactured and marketed by us. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures in these industries, which, in turn, depend upon the market demand for their products. Decreased demand from manufacturers in these industries, for example, during an economic downturn, may lead to decreased demand for our products. Although such decreased demand would reduce our sales, we may not be able to reduce expenses quickly, due in part to the need for continual investment in research and development and the need to maintain our extensive ongoing customer service and support capability. Although we order materials for assembly in response to firm orders, the lead time for assembly and delivery of some of our products creates a risk that we may incur expenditures or purchase inventories for products which we cannot sell.\nAccordingly, any economic downturn or slowdown in the machine tool, automotive, semiconductor, electronics or photovoltaic industries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OUR SALES ARE OVERSEAS AND OUR RESULTS ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.\nAlthough we report our results in U.S. dollars, approximately 67% of our current sales are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Swedish krona, Swiss francs, British pound, Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, Korean won, Taiwanese dollar, Canadian dollar, Indian rupee, and Chinese RMB. The fluctuation of the Euro, and the other functional currencies, against the U.S. dollar has had the effect of increasing and decreasing (as applicable) reported net sales as well as cost of goods sold, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into U.S. dollars as compared to prior periods.\nWe also face transaction risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between the various currencies in which we do business. We believe that a certain portion of the transaction risk of our operations in multiple currencies is mitigated by our hedging activities, utilizing forward exchange contracts and forward exchange options. We also continue to borrow in many of our operating subsidiaries' functional currencies to reduce exposure to exchange gains and losses. However, there can be no assurance that changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOUR INABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nOur products are currently marketed in approximately 70 countries, with the United States, Germany, the rest of Europe and the Asia/Pacific region being our principal markets. Our operations and sales in our principal markets are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including:\n\u2022\nthe general political and economic conditions in each such country or region;\n\u2022\noverlap of differing tax structures;\n\u2022\nclimatic or other natural disasters in regions where we operate;\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping costs or increases in fuel costs;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nmanagement of an organization spread over various jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export licensing requirements, trade restrictions, currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings.\nAny failure to manage the risks associated with our international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by economic slowdowns in the United States, Europe or the Asia/Pacific region. A recession in these economies could trigger a decline in laser sales to the machine tool, automotive, semiconductor, electronics or photovoltaic industries, and any related weaknesses in their respective currencies could adversely affect customer demand for our products, the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales, and ultimately our consolidated results of operations.\nWe also are subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, we face additional risks that our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services, because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct.\nOUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX IMPORT AND EXPORT RULES THAT VARY AMONG THE LEGAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Depending on its size and scope, any of these penalties could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWE DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF OUR OEM CUSTOMERS TO INCORPORATE OUR LASER PRODUCTS INTO THEIR SYSTEMS.\nOur sales depend in part upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our laser products. Adverse economic conditions, inadequate liquidity, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors affecting these OEM customers could subject us to risks of business failure by such customers and potential credit and inventory risks, and thus could have a substantial impact upon our financial results. We cannot provide assurances that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our financial condition or results of operations.\nWE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST, AND EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE, FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience some fluctuations in our quarterly results. We believe that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market prices of our common stock, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors which may have an influence on the Company\u2019s operating results in a particular quarter include:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic uncertainties;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for, and sales of, our products or prolonged downturns in the industries that we serve;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the receipt of orders from major customers;\n\u2022\nproduct mix;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nthe relative proportions of domestic and international sales;\n\u2022\nour ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on a cost-effective and timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe delayed effect of incurrence of expenses to develop and improve marketing and service capabilities;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nability of our suppliers to produce and deliver components and parts, including sole or limited source components, in a timely manner, in the quantity desired and at the prices we have budgeted;\n\u2022\nour ability to control expenses; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions of businesses.\nThese and other factors make it difficult for us to release precise predictions regarding the development and financial results of our business. In addition, current conditions in the domestic and global economies are uncertain, i.e. currently in Asia, especially in China. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole or of capital expenditures in the industrial markets we serve. Because all of the components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of spending within these markets, the prevailing economic uncertainty renders estimates of future revenue and expenses even more difficult than usual to make. In addition, our backlog at any given time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. As our delivery schedule typically ranges from one week to six months, our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received. Moreover, customers may cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. See also \u201cBusiness - Order Backlog\u201d.\nOther factors that we believe may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, include announcements of new products, technologies, or customers by us or our competitors, developments with respect to intellectual property, and shortfalls in our operations relative to analysts\u2019 expectations. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and the shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced wide price fluctuations. These broad market and industry fluctuations, particularly in the semiconductor, electronics, photovoltaics, machine tool and automotive industries,\nmay adversely affect the market prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nTHE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCREASED COMPETITION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, REDUCE OUR SALES OR CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE.\nThe laser industry is characterized by significant price and technical competition. Our current and proposed laser products for macro, marking and micro applications, and components, compete with those of several well-established companies, some of which are larger and have substantially greater financial, managerial and technical resources, more extensive distribution and service networks and larger installed customer bases than us.\nWe believe that competition will be particularly intense in the solid-state, fiber, CO2 and diode laser markets, as many companies have committed significant research and development resources to pursue opportunities in these markets. There can be no assurance that we will successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors or that the marketplace will consider our products to be superior to competing products. Because many of the components required to develop and produce a laser-based marking system are commercially available, barriers to entry into this market are relatively low, and we expect new competitive product entries in this market. To maintain our competitive position in these markets, we believe that we will be required to continue a high level of investment in engineering, research and development, marketing, and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position, or that our products will receive market acceptance. See also \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d.\nOUR FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS TO MEET MARKET DEMAND AND TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE FOR LASER MACRO AND MARKING AND MICRO PRODUCTS.\nIf we are to increase our laser sales in the near term, these sales will have to come through increases in market share for our existing products, through the development of new products, or through the acquisition of competitors or their products. To date, a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from sales of high-powered solid-state lasers, fiber lasers, CO2 laser sources and diode lasers. In order to increase market demand for these products, we will need to devote substantial resources to:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to broaden our fiber, solid-sate, CO2 and diode laser product range;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to increase the output power and vary the laser wavelengths of our product portfolio; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to reduce the manufacturing costs of our product range to achieve more attractive pricing.\nA large part of our growth strategy depends upon being able to increase our worldwide market share for laser macro, marking and micro products.\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers\u2019 needs and develop products that address those needs. Our ability to control costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development. If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new and enhanced products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that any of the newly developed or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance or not be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by products of other companies. See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness - The Company\u2019s Laser Products\u201d.\nWE DEPEND ON OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND SKILLED PERSONNEL TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKET, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN EXISTING OR HIRE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WHEN NEEDED, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE HARMED.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level. These key employees include engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support\npersonnel for our operations on a worldwide basis. Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult. At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. If we fail to attract additional employees or lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\nRECENT CHANGES IN OUR EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY BE DISRUPTIVE TO, OR CAUSE UNCERTAINTY IN, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nEffective on July 1, 2015, Thomas Merk succeeded G\u00fcnther Braun as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and at the same time Mr. Merk replaced Mr. Braun as a member of the Board of Directors. In addition to these changes, we have also recently implemented a broader senior management team. These changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business. In addition, the departure of Mr. Braun, and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees, could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE NEW OPERATIONS OR INTEGRATE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO SUFFER.\nAn important part of our growth strategy is making strategic acquisitions of companies with complementary operations, technologies or products. We regularly review potential acquisitions and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions. We may be unable to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In connection with future acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. Any debt that we incur to pay for future acquisition could contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we operate our business. Any new equity securities that we issue for this purpose would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we buy a company or a division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating that company or division\u2019s personnel and operations, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nIn addition:\n\u2022\nthe key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\nwe may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;\n\u2022\nwe may be held liable for risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to realize the synergies, cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.\nPRODUCTION DIFFICULTIES AND PRODUCT DELIVERY DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nWe manufacture and test our products at our facilities in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Singapore. If use of any of our manufacturing facilities were interrupted by a natural disaster or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of:\n\u2022\nmistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations;\n\u2022\nchanging process technologies;\n\u2022\nramping production;\n\u2022\ninstalling new equipment at our manufacturing facilities; and\n\u2022\nshortage of key components.\nIn addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain customers.\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AND ANY FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT PROFITABILITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS AND COST REDUCTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented various profitability enhancement and cost reduction initiatives, including the efficiency and cost reduction programs that we announced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. These initiatives include evaluating the manufacturing of some products in lower cost regions, the consolidation of various facilities and operations, transitioning higher-cost external supply to internal manufacturing, working with our material suppliers to further lower costs, evaluation the appropriate business staffing levels and streamlining our overhead.\nWe cannot be sure that our cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented, or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability. The cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. Even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business.\nIF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY FORECAST COMPONENT AND MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS.\nWe use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials. Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms, and current market demand for components. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least a nine-month lead time. If we\nover estimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers. Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business, or operating results.\nWE DEPEND ON LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS THAT COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL MANUFACTURING DELAYS AND INCREASE OUR COSTS IF A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY OCCURS.\nWe estimate that 8% of our revenues in fiscal 2015 were derived from sales of products that require specialized components only available from single sources. We also rely on a limited number of independent contractors to manufacture subassemblies\nfor some of our products. There can be no assurance that, in the future, our current or alternative sources will be able to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, or if they fail to meet any of our manufacturing requirements, our business could be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any. If we are unable to find necessary parts or components on commercially reasonable terms, we could be required to reengineer our products to accommodate available substitutions which could increase our costs and/or have a material adverse effect on manufacturing schedules, product performance and market acceptance.\nThe manufacturing of our solid-state lasers require elements of rare earth in small quantities. Shortages of these elements, delays in their delivery and resulting increases of the market price for such materials might have an adverse effect on our production costs.\nIF OUR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets, subject to amortization, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flow projections. A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge. Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.\nWE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF A PROXY FIGHT.\nIn October 2015, we received notice from SilverArrow Capital Advisors LLP, SilverArrow Capital Holding Ltd., SAC Jupiter Holding Ltd., Pluto Fund Limited, Thomas Limberger, Robert Schimanko, Abdullah Saleh A. Kamel, Osama H. Al Sayed and Ernesto Palomba (collectively \u201cSliverArrow\u201d) (which reports that it owns over 9% of our common stock) declaring its intention to nominate three new independent directors at the Company\u2019s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. A proxy contest could negatively affect us because: responding to proxy contests, litigation and other actions by dissident shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees; perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may divert the attention of, damage morale and create instability among our business partners, management, and employees and adversely impact our existing and potential strategic and operational relationships and opportunities; we may experience difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating personnel during the resulting uncertain and turbulent times; if individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; increases in legal fees, administrative and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to a proxy contest and related litigation could be substantial; and a proxy contest, or the threat of one, could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO LAWSUITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products. While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits. We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nANY DEFECTS IN OUR PRODUCTS OR CUSTOMER PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND REPUTATION.\nOur laser products are technologically complex and may contain both known and undetected errors or performance problems. In addition, performance problems can also be caused by the improper installation or use of our products by a customer. These errors or performance problems could result in customer dissatisfaction, which could harm our sales or customer relationships. In addition, these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts.\nTHE LONG SALES CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES WITHOUT OFFSETTING REVENUES.\nCustomers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle. While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customer's needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order. Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products. As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenue to offset such expenses.\nOUR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY OR TO AVOID LITIGATION FOR INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF REVENUES AND PROFITS.\nOur future success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products.\nWe currently hold 262 United States and foreign patents on our laser sources and laser applications, with expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2034. We have also obtained licenses under certain patents covering lasers and related technology incorporated into our products. In addition, 204 patent applications have been filed and are under review by the relevant patent authorities. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to ours, that any patents will issue from any application filed by us or that, if patents do issue, the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, there can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights thereunder will provide a competitive advantage to us. See also \u201cBusiness - Intellectual Property\u201d.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties\u2019 patent or other proprietary rights by our products. While these notices are common in the laser industry and we have in the past been able to develop non-infringing technology or license necessary patents or technology on commercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that we would in the future prevail in any litigation seeking damages or expenses from us or to enjoin us from selling products on the basis of such alleged infringement, or that we would be able to develop any non-infringing technology or license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms. In the event any third party made a valid claim against us or our customers and a license was not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be adversely affected.\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS OR OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR INCREASE OUR EXPENSES.\nWe are subject to many governmental regulations, including but not limited to the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the United States Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end users, and to certify and label our products. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement remedies, in the markets we serve.\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be\nmanufactured. The new rule, which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires annual disclosure reports to be filed with the SEC, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tungsten, tantalum and/or gold. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nAny significant change in the regulations described in the paragraphs above could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCHANGES IN TAX RATES, TAX LIABILITIES OR TAX ACCOUNTING RULES COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we do business. Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of the income tax returns that we and our subsidiaries file by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIF WE EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN, OR BREACH IN SECURITY OF, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial information. Events could result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, computer attacks by hackers, viruses, catastrophes, hardware and software failures, and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of system disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.", "PERMNO": 83961, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "RSTI"}
