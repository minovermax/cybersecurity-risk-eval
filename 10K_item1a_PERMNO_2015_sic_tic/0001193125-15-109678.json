{"cik": "1528849", "company": "Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGrowth in our business may not be sustained and may not generate a corresponding improvement in our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve the levels of growth that we have experienced in the recent past. In addition, although we have recently experienced strong comparable brand revenue growth, if our future comparable brand revenue growth fails to meet market expectations or decline, the price of our common stock could decline. Various factors affect this measure, including the number, size and location of stores we open, close, remodel or expand in any period, the overall economic and general retail sales environment, consumer preferences and demand, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our product offerings, competition, current local and global economic conditions, changes in Source Book circulation and the success of marketing programs. These factors may cause our comparable brand revenue growth to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nAlthough we experienced sustained sales growth over the last several years, this sales growth may not continue or may not continue at the same rate and the level of our sales growth may slow or even decrease in future periods and may vary from year to year, including if the favorable customer response to our product offerings is not sustained. Many factors can influence customer response to our product offerings and store formats including responses from our competitors, who may introduce similar products or merchandise formats. In addition, sales levels for particular merchandise or product categories may not continue over time if customer demand levels are not sustained. The level of customer response to our next generation Galleries may vary in different markets and store locations. Similarly, the level of customer response to our Source Book format, in which we display a greater percentage of our product assortment, may vary in different markets. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to migrate customer demand successfully when we choose to close a store in a particular location in favor of a next generation Gallery in the same or an adjacent market location. While our objective is to retain a high percentage of customer demand from store locations that we close, there can be no assurance that we will retain a high percentage of sales from stores closed in the future or that we will continue to retain a high percentage of sales from stores previously closed.\nIn addition, these developments in our business could result in material changes in our operating costs, including increased merchandise inventory costs and costs for paper and postage associated with the mailing and shipping of Source Books and products. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in offsetting these expenses with increased efficiency or that cost increases associated with our business will not have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we fail to successfully anticipate consumer preferences and demand, or to manage our inventory commensurate with demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a\nrange of consumers whose preferences cannot always be predicted with certainty. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop products that customers positively respond to or that we will successfully meet consumer demands in the future. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify or respond effectively to consumer preferences and demand could adversely affect sales of our products. If this occurs, our sales may decline significantly, and we may be required to mark down certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory or to sell such inventory through our outlet stores, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we must manage our merchandise in stock and inventory levels to track consumer demand. Much of our merchandise requires that we provide vendors with significant ordering lead time, frequently before market factors are known. In addition, the seasonal nature of some of our products requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to certain selling seasons. If we are not able to anticipate consumer demand for our different product offerings, or successfully manage inventory levels for products that are in demand, we may experience:\n\u2022\nback orders, order cancellations and lost sales for products that are in high demand for which we did not stock adequate inventory; and\n\u2022\noverstock inventory levels for products that have lower consumer demand, requiring us to take markdowns or other steps to sell slower-moving merchandise.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases.\nChanges in consumer spending or the housing market may significantly harm our revenue and results of operations.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending in the retail home furnishings sector, including, among other things, the general state of the economy, capital and credit markets, consumer confidence, general business conditions, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the level of consumer debt, interest rates, level of taxes affecting consumers, housing prices, new construction and other activity in the housing sector and the state of the mortgage industry and other aspects of consumer credit tied to housing, including the availability and pricing of mortgage refinancings and home equity lines of credit. We believe that a number of these factors have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the retail home furnishings sector, and have also affected our business and results, and these factors may make it difficult for us to accurately predict our operating and financial results for future periods. We believe that the housing market has been experiencing a recovery after a prolonged downtrend, and rising levels of home purchases and remodelings, in turn, have increased consumer spending on home furnishings. However, the overall economic outlook remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that any economic or housing recovery will be sustained or that our business will continue to perform well even in a stronger housing market.\nOur growth strategy and performance depend on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices, including our products that are produced by artisans and specialty vendors, and any disruptions we experience in our ability to obtain our products in a timely fashion or in the quantities required could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We instead purchase all of our merchandise from a large number of vendors, many of which are the sole sources for particular products. Our growth strategy includes expanding the amount of products we sell, and our performance depends on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. However, many of our key products are produced by artisans, specialty vendors and other vendors that may have limited production capacity. In addition, some of our vendors are small and undercapitalized firms. A number of our vendors, particularly our artisan vendors, may\nhave limited resources, production capacities and operating histories. As a result, the capacity of some of our vendors to meet our supply requirements has been, and may in the future be, constrained at various times and our vendors may be susceptible to production difficulties or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their production during future periods. A disruption in the ability of our significant vendors to access liquidity could also cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their ability to manufacture or ship products to us.\nAny difficulties that we experience in our ability to obtain products in sufficient quality and quantity from our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business. In fiscal 2014, we sourced approximately 90% of our merchandise abroad. Our ability to obtain desired merchandise in sufficient quantities could be impaired by events that adversely affect our vendors or the locations in which they operate, such as difficulties or problems associated with our vendors\u2019 operations, business, finances, labor, economic and political environment (including the impact of war, rebellion or any other conflicts), importation of products, costs, production, insurance and reputation. Failure of vendors to produce adequate quantities of merchandise in a timely manner has resulted in back orders, order cancelations, increased freight costs and lower revenue in certain periods of our business operation. While we believe our vendors have the capacity to meet our demand, we cannot assure you that our vendors will be able to produce adequate quantities of merchandise in a timely manner in the future.\nWe also do not have long-term contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products with our vendors, and generally we transact business with our vendors on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time. Any disruptions we experience in our ability to obtain our products in a timely fashion or in the quantities required could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to locate and develop relationships with a sufficient number of new vendors, which could lead to product shortages and customer backorders, which could harm our business.\nIn the event that one or more of our vendors is unable to meet the quantity or quality of our product requirements, we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors in a manner that is sufficient to supply the shortfall. Even if we do identify such new vendors, we may experience product shortages and customer backorders as we transition our product requirements to incorporate the alternative suppliers. In addition, we cannot assure you that any new vendor with which we do business, particularly any new vendor abroad, would not be subject to the same or similar quality and quantity risks as our existing suppliers.\nWe do not have exclusive relationships with most of our vendors, and there is a risk that our vendors may sell similar or identical products to our competitors, which could harm our business.\nOur arrangements with our vendors are generally not exclusive. As a result, most of our vendors might be able to sell similar or identical products to certain of our competitors, some of which purchase products in significantly greater volume. Our competitors may enter into arrangements with suppliers that could impair our ability to sell those suppliers\u2019 products, including by requiring suppliers to enter into exclusive arrangements, which could limit our access to such arrangements or products. Our vendors could also initiate or expand sales of their products through their own stores or through the Internet to the retail market and therefore compete with us directly or sell their products through outlet centers or discount stores, increasing the competitive pricing pressure we face.\nDefective merchandise purchased from our vendors could damage our reputation and brand image and harm our business, and we may not have adequate remedies against our vendors for defective merchandise.\nIf products that we purchase from vendors are damaged or prove to be defective, we may not be able to return products to these vendors and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain other indemnification from them. Our vendors\u2019 limited capacities may result in a vendor\u2019s inability to replace any defective merchandise in a\ntimely manner. In addition, our vendors\u2019 limited capitalization or liquidity may mean that a vendor that has supplied defective merchandise will not be able to refund the purchase price to us or pay us any penalties or damages associated with any defects.\nIn addition, our vendors may not adhere to our quality control standards, and we might not identify a quality deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers. Our vendors\u2019 failure to manufacture or import quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brand image, and could lead to an increase in product returns or exchanges or customer litigation against us and a corresponding increase in our routine and non-routine litigation costs. Further, any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards or other government requirements could become subject to a recall, which could damage our reputation and brand image and harm our business.\nA number of factors that affect our ability to successfully open new stores within the time frames we initially target or optimize our store footprint are beyond our control, and these factors may harm our ability to execute our strategy of sizing stores to the potential of the market, which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe are focused on sizing our assortments and our stores to the potential of the market by adjusting the square footage and number of stores on a geographic market-by-market basis. We plan to optimize our real estate by continuing to open larger square footage Galleries in key markets and relocating or closing selected stores in these or adjacent markets. When we address the introduction of new stores in a particular market or changes to, or closure of, existing stores, we must make a series of decisions regarding the size and location of new stores (or the existing stores slated to undergo changes or closure) and the impact on our other existing stores in the area.\nOur ability to maximize the productivity of our retail store base, depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable locations, the availability of which is largely outside of our control;\n\u2022\nsize the store locations to the market opportunity;\n\u2022\nretain customers in certain geographic markets when we close stores in that market;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable new lease terms or lease renewals, modifications or terminations;\n\u2022\nefficiently build and equip new stores or further remodel existing locations;\n\u2022\nsource sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of changes in our store footprint on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate changes in our store base into our existing operations and information technology systems;\n\u2022\nobtain or maintain adequate capital resources on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\navoid construction or local permit delays and cost overruns in connection with the opening of new stores or the expansion or further remodeling of existing stores;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate distribution facilities, information systems and other operational systems to serve our new stores and remodeled stores; and\n\u2022\naddress competitive, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into new geographic areas and markets.\nWe have experienced delays in opening some new stores within the time frames we initially targeted, and may continue to experience such delays in the future. Any of these challenges could delay or prevent us from completing store openings or the additional remodeling of existing stores or hinder the operations of stores we\nopen or remodel. If any of these challenges delays the opening of a store, our results of operations will be negatively affected as we will incur leasing and other costs during the delay without associated store revenue at such location. New or remodeled stores may not be profitable or achieve our target return on investment. Unfavorable economic and business conditions and other events could also interfere with our plans to expand or modify store footprints. Our failure to effectively address challenges such as those listed above could adversely affect our ability to successfully open new stores or change our store footprint in a timely and cost-effective manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nThe success of our business depends upon the continued service of our key personnel, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman. The loss of the services of our key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our key personnel. As a result, we may not be able to cover the financial loss we may incur in losing the services of any of our key personnel.\nMr. Friedman\u2019s equity ownership in our Company has given him a substantial amount of personal wealth. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate him, and this wealth could affect his decisions about whether or not he will continue to perform services for us. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating Mr. Friedman, we may be unable to achieve our historical growth rates.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail industry is intense. We may be unable to retain other existing personnel that are important to our business or hire additional qualified personnel. The process of locating personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, marketing and sales personnel, and store managers, and upon the continued contributions of these people. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified executives and personnel.\nIn addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store employees who understand and appreciate our corporate culture and customers. Turnover in the retail industry is generally high. Excessive store employee turnover will result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. If we are unable to hire and retain store personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our ability to open new stores may be impaired, the performance of our existing and new stores could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted.\nOur operations have significant liquidity and capital requirements and depend on the availability of adequate financing on reasonable terms, and if we are unable to borrow sufficient capital, it could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nOur operations have significant liquidity and capital requirements. Among other things, we have invested significant capital expenditures in remodeling and opening new Galleries and these capital expenditures have increased and will continue to increase in fiscal 2015 and succeeding fiscal periods as we open additional next generation Galleries, which may require us to undertake upgrades to historical buildings or construction of new buildings. During fiscal 2014, we spent $110.4 million for capital expenditures. Additionally, we made payments of $9.3 million in fiscal 2014 to escrow accounts for future construction of certain next generation Galleries. We anticipate our gross capital expenditures to be approximately $140 million to $160 million for fiscal 2015, which we anticipate to be offset by approximately $10 million to $20 million due to landlord contributions and other capital inflows related to our real estate transformation and portfolio. We plan to continue our growth and expansion, including opening next generation Galleries in select major metropolitan markets, pursuing category extensions of our brand, and exploring new business areas. We own the building and land for our Gallery in San\nFrancisco, but to date we have principally relied upon leases with landlords for our other locations. As we develop new Galleries in the future, we may explore other models for our real estate which could include joint ventures or other forms of equity ownership in the real estate interests associated with new sites and buildings. These approaches might require greater capital investment than a traditional store lease with a landlord.\nWe have generally depended on our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities, as well as revolving borrowings under the Restoration Hardware, Inc. revolving line of credit and other sources of additional external funding, to finance the carrying costs of our inventory, to pay for capital expenditures and operating expenses and to support our growth strategy. If the cash flows from our operating activities are not sufficient to finance the carrying costs of inventory and to pay for capital expenditures and operating costs, and if we do not otherwise have sufficient cash on hand or are unable to borrow a sufficient amount under the revolving line of credit to finance or pay for such expenditures and costs, it could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had no amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit and had $401.3 million available for borrowing. Various factors may impact our lenders\u2019 willingness to provide funds to us, including:\n\u2022\nour continuing compliance with the terms of our revolving line of credit;\n\u2022\nthe amount of availability under the revolving line of credit, which depends on various factors, including the amount of collateral available under the revolving line of credit, which relies on a borrowing base formula tied principally to the value of our assets, including our inventory; and\n\u2022\nour lenders\u2019 financial strength and ability to perform under the revolving line of credit.\nWe currently believe that our cash flow from operations, net cash proceeds available to us from the issuance of the convertible senior notes and funds available under the revolving line of credit will satisfy our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months. However, any weakening of, or other adverse developments concerning our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under the revolving line of credit, could limit the overall amount of funds available to us.\nIn addition, we may experience cash flow shortfalls in the future, and we may otherwise require additional external funding, or we may need to raise funds to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, to make acquisitions of other businesses or companies or to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds on favorable terms, if at all, or that future financing requirements would not be dilutive to holders of our capital stock. If we fail to raise sufficient additional funds, we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nOur quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, promotional events, store openings, shifts in the timing of holidays and timing of Source Book releases, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nOur results of operation vary relative to corresponding periods in prior years. We may take certain pricing, merchandising or marketing actions that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season. For example, we periodically engage in sales promotional activities that may disproportionately impact results in a particular quarter and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nOur business depends in part on a strong brand image. We continue to invest in the development of our brand and the marketing of our business, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand or market our product offerings, we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of our products.\nWe believe that the brand image we have developed, and the lifestyle image associated with our brand, have contributed significantly to the success of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is integral to our business and to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. This will require us to continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for store operations, Source Book mailings, website operations and employee training. Our brand image may be diminished if new products, services or other businesses fail to maintain or enhance our distinctive brand image. Furthermore, our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise and service quality, if we fail to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe are exploring opportunities to expand into new categories or complementary businesses. If we are not successful in these new categories or business areas, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nWe are engaged in ongoing efforts to explore new business opportunities that we believe can leverage our current business platform. We have developed a number of new product categories and extensions over the last several years, including Contemporary Art, Outdoor & Garden, Baby & Child and Small Spaces. We also have introduced other merchandise categories that enhance the customer experience in our Galleries, including fresh cut flowers, magazines and tea and a wine bar. We plan further brand-enhancing offerings, such as a caf\u00e9 or restaurant adjacent to, or inside of, select next generation Galleries. We are incubating a number of other new ideas for potential expansion of our business, some of which may become new core categories or new store concepts and others of which may be primarily offered as enrichment of the customer experience.\nDeveloping and testing new business opportunities will involve us in business operations and areas of expertise that would be new to our organization and may require management time and resources. We may not achieve wide market acceptance or generate revenue sufficient to recoup the cost of developing and operating such new concepts, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any new businesses we enter may expose us to additional laws, regulations and risks, including the risk that we may incur ongoing operating expenses in such businesses in excess of revenues, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. The financial profile of any such new businesses may be different than our current financial profile, which could affect our financial performance and the market price for our common stock.\nWe are undertaking a large number of business initiatives at the same time and if these new initiatives are not successful, they may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe are experiencing rapid growth and undertaking a large number of new business initiatives. For example, we have developed and continue to refine and enhance our Gallery format which involves larger store square footage. We plan to continue to open larger format Galleries in select major metropolitan markets and we expect to close a number of our older stores and replace them with the next generation Gallery format. We also continue to add new product categories and to expand product assortments. For example, we introduced our new Tableware category in Spring 2013. We are currently contemplating other new product lines and extensions and complementary brand-enhancing businesses, as well as expanding sales to international markets. In addition, we are continuing a number of new initiatives in other areas of our business, including product sourcing and distribution and management information systems. For example, we have reduced the use of third-party buying agents in most foreign locations. Further, our Source Book strategy continues to evolve. We may incur costs for these new initiatives before we realize any corresponding revenue.\nThe number of current business initiatives could strain our financial, operational and management resources. In addition, these initiatives may not be successful. If we are not successful in managing our current growth and the large number of new initiatives that are underway, we might experience an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations. All of the foregoing risks may be compounded in any economic downturn. If we fail to achieve the intended results of our current business initiatives, or if the implementation of these initiatives is delayed or abandoned, diverts management\u2019s attention or resources from other aspects of our business or costs more than anticipated, we may experience inadequate return on investment for some of our business initiatives, which would have a negative effect on our operating results.\nIn 2013, Gary Friedman was re-appointed as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. There can be no assurance that this transition will not have an adverse impact on us.\nEffective July 2, 2013, Gary Friedman was appointed to serve as our Co-Chief Executive Officer along with Carlos Alberini, and Mr. Friedman is now serving as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Friedman also serves as Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Friedman previously served as Chairman and as Co-Chief Executive Officer with Mr. Alberini from June 2010 through October 2012. Prior to June 2010, Mr. Friedman was our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. In October 2012, Mr. Friedman resigned as Co-Chief Executive Officer and as a director and agreed to serve in an advisory capacity as our Creator and Curator following an investigation by a special committee of non-management directors of the board assisted by independent counsel prompted by disclosure that Mr. Friedman and a Company employee were engaged in a personal relationship, described by the parties as consensual. The investigation concluded that Mr. Friedman engaged in activities that were inconsistent with the board of directors\u2019 expectations for executive conduct as previously communicated by the board of directors and failed to comply with certain Company policies. We incurred $4.8 million of expenses related to the investigation in fiscal 2012. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenses or claims in the future related to the conduct that was the subject of the investigation or similar conduct that has occurred in the past or, given Mr. Friedman\u2019s continued involvement with the Company, may occur in the future.\nCompetition in the home furnishings sector of the retail market may adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe home furnishings sector within the retail market is highly competitive. We compete with the interior design trade and specialty stores, as well as antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at higher price points. We also compete with national and regional home furnishing retailers and department stores. In addition, we compete with mail order Source Books and online retailers focused on home furnishings. We compete with these and other retailers for customers, suitable retail locations, vendors, qualified employees and management personnel. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. In addition, increased Source Book mailings by our competitors may adversely affect response rates to our own Source Book mailings. Moreover, increased competition may result, and has resulted in the past, in potential or actual litigation between us and our competitors relating to such activities as competitive sales, hiring practices and other matters. As a result, increased competition may adversely affect our future financial performance, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully is determined by several factors, including, among other things, the quality of our product selection, our brand, our merchandise presentation and value proposition, customer service, pricing and store locations. We may not ultimately succeed in competing with other retailers in our market.\nDisruptions in the global financial markets may make it difficult for us to borrow a sufficient amount of capital to finance the carrying costs of inventory and to pay for capital expenditures and operating costs, which could negatively affect our business.\nIn the past, disruptions in the global financial markets and banking systems have made credit and capital markets more difficult for companies to access, even for some companies with established revolving or other credit facilities. Under the credit agreement governing the Restoration Hardware, Inc. revolving line of credit, each financial institution that is part of the syndicate for the revolving line of credit is responsible for providing a portion of the loans to be made under the revolving line of credit. Factors that have previously affected our borrowing ability under the revolving line of credit have included the borrowing base formula limitations, adjustments in the appraised value of our inventory used to calculate the borrowing base and the availability of each of our lenders to advance its portion of requested borrowing drawdowns under the facility. If, in connection with a disruption in the global financial markets or otherwise, any participant, or group of participants, with a significant portion of the commitments in the revolving line of credit fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, and if we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or group of participants on a timely basis (if at all), then our liquidity and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nReductions in the volume of mall traffic or closing of shopping malls as a result of unfavorable economic conditions or changing demographic patterns could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with unsold inventory.\nMost of our stores are currently located in shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those malls. These stores benefit from the ability of the malls\u2019 \u201canchor\u201d tenants, generally large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the malls as shopping destinations. Unfavorable economic conditions, particularly in certain regions, have adversely affected mall traffic and resulted in the closing of certain anchor stores and have threatened the viability of certain commercial real estate firms which operate major shopping malls. A continuation of this trend, including failure of a large commercial landlord or continued declines in the popularity of mall shopping generally among our customers, could reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur business depends upon the successful operation of our distribution facilities, furniture home delivery hubs and customer service center, as well as our ability to fulfill orders and to deliver our merchandise to our customers in a timely manner.\nOur business depends upon the successful operation of our distribution centers, furniture home delivery hubs and customer service center, as well as our order management and fulfillment services and the re-stocking of inventories within our stores. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that our facilities have adequate capacity to support our current level of operations, and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from any growth of our business.\nIf we encounter difficulties associated with any of our facilities or if any of our facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, earthquakes (to which our California-based distribution and home delivery facilities in Tracy and Mira Loma, and in the future Patterson, and our corporate headquarters in Corte Madera are particularly vulnerable), power outages or other natural disasters, we could face shortages of inventory resulting in \u201cout of stock\u201d conditions in our stores, significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to both our stores and online customers and the inability to process orders in a timely manner or ship goods to our customers. Further, any significant interruption in the operation of our customer service center could also reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and customers, which could result in lost sales, cancelled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand.\nIn January 2012, we opened a furniture home delivery hub in Avenel, New Jersey and, in February 2012, we opened a furniture distribution center in North East, Maryland. Further, we expanded into an additional 400,000 square feet at our West Jefferson, Ohio distribution center in May 2013, opened a furniture distribution center in Grand Prairie, Texas in September 2013 and in-sourced three home furniture delivery facilities in 2013. During fiscal 2014, we in-sourced two additional home furniture delivery facilities in Atlanta, Georgia and Carmel, New York. As a result of these and other efforts with respect to our distribution facilities, we may encounter operational difficulties with respect to our facilities, such as disruptions in transitioning fulfillment orders to the new distribution facilities and problems associated with operating new facilities or reducing the size and changing functions of existing facilities, and any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in raw materials and energy costs.\nIncreases in the prices of the components and raw materials used in our products could negatively affect the sales of our merchandise and our product margins. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including: commodity prices including prices for oil, lumber and cotton, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, currency exchange rates and government regulation. In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for freight and distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and overall costs to purchase products from our vendors. Accordingly, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our vendors\u2019 cost of business and ultimately our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative costs. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products results in decreased demand for our products, our results of operations would be harmed. Any such cost increase could reduce our earnings to the extent we are unable to adjust the prices of our products.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on foreign imports for our merchandise.\nBased on total volume dollar purchases, in fiscal 2014 we sourced approximately 90% of our merchandise outside the United States, including 84% from Asia, the majority of which originated from China. In addition, some of the merchandise we purchase from vendors in the United States also depends, in whole or in part, on vendors located outside the United States. As a result, our business highly depends on global trade, as well as trade and cost factors that impact the specific countries where our vendors are located, including Asia. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain our existing foreign vendor relationships and to develop new ones. While we rely on our long-term relationships with our foreign vendors, we have no long-term contracts with them and transact business on an order by order basis. Additionally, many of our imported products are subject to existing duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and quotas that may limit the quantity of some types of goods which we may import into the United States. Our dependence on foreign imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution centers located in the United States, charges on or assessment of additional import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and quotas, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the United States in relation to a particular foreign country, work stoppages, including without limitation as a result of events such as longshoremen strikes, transportation and other delays in shipments, including without limitation as a result of heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States, freight cost increases, economic uncertainties, including inflation, foreign government regulations, trade restrictions, including the United States retaliating against protectionist foreign trade practices and political unrest, increased labor costs and other similar factors that might affect the operations of our vendors in specific countries such as China.\nAn interruption or delay in supply from our foreign sources, or the imposition of additional duties, taxes or other charges on these imports, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured.\nIn addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our vendors could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports/exports or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, there remains a risk that one or more of our foreign vendors will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our global compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements by any of our vendors or the failure to adhere to labor, manufacturing safety and other laws by any of our vendors, or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our vendors from those generally accepted in the United States, could disrupt our supply of products from our vendors or the shipment of products to us, result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand and subject us to boycotts by our customers or activist groups, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nStrikes or work stoppages affecting port workers and other industries involved in the transportation of our products could adversely affect our business.\nVarious transportation providers and industries involved in the transportation of our products, such as port workers, experience from time to time work strikes and work stoppages. Strikes between longshoreman and clerical workers at ports in the past few years have completely shut down such ports for a time, impacting retail and other industries. In particular, the union contract for West Coast longshoremen expired in the summer of 2014 and has resulted in a work slow-down at the West Coast ports. The West Coast ports serve as the entry and exit for trade between the U.S. and Asia and we source the vast majority of our merchandise from Asia. As a result, any significant work stoppage, slowdown or other disruption involving ports or other industries involved in the transportation of our products, could reduce our ability to timely deliver products to our stores and our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe extend unsecured credit to our vendors.\nSome of our vendors have limited cash flows and/or access to capital and require us to advance payments in order for them to be able to meet our supply requirements. We typically advance a portion of the payments to be made to such vendors under our purchase orders prior to the delivery of the ordered products. These advance payments are unsecured. These vendors may become insolvent and their failure to repay our advances, and any related failure to deliver products to us, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for the majority of our product shipments.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for our product shipments to our stores and to our customers outside of certain areas. Our utilization of their delivery services for shipments, or those of any other shipping companies we may elect to use, is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and strikes, work stoppages and inclement weather, which may impact the shipping companies\u2019 abilities to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the third-party transportation providers we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information.\nA significant number of customer purchases across all of our channels are made using credit cards. Additionally, a significant number of our customer orders are placed through our websites, and we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our customers. Also, we depend in part throughout our operations on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our\ninformation systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malicious software, phishing attacks and security breaches, including credit card breaches. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including vandalism, catastrophic events, and human error. Our operations may further be impacted by security breaches that occur at third party vendors.\nIn order for our business to function successfully, we and other market participants must be able to handle and transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely. We became fully compliant with Payment Card Industry, or PCI, Data Security Standards during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with PCI or other industry recommended practices in the future. We also expect to incur additional expenses to maintain PCI compliance in the future. Further, there is increased litigation over personally identifiable information and we may be subject to one or more claims or lawsuits related to intentional or unintentional exposure of our customer\u2019s personally identifiable information. Even though we are compliant with such standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data.\nAny breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our website and choose not to purchase from us. If a computer hacker or other third party is able to circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, fines, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to expend significant resources to change our business practices or modify our service offerings in connection with the protection of personally identifiable information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we collect and store personal information from consumers in the course of doing business. States and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft, including laws governing treatment of personally identifiable information. These laws have increased the costs of doing business and, if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies. If we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also incur legal costs if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing, and storage of personal data. Investigations, lawsuits, or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling personal data could result in increased costs and negative market reaction.\nFurthermore, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting additional state and federal proposals addressing data privacy and security. As the data privacy and security laws and regulations evolve, we may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that we process in connection with the purchases of our products.\nWe currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not cover certain of these cybersecurity losses and liability.\nMaterial damage to, or interruptions in, our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe depend largely upon our information technology systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations, many of which we have only adopted and implemented within the past several years in connection with rebuilding our supply chain and infrastructure. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters. Damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Management information system failures or telecommunications system problems may disrupt operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe also rely heavily on our information technology staff. If we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area, we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems.\nWe rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner.\nWe are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues as we upgrade our website software, computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations and e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage the strategy and costs of our catalog and promotional mailings could have a negative impact on our business.\nCatalog mailings are an important component of our business. We continue to adjust and refine our Source Book mailing strategy and we expect to do so in the future. For example, in 2013, we continued expanding the page counts of our catalogs, and in the same year, we also reduced the frequency of Source Books circulated to one mailing per year. We intend to continue adjusting our catalog strategy based on a variety of factors, including the success of the various changes that we adopt. We can provide no assurances as to the success of any Source Book strategy we pursue. Increased expenditures on our catalog strategy may result in the production of too many Source Books, which could negatively affect our operating margins. Reducing expenditures on our catalog strategy, however, could overly restrict catalog circulation and have a negative effect on our revenues. If we fail to adequately adjust our catalog strategy to meet our goals, or if our catalog strategy is unsuccessful, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We rely on customary discounts from the basic shipping rate structure that are available for our catalog mailings, which could be changed or discontinued at any time. The market price for paper has fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Future increases in shipping rates, paper costs or printing costs would have a negative impact on our operating results to the extent that we are unable to offset such increases by raising prices, by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems or by using alternative direct-mail formats.\nWe have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our catalogs. Customer response to our catalogs depends substantially on product assortment, product availability and creative presentation, the selection of customers to whom the catalogs are mailed, changes in mailing strategies, the page size, page count, frequency and timing of delivery of the catalogs, as well as the general retail sales environment and current domestic and global economic conditions. The failure to effectively produce or distribute our catalogs could affect the timing of catalog delivery. The timing of catalog delivery has been and can be affected by shipping service delays. Any delays in the timing of catalog delivery could cause customers to forgo or defer purchases. If the performance of our catalogs declines, if we misjudge the correlation between our catalog circulation and net sales, or if our catalog circulation optimization strategy is not successful, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur failure to successfully anticipate merchandise returns might have a negative impact on our business.\nWe record a reserve for merchandise returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance in each reporting period. If actual returns are greater than those projected and reserved for by management, additional sales returns might be recorded in future periods. In addition, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged, we often do not receive full retail value from the resale or liquidation of the merchandise. Further, the introduction of new merchandise, changes in merchandise mix, changes in consumer confidence or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed merchandise return reserves. Adverse economic conditions in the past have resulted in an increase in our merchandise returns. Any significant increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our reserves could harm our business and operating results.\nWe face product liability risks and certain of our products may be subject to recalls or other actions by regulatory authorities, and any such recalls or similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face product liability, product safety and product compliance risks relating to the design, manufacturing, raw material sourcing, testing, contents, importation, sale, use and performance of some of our products. The products we sell must be designed and manufactured to be safe for their intended purposes. Some of our products must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations. For example, some of our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the \u201cCPSIA\u201d), which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d) to establish product bans, substance bans, substance limits, performance requirements, test methods and other compliance verification processes. The CPSC is empowered to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, up to and including product recalls. We are required to report certain incidents related to the safety and compliance of our products to the CPSC, and failure to do so could result in a civil penalty. The CPSC is particularly active in regulation and enforcement activities related to the kinds of children\u2019s products sold in our Baby & Child division. Certain of the products we sell are subject to the Lacey Act, prohibiting the importation and sale of products containing illegally harvested wood, among other things. Likewise, many of our products are subject to the California Air Resources Board (the \u201cCARB\u201d) regulations of formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products (e.g., plywood, medium density fiberboard, etc.).\nWe maintain a product safety and compliance program to help ensure our products are safe, legal and made consistently in compliance with our values. Nonetheless, our products have, from time to time, been subject to recall for product safety and compliance reasons, and concerns of product safety and compliance could result in future voluntary or involuntary removal of products, product recalls, other actions by applicable government authorities or product liability, personal injury or property damage claims.\nFederal, state, provincial and local legislators and regulators in the United States and Canada, where our products are sold, continue to adopt new product laws and regulations. These new laws and regulations have increased or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of\ncertain of our products as well as the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations. In addition, product recalls, removal of products, product compliance enforcement actions and defending product liability claims can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere are claims made against us and/or our management from time to time that can result in litigation or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.\nFrom time to time we and/or our management are involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices, claims of intellectual property infringement, including with respect to trademarks and trade dress, claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices, claims with respect to our collection and sale of reproduction products, and consumer class action claims relating to our consumer practices including the collection of zip code or other information from customers. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to product liability and personal injury claims for the products that we sell and the stores we operate. Subject to certain exceptions, our purchase orders generally require the vendor to indemnify us against any product liability claims; however, if the vendor does not have insurance or becomes insolvent, we may not be indemnified. In addition, we could face a wide variety of employee claims against us, including general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment, ERISA and disability claims. Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business, including the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time. Litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.\nLabor activities could cause labor relations difficulties for us.\nCurrently none of our employees are represented by a union. However, our employees have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union, and union organizational activities have occurred previously at our Baltimore distribution center. We cannot predict the negative effects that any future organizational activities will have on our business and operations. If we were to become subject to work stoppages, we could experience disruption in our operations and increases in our labor costs, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIntellectual property claims by third parties or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nThird parties have and may in the future assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business to include new products and product categories and move into other geographic markets. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating certain of our products and brand from those of our competitors and creating and\nsustaining demand for certain of our products. We also cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer.\nWe are subject to risks associated with occupying substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs. We may choose in the future to acquire some of our store locations, which will subject us to additional risks.\nWe lease all but one of our retail store locations and we also lease our outlet stores, our corporate headquarters and our thirteen distribution and home delivery facilities. The initial lease term of our retail stores generally ranges from ten to fifteen years, and certain leases contain renewal options for up to fifteen years. Most leases for our retail stores provide for a minimum rent, typically including escalating rent increases, plus a percentage rent based upon sales after certain minimum thresholds are achieved, as well as common area maintenance charges, real property insurance and real estate taxes. We purchased the building and land for our store in San Francisco, but to date we have principally relied upon leases with landlords for our other locations. As we develop new stores in the future, we may explore other models for our real estate which could include joint ventures or other forms of equity ownership in the real estate interests associated with new sites and buildings. These approaches might require additional capital investment and could present different risks than a traditional store lease with a landlord, including greater financial exposure if a new store location is not as successful as we originally target in our plans.\nIf we decide to close an existing or future store, we may nonetheless have continuing obligations with respect to that property pursuant to the applicable lease or ownership arrangements, including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease, to arrange for the sale of an owned property or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, our relationships with current and prospective landlords and other factors that are not within our control. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases or other obligations for stores that we close could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with laws may be costly, and changes in laws could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, e-commerce, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers generally or govern our business. If these regulations were to change or were violated by us or our vendors or buying agents, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make ordinary conduct of our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, as a retail business, changes in laws related to employee benefits and treatment of employees, including laws related to limitations on employee hours, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits or overtime pay, could negatively impact us by increasing compensation and benefits costs for overtime and medical expenses. In addition, relatively new United States health care laws and potential global and domestic greenhouse gas emission requirements and other environmental legislation and regulations could result in increased direct compliance costs for us (or may cause our vendors to raise the prices they charge us in order to maintain profitable operations because of increased compliance costs), increased transportation costs or reduced availability of raw materials.\nBecause of our international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws.\nWe source substantially all of our products abroad, and we are increasing the level of our international sourcing activities in an effort to obtain more of our products directly from vendors located abroad. Additionally, we have expanded our business-to-business sales. The foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, or limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar laws and regulations, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-bribery laws and other anti-corruption laws, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel. Our operations and consumer spending may be affected by natural disasters or other similar events, including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, widespread illness or fires. In particular, our corporate headquarters is located in Northern California, and other parts of our operations including distribution facilities are located in Northern and Southern California, each of which is in a seismically active region susceptible to earthquakes that could disrupt our operations and affect our operating results. Many of our vendors are also located in areas that may be affected by such events. Moreover, geopolitical or public safety conditions which affect consumer behavior and spending may impact our business. Terrorist attacks in the United States or threats of terrorist attacks in the United States in the future, as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them, could again result in reduced levels of consumer spending. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenue and costs.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future.\nWe experienced a net loss of $7.1 million in fiscal 2010. We achieved profitability in fiscal 2011 with net income of $20.6 million. We experienced a GAAP net loss of $12.8 million in fiscal 2012 as a result of certain non-recurring and other items. We may experience net losses in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in future periods.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record income tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. Under United States federal and state income tax laws, if over a rolling three-year period, the cumulative change in our ownership exceeds 50%, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited. Changes in ownership can occur due to transactions in our stock or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or, in certain circumstances, securities convertible into our common stock. Certain transactions we have completed, including our going private transaction in June 2008, and the sale of shares\ncontemplated in our initial public offering may impact the timing of the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards. Furthermore, it is possible that transactions in our stock that may not be within our control may cause us to exceed the 50% cumulative change threshold and may impose a limitation on the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Any such limitation on the timing of utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards would increase the use of cash to settle our tax obligations. We expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation may be enacted in the future that could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with an indefinite life, goodwill and trademarks, and substantial amounts of long lived assets, principally property and equipment. Changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of these assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain store locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with an indefinite life, goodwill and trademarks, and substantial amounts of property and equipment. We make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for these long lived assets. We also review the carrying value of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. If these impairment charges are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected. In that regard, we recorded $1.4 million and $2.1 million impairment charges on long-lived assets of certain underperforming stores in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2010, respectively, and we recorded charges amounting to $3.2 million related to retail store closures in fiscal 2011. No such related charges were recorded in fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2012.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which requires us to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2015. However, if we identify in the future one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, even if our management concludes in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if they are not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated, or reviewed, or if they interpret the relevant requirements differently from us. Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies may be identified during the audit process or at other times.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources and systems and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports. Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic reports on a timely basis, which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, harm our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe incur costs as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. The reporting requirements, rules, and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThese rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, or as executive officers.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make the sourcing of our products more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d), the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals in their products, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. Some of these minerals are commonly used in many products and may be used in some of the products we offer. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether such minerals, if used in the products of the company, originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in our products and necessary for their functionality.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs to comply with the rules, including costs related to the determination of the origin of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to not purchase our products, which could impact our sales and harm our reputation. In addition, since we source substantially all of our products abroad, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation and affect our compliance with the SEC regulations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile. As a retailer, our results are significantly affected by factors outside our control, particularly consumer spending and consumer confidence, which can significantly affect our stock price. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in preferences of our customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsize of the public float;\n\u2022\nstock price performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\ndefault on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nactions by competitors or other shopping center tenants;\n\u2022\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated negative earnings or other announcements by us or other retail companies;\n\u2022\ndowngrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other similar events;\n\u2022\nissuances or expected issuances of capital stock; and\n\u2022\nglobal economic, legal and regulatory changes unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with a capital raise or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution.\nIn addition, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. All of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable, except for (i) 24,772 shares as of January 31, 2015 issued under our 2012 Equity Replacement Plan that are subject to additional time-based resale restrictions, (ii) 11,112 shares as of January 31, 2015 issued under either our 2012 Stock Option Plan or our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan that are subject to additional time-based resale restrictions and (iii) certain other shares of our common stock that are held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), which are restricted securities under the Securities Act.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, subject to certain exceptions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nWe are required to comply with the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) listing requirements, including its independence requirements. Failure by us to comply with the NYSE listing requirements could result in us receiving a deficiency or delisting notice from the NYSE.\nWe are required to comply with the NYSE listing requirements, including its requirement that the board of directors of a listed company be comprised of a majority of independent directors. While we are currently in compliance with this requirement, we may in the future temporarily fail to comply with it due to factors that are outside of our control. Failure by us to comply with the NYSE listing requirements could result in us receiving a deficiency or delisting notice from the NYSE.\nOn November 12, 2014, we notified the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that, due to the resignation of an independent director from our board of directors effective November 7, 2014, we had only four independent directors serving on our then eight-member board of directors. Accordingly, effective November 7, 2014, our board of directors did not satisfy Section 303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which\nrequires that the board of directors of a listed company be comprised of a majority of independent directors. Our board of directors subsequently appointed a new independent director effective January 22, 2015 and we have regained compliance with Section 303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\nRisks Relating to Our Convertible Notes Financing\nWe expect that our common stock may experience increased trading volatility in connection with our Convertible Notes Financing.\nIn June 2014, we issued 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties (the \u201cBond Hedge\u201d) and warrant transactions (the \u201cWarrants\u201d and together with the Notes and the Bond Hedge, the \u201cConvertible Notes Financing\u201d) with the same counterparties (the \u201chedge counterparties\u201d).\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedge positions with respect to the Bond Hedge and Warrants, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates would likely purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company\u2019s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, including with certain investors in the Notes. These hedging activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or the Notes.\nIn addition, we expect that many investors in, including future purchasers of, the Notes may employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock.\nFurther, investors in the Notes may periodically modify their arbitrage strategies with respect to the Notes or modify their hedge positions with respect to the Notes from time to time. The hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates also may periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time (and are likely to do so during the conversion period relating to any conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental repurchase date or otherwise). Such modifications may be implemented by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions and/or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the Notes (which could affect a noteholder\u2019s ability to convert the Notes or the amount and value of the consideration received upon conversion of the Notes) will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIt is not possible to predict the effect that these hedging or arbitrage strategies adopted by holders of the Notes or counterparties to the Bond Hedge and Warrants will have on the market price of our common stock. For example, the SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock). Such rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC Regulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. of a \u201cLimit Up-Limit Down\u201d program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any changes in government regulations or other factors that affect the manner in which third parties can engage in hedging strategies, including entering into short sales or swaps on our common stock, could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the Notes and/or our common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control.\nIn addition, prior to the Convertible Notes Financing, our common stock experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. We cannot predict whether the market price of our common stock will rise or fall. The market price of our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows, deferred revenue, other financial and non-financial metrics and other factors described in greater detail elsewhere in this section, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to the Bond Hedge and Warrants.\nTaken together, the Bond Hedge and Warrants are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution that could occur upon delivery of shares of common stock to satisfy to the Company\u2019s conversion obligation under the Notes, with the intent that the Company\u2019s stockholders would not experience dilution until the Notes reach a conversion price of approximately $171.98 per share, the strike price of the warrant transactions, which represents a 100% premium over the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock at the time the Company entered into the Convertible Notes Financing. However, these transactions are complex, and there can be no assurance that they will operate as planned.\nFor example, the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the Bond Hedge. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our Bond Hedges becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties.\nThe terms of the Bond Hedge and Warrants may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation in the event of certain corporate and other transactions. The Bond Hedge and Warrants may not operate as the Company had originally intended in the event that the Company is required to adjust the terms of such instruments as a result of transactions in the future or in the event of other unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the Bond Hedge or Warrants.\nIn the event that the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Company\u2019s earnings per share.\nThe claims of holders of the Notes are structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries; our ability to repay our debt, including the Notes, depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us.\nThe Notes are our obligations exclusively. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and substantially all of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries has guaranteed or otherwise become obligated with respect to the Notes. Our right to receive assets from one of our subsidiaries upon its liquidation or reorganization, and the right of holders of the Notes to participate in those assets, is\nstructurally subordinated to any and all debt and other obligations that such subsidiary may incur (including trade payables). In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or of a similar proceeding with respect to any of our subsidiaries, we, as a common equity owner of such subsidiary, and, therefore, the holders of the Notes, rank behind such subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including such subsidiary\u2019s trade creditors. Even if we were a creditor of one of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, may be substantially dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds (whether by dividend, distribution or loan) from our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the Notes. We can provide no assurances that the agreements governing the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes when due. In particular, the current credit agreement of our primary operating subsidiary, Restoration Hardware, Inc., restricts the ability of such subsidiary to make restricted payments to the holding company that would enable us to make payments with respect to the Notes unless certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or availability requirements are met and a default under the credit agreement would not otherwise occur as a result of the payment. This minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement entails a minimum 1.1:1 ratio of (a) earnings, minus capital expenditures, minus taxes, to (b) debt service payments, plus all dividends/distributions made to Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. or any other non-borrower/guarantor of the credit agreement, plus debt prepayments. Although Restoration Hardware, Inc. currently meets these requirements under the credit agreement for purposes of making restricted payments to us to fund our payments with respect to the Notes, there can be no assurance that it will continue to meet these requirements in the future. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1-Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as ASC 470-20-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include the amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect our future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nThe settlement feature of the Notes may have adverse consequences.\nThe settlement feature of the Notes may:\n\u2022\nresult in holders receiving no shares upon conversion or fewer shares relative to the conversion value of the Notes;\n\u2022\nreduce our liquidity;\n\u2022\ndelay holders\u2019 receipt of the consideration due upon conversion; and\n\u2022\nsubject holders to the market risks of our shares before receiving any shares upon conversion.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, investors in the Notes will, at our election, receive shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, based upon the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for each of the 45 trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period. This period means, for Notes with a conversion date occurring on or after the 50th scheduled trading day before the maturity date, the 45 consecutive trading-day period beginning on, and including, the 47th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date (or, if such scheduled trading day is not a trading day, the immediately following trading day), and in all other instances, the 45 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the third trading day immediately following the related conversion date. Accordingly, if the price of our common stock decreases during this period, the amount and/or value of consideration investors in the Notes receive will be adversely affected. Upon conversion of the Notes, we expect to settle the Notes with a combination of cash and shares of common stock with a minimum cash payment of $1,000 per Note. Furthermore, because we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, the conversion of Notes may significantly reduce our liquidity.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the Notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the Notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the Notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Notes could depress the market price of our common stock.\nHolders may not be able to convert their Notes prior to March 15, 2019, and the trading price of the Notes could be less than the value of the amount of cash and the number of shares of our common stock, if any, into which such Notes could otherwise be converted.\nPrior to March 15, 2019, a holder may convert a note only if one or more specified conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, holders will not be able to convert their Notes until March 15, 2019 and may not be able to receive the amount of cash and the value of the number of shares of our common stock, if any, into which the Notes would otherwise be convertible at such time. In addition, for these and other reasons, the trading price of the Notes could be substantially less than the value of the amount of cash and the number of shares of our common stock, if any, into which the Notes would otherwise be convertible.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the Notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its Notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a holder converts its Notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their Notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their Notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the Notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to\npurchase the Notes, to pay special interest, if any, due on the Notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the Notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the Notes and the terms of the Bond Hedge and Warrants may delay or hinder an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights allow holders of Notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions of the indenture governing the Notes requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, including certain corporate transactions such as a change in control, may result in a change in the value of the Notes. Additionally, upon certain change of control transactions, the offsetting Bond Hedge and Warrants that we entered into at the time we issued the Notes may be exercised and/or terminated early. As a result of these provisions, we may be required to make payments to, or renegotiate terms with, holders of the Notes and/or the hedge counterparties.\nThese features of the Notes and the Bond Hedge and Warrants, including the financial implications of any renegotiation of the above-mentioned provisions, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders, and may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our stockholders than it would otherwise be, or could require us to pay a portion of the consideration available in such a transaction to holders of the Notes or Warrants or the counterparties to the Bond Hedge.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of the proceeds to us from the Convertible Notes Financing and might not apply the proceeds of the Convertible Notes Financing in ways that yield significant returns.\nOur management has broad discretion to use the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes Financing. Management used a portion of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes Financing for the cost of the Bond Hedge, after such cost was offset by the proceeds of Warrants, and to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under the Restoration Hardware, Inc. revolving line of credit and term loan. The remaining proceeds are available to management to use for general corporate purposes, including to fund our real estate business initiative related to the development of our next generation Galleries. However, management has not allocated the remaining net proceeds for any specific purposes. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of the remaining net proceeds.", "PERMNO": 86187, "SIC": 5712, "TIC": "RH"}
