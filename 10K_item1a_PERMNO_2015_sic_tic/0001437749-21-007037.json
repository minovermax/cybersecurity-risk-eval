{"cik": "1083522", "company": "JONES SODA CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in us.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities\nWe have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to our ongoing operations and generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a net loss of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our accumulated deficit increased to $70.0 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year\u2019s deficit of $67.0 million.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had an adverse effect on our financial condition. If our products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance and our revenues do not increase significantly, we may continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we are not able to successfully execute on our future operating plans, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nIt is critical that we meet our sales goals and increase sales going forward as our operating plan already reflects prior significant cost containment measures and may make it difficult to achieve top-line growth if further significant reductions become necessary. If we do not meet our sales goals, our available cash and working capital will decrease and our financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nIf we do not effectively utilize the proceeds from our recent financing from Heavenly Rx, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOn July 11, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Heavenly Rx Ltd. (Heavenly Rx) pursuant to which we sold certain securities to Heavenly Rx for an aggregate purchase price of $9,000,000 in cash. We intend to continue to use the proceeds for general working capital and other purposes, including sales and marketing, product development and capital expenditures for its legacy business and new business initiatives. However, if we are unable to effectively utilize the proceeds of this financing, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, which may not be available when needed or may be costly and dilutive.\nWe may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative that we meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our operating plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business, our markets and the broader economy. In addition, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertain market conditions may limit our ability to access capital, may reduce demand for certain products, and may negatively impact our supply chain. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Moreover, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary, we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders, which may include, without limitation, public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, a rights offering, and other strategic alternatives; however, these options may not ultimately be available or feasible when needed.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities will have little or no value.\nAlthough our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, as disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically, as noted above, we have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to our ongoing operations and generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. These prior losses and possible future losses have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing in the near future and thereafter. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through sales of our products, financings or from other sources or transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our shareholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Brand and Our Industry\nWe compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our target market, trendy, young consumers looking for a distinctive tonality in their beverage choices. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors and retailers of our brands as beverage brands that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth. If we are not successful in the revitalization and growth of our brand and product offerings, we may not achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. In addition, we may not be able to effectively execute our marketing strategies in light of the various closures and event cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any failure of our Jones Soda brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\nOur brand and image are keys to our business and any inability to maintain a positive brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot predict whether our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 branding and on consumer preferences. In addition, negative public relations and product quality issues, whether real or imagined, could tarnish our reputation and image of the affected brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Our brand image can also be adversely affected by unfavorable reports, studies and articles, litigation, or regulatory or other governmental action, whether involving our products or those of our competitors.\nCompetition from traditional and large, well-financed non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers may adversely affect our distribution relationships and may hinder development of our existing markets, as well as prevent us from expanding our markets.\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail outlets and for marketing focus by our distributors, all of whom also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with all non-alcoholic beverages, most of which are marketed by companies with substantially greater financial resources than ours. Some of these competitors are placing severe pressure on independent distributors not to carry competitive sparkling brands such as ours. We also compete with regional beverage producers and \u201cprivate label\u201d soft drink suppliers.\nOur direct competitors in the sparkling beverage category include traditional large beverage companies and distributors, and regional premium soft drink companies. These national and international competitors have advantages such as lower production costs, larger marketing budgets, greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than ours. We may not be able to grow our volumes or maintains our selling prices, whether in existing markets or as we enter new markets.\nIncreased competitor consolidations, market-place competition, particularly among branded beverage products, and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our distribution channels, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network, we intend to introduce product extensions and additional brands. Lemoncocco, our new premium non-carbonated beverage, is an example of a new product we have introduced recently. We may not be successful in doing this, or it may take us longer than anticipated to achieve market acceptance of these new products and brands, if at all. Other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition, particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets, as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception, so our ability to continue developing new products to satisfy the changing preferences of consumers will determine our long-term success.\nFailure to introduce new brands, products or product extensions into the marketplace as current ones mature and to meet the changing preferences of consumers could prevent us from gaining market share and achieving long-term profitability. Product lifecycles can vary and consumer preferences and loyalties change over time. Although we try to anticipate these shifts and innovate new products to introduce to our consumers, we may not succeed. Consumer preferences also are affected by factors other than taste, such as health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns, shifting consumer needs, changes in consumer lifestyles, increased consumer information and competitive product and pricing pressures. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the negative publicity associated with these issues. In addition, there may be a decreased demand for certain products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we do not adequately anticipate or adjust to respond to these and other changes in consumer preferences, we may not be able to maintain and grow our brand image and our sales may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience a reduced demand for some of our products due to health concerns (including obesity) and legislative initiatives against sweetened beverages.\nConsumers are concerned about health and wellness; public health officials and government officials are increasingly vocal about obesity and its consequences. There has been a trend among some public health advocates and dietary guidelines to recommend a reduction in sweetened beverages, as well as increased public scrutiny, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (as described below), and additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling/packing of the beverage industry. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, tax or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, increasing public concern with respect to sweetened beverages could reduce demand for our beverages and increase desire for more low-calorie soft drinks, water, enhanced water, coffee-flavored beverages, tea, and beverages with natural sweeteners. We are continuously working to reduce calories and sugar in our Jones Cane Sugar products while launching new products like Lemoncocco, to pair with existing brand extensions such as Jones Sugar Free that round out our diversified portfolio.\nLegislative or regulatory changes that affect our products, including new taxes, could reduce demand for products or increase our costs.\nTaxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal, state and local governments in the United States, or other countries in which we operate could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our beverages. Several municipalities in the United States have implemented or are considering implementing taxes on the sale of certain \u201csugared\u201d beverages, including non-diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters to help fund various initiatives. These taxes could materially affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to develop and commercialize CBD-infused beverages and comply with laws and regulations governing cannabis, hemp or related products.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately forty states authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the Farm Bill. Continued development of the industrial hemp and cannabis industries will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp and cannabis at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp and cannabis industries is currently encouraging, growth is not assured. While there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of industrial hemp and cannabis, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. In addition, the manufacture, labeling and distribution of our products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell products in the future. The FDA regulates our products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded. In particular, we would be subject to regulation by the federal government and other state and local agencies as a result of the development and commercialization of cannabidiol (CBD) products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to our business, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability to operate our business and its financial results.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\nOur reliance on distributors, retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable distributors, retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors, retailers and brokers sell and distribute competing products, including non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the distributors, retailers and brokers of this network. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other beverage companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors, retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such third-parties\u2019 financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sales activities.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract additional distributors, retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf\nthe level of demand for our brands and products in a particular distribution area;\n\u25cf\nour ability to price our products at levels competitive with those of competing products; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors, retailers and brokers.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Our inability to achieve success with regards to any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships in that particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market, which will likely adversely affect our revenues and financial results.\nWe incur significant time and expense in attracting and maintaining key distributors.\nOur marketing and sales strategy depends in large part on the availability and performance of our independent distributors. We currently do not have, nor do we anticipate in the future that we will be able to establish, long-term contractual commitments from some of our distributors. We may not be able to maintain our current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with distributors in new geographic distribution areas. Moreover, there is the additional possibility that we may have to incur additional expenditures to attract and maintain key distributors in one or more of our geographic distribution areas in order to profitably exploit our geographic markets.\nIf we lose any of our key distributors or national retail accounts, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, A. Lassonde Inc. (\u201cLassonde\u201d), one of our independent distributors and our top account by revenue represented approximately 24% of revenue. We continually seek to expand and upgrade our distributor network, DTR accounts and national retail relationships. However, we may not be able to maintain our key distributor base. The loss of any of our key distributors (such as Lassonde) or national accounts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, liquidity and financial results, could negatively impact our ability to retain our relationships with our other distributors and our ability to expand our market, and would place increased dependence on our other independent distributors and national accounts.\nIt is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors are not required to place minimum orders with us.\nOur independent distributors and national accounts are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. In order to reduce their inventory costs, independent distributors typically order products from us on a \u201cjust in time\u201d basis in quantities and at such times based on the demand for the products in a particular distribution area. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally, our larger distributors and national partners, may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels, supply of raw materials or other key supplies could negatively affect us.\nIf we do not adequately manage our inventory levels, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly for new products, seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products, we may end up with too much inventory, resulting in higher storage costs, increased trade spend and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand, we could damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would also unfavorably impact our sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, our business could be harmed.\nWe do not manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). We do not own the plants or the majority of the equipment required to manufacture and package our beverage products, and we do not anticipate bringing the manufacturing process in-house in the future. Our ability to maintain effective relationships with contract manufacturers and other third parties for the production and delivery of our beverage products in a particular geographic distribution area is important to the success of our operations within each distribution area. Competition for contract manufacturers\u2019 business is intense, especially in the western United States, and this could make it more difficult for us to obtain new or replacement manufacturers, or to locate back-up manufacturers, in our various distribution areas, and could also affect the economic terms of our agreements with our existing manufacturers. We may not be able to maintain our relationships with current contract manufacturers or establish satisfactory relationships with new or replacement contract manufacturers, whether in existing or new geographic distribution areas. The failure to establish and maintain effective relationships with contract manufacturers for a distribution area could increase our manufacturing costs and thereby materially reduce gross profits from the sale of our products in that area. Poor relations with any of our contract manufacturers could adversely affect the amount and timing of product delivered to our distributors for resale, which would in turn adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In addition, our agreements with our contract manufacturers are terminable at any time, and any such termination could disrupt our ability to deliver products to our customers.\nOur dependence on independent contract manufacturers could make management of our manufacturing and distribution efforts inefficient or unprofitable.\nWe are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements, which is customary in the contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the particular geographic area where our contract manufacturers are located, we continually evaluate which of our contract manufacturers to use. To the extent demand for our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing arrangements, or orders are not submitted on a timely basis, we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely, we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the actual demand for it, resulting in higher storage costs and the potential risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts, which, in turn, would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective relationships with those distributors and key accounts.\nIncreases in costs or shortages of raw materials could harm our business and financial results.\nThe principal raw materials we use include glass bottles, aluminum cans, labels and cardboard cartons, aluminum closures, flavorings, sucrose/inverted pure cane sugar and sucralose. In addition, certain of our contract manufacturing arrangements allow such contract manufacturers to increase their charges to us based on their own cost increases. These manufacturing and ingredient costs are subject to fluctuation. Substantial increases in the prices of our ingredients, raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent that they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. If our supply of these raw materials is impaired or if prices increase significantly, it could affect the affordability of our products and reduce sales.\nThe beverage industry has experienced increased prices for glass bottles over the last several years and the availability of glass supply diminished for companies not under contract. Our fixed-price purchase commitment for glass, which helps mitigate the risk of unexpected price increases, expires at the end of 2022. The prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients may continue to rise in the future. Due to the price sensitivity of our products, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including glass, sugar, and other key supplies, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, in the past there have been industry-wide shortages of certain concentrates, supplements and sweeteners and these shortages could occur again from time to time in the future, which could interfere with and delay production of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, suppliers could fail to provide ingredients or raw materials on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause a serious disruption to our business, increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in costs of energy and increased regulations may have an adverse impact on our gross margin.\nOver the past few years, volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in high fuel prices, which many shipping companies have passed on to their customers by way of higher base pricing and increased fuel surcharges. If fuel prices increase, we expect to experience higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges, as well as energy surcharges on our raw materials. It is hard to predict what will happen in the fuel markets in 2021 and beyond. Due to the price sensitivity of our products, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nDisruption within our supply chain, contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, through our suppliers, business partners, contract manufacturers, independent distributors and retailers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics such as influenza and the COVID-19 pandemic, labor strikes or other reasons, could impair the manufacture, distribution and sale of our products. Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business.\nWe currently purchase our flavor concentrate from various flavor concentrate suppliers, and continually develop other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. Although we have the exclusive rights to flavor concentrates developed with our current flavor concentrate suppliers, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulas for our flavors and concentrates. Consequently, we may be unable to obtain these same flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. If we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our efficiency and operations would be adversely affected; in addition, management turnover causes uncertainties and could harm our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in such areas as finance, sales, marketing and product development. We compete to hire new employees, and, in some cases, must train them and develop their skills and competencies. We may not be able to provide our employees with competitive salaries, and our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\nRecently, we have experienced significant changes in our key personnel, especially on our executive team, and more could occur in the future. Changes to operations, policies and procedures, which can often occur with the appointment of new personnel, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, management transition periods are often difficult as the new employees gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.\nFurther, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, our operations, financial condition and employee morale could be negatively impacted. In addition, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness such as COVID-19.\nIf we lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Operator, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be harmed.\nOur business plan relies significantly on the continued services of Mark Murray, who we hired as our Chief Executive Officer in December 2020, and on the continued services of Eric Chastain, our Chief Operating Officer, who was appointed as our Chief Operating Officer effective June 2014 and has been with the Company for nearly 20 years. If we were to lose the services of Mr. Murray or Mr. Chastain, our ability to execute our business plan could be materially impaired. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that suggest they might leave us.\nIf we fail to protect our trademarks and trade secrets, we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and trade secrecy laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success, and we actively pursue the registration of our trademarks in the United States, Canada and internationally. However, the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks, trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands, profitably exploit our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.\nAs part of the licensing strategy of our brands, we enter into licensing agreements under which we grant our licensing partners certain rights to use our trademarks and other designs. Although our agreements require that the use of our trademarks and designs is subject to our control and approval, any breach of these provisions, or any other action by any of our licensing partners that is harmful to our brands, goodwill and overall image, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we encounter product recalls or other product quality issues, our business may suffer.\nProduct quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish our image and could cause consumers to choose other products. In addition, because of changing government regulations or implementation thereof, or allegations of product contamination, we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific markets. Product recalls could affect our profitability and could negatively affect brand image.\nWe could be exposed to product liability claims.\nAlthough we have product liability and basic recall insurance, insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all product liability claims that may arise. To the extent our product liability coverage is insufficient, a product liability claim would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition. In addition, any product liability claim brought against us may materially damage the reputation and brand image of our products and business.\nOur business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.\nThe production, marketing and sale of our beverages, including contents, labels, caps and containers, are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial, state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production batch or \u201crun\u201d is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we cannot anticipate whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.\nVarious jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of our products. These types of requirements, if they become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, may inhibit sales of such products. In California, a law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. If a component found in one of our products is added to the list, or if the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become available under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in one of our beverages produced for sale in California, the resulting warning requirements or adverse publicity could affect our sales.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks, uncertainties and costs, including distraction of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in sales of products in international markets.\nOur operations outside of the United States, contribute to our revenue and profitability, and we believe that developing and emerging markets could present future growth opportunities for us. However, there can be no assurance that existing or new products that we manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular foreign market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. There are many factors that could adversely affect demand for our products in foreign markets, including our inability to attract and maintain key distributors in these markets; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets; changes in economic, political or social conditions, the status and renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement, imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other legal restrictions; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; inflationary currency, devaluation or fluctuation; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations. If we are unable to effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in international markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business.\nThere is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures may cause an adverse change in weather patterns around the globe resulting in an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could have a negative impact on agricultural productivity, which may limit availability or increase the cost of certain key ingredients such as sugar cane, natural flavors and supplements used in our products. Also, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities, the operation of our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, the increasing concern over climate change may result in more regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements and could result in increased production, transportation and raw material costs. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure or as a result of a cybersecurity attack.\nThe proper functioning of our own information technology (IT) infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. We may not have the necessary financial resources to update and maintain our IT infrastructure, and any failure or interruption of our IT system could adversely impact our operations. In addition, our IT is vulnerable to cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of any such IT failures or disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, transactional errors, processing inefficiencies, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter for many reasons, including seasonality.\nOur sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year.\nIn addition, our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of other factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nOur ability to maintain, develop and expand distribution channels for current and new products, develop favorable arrangements with third party distributors of our products and minimize or reduce issues associated with engaging new distributors and retailers, including, but not limited to, transition costs and expenses and down time resulting from the initial deployment of our products in each new distributor\u2019s network;\n\u25cf\nUnilateral decisions by distributors, grocery store chains, specialty chain stores, club stores, mass merchandisers and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to maintain, develop and expand our direct-to-retail sales channels and national retail accounts, as well as our \u201cmyJones\u201d business;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to manage our resources to sufficiently support general operating activities, promotion allowances and slotting fees, promotion and selling activities, and capital expansion, and our ability to sustain profitability;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to meet the competitive response by much larger, well-funded and established companies currently operating in the beverage industry, as we introduce new competitive products, such as Lemoncocco and our fountain products; and\n\u25cf\nCompetitive products and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors.\nDue to these and other factors, our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to do so in the future, which could cause our operating results in a particular quarter to fail to meet market expectations.\nOur business and periodic financial results can be affected by currency rate fluctuations, because a significant percentage of our business is in Canada.\nA significant percentage of our sales are conducted through our Canadian subsidiary, for which we receive revenues in the Canadian dollar. In addition, a significant percentage of our costs of goods are denominated in the Canadian dollar, due to our co-packing facility in Canada. Because of this we are affected by changes in U.S. exchange rates with the Canadian dollar.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar. The translation of our Canadian revenues, cash and other assets is adversely affected when the United States dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar and is positively affected when the U.S. dollar weakens. Similarly, translation of our Canadian expenses and liabilities is positively affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar and adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens. This exposure to foreign currency risk could significantly affect our revenues and profitability from our Canadian operations and could result in significant fluctuations to our periodic income statements and consolidated balance sheets.\nThroughout 2020, the U.S. dollar\u2019s strength fluctuated significantly in comparison to the Canadian dollar. As of March 11, 2021, the Canadian dollar exchange rate for one U.S. dollar was equal to $0.80 (compared to $0.78 as of December 31, 2020 and $0.77 as of December 31, 2019). We cannot predict future changes in these exchange rates. We do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:\n\u25cf\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u25cf\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u25cf\nchanges in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in share-based compensation; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nIn December 2017, the President signed into law legislation that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, on March 27, 2020 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The December 2017 law, as modified by the CARES Act, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% beginning in 2018, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for tax years beginning in 2021, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax laws remain uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax laws. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge shareholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nGlobal economic, political, social and other conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe beverage industry, and particularly those companies selling premium beverages like us, can be affected by macro-economic factors, including changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions, unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns, which together may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending. Adverse economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital needs, which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they have done in the past. If we experience similar adverse economic conditions in the future, sales of our products could be adversely affected, collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised and we may face obsolescence issues with our inventory, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, while the extent of the impact on our business and financial condition is unknown at this time, we may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to address and limit the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, event cancellations, and limitations affecting the supply of labor and the movement of raw materials and finished products. If available manufacturing capacity is reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively affect the timely supply, pricing and availability of finished products. Moreover, we will also be negatively impacted by current and future closures of restaurants, independent accounts, convenience chains, and retail store chains resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The current closures of restaurants and independent accounts will negatively affect our revenues and cash flows with respect to our fountain business, which comprised approximately 5% and 9% of our revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although retail locations and restaurants have begun to reopen following the closures imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such establishments are required to comply with certain COVID-19 protocols and their future prospects remain unknown at this time; any decrease in business at these types of locations would adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.\nThe United States generally accepted accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide variety of matters that are relevant to our business, such as, but not limited to, stock-based compensation, trade spend and promotions, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes to these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our stock price and investor confidence could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective. Because of their inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, however well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the controls will prevent or detect misstatements. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. The failure of controls by design deficiencies or absence of adequate controls could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, which could also negatively impact our stock price and investor confidence.\nThe terms of the note purchase agreement entered into by us in 2018 may limit our ability to approve certain actions.\nDuring the first half of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2,920,000 of convertible subordinated promissory notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement. In accordance with such note purchase agreement, we agreed not to take certain actions without the approval of holders of not less than a majority-in-interest of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the \u201cRequired Holders\u201d) while such Convertible Notes remain outstanding. Such actions include (a) liquidating, dissolving or winding up the affairs of the company; (b) purchasing or redeeming or paying any cash dividend on any of our capital stock; (c) effecting a material acquisition by us, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and each of the MHP Directors (as defined in the note purchase agreement); (d) increasing the size of the Board of Directors; (e) increasing our equity incentive plan by more than 10% of the amount reserved for the prior fiscal year without the approval of the Board of Directors and each of the MHP Directors (as defined in the note purchase agreement); (f) entering into any transaction with any affiliate, officer, director, employee or holder of more than five percent (5%) of our capital stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis; or (g) terminating, or allowing to be terminated or suspended, the listing of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes on the trading market. If requested by us, the Required Holders may elect not to allow us to take these actions. In the event that we are unable to take these actions, the interests of the company and our shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe terms of the investor rights agreement entered into by us in 2019 may limit our ability to approve certain actions.\nOn July 11, 2019 in connection with our financing with Heavenly Rx, we entered into an investor rights agreement in which we agreed not to take the actions without the approval of the members of our board of directors designated by Heavenly Rx (the \u201cInvestor Designees\u201d) for so long as any Investor Designee serves on our board of directors. Such actions include (a) amending, altering, repealing or waiving any provision of or articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar governance documents of our subsidiaries; (b) offering or selling any securities (with certain exceptions); (c) creating, or authorizing the creation of, or issuing, authorizing the issuance of or changing the terms of any debt security, creating any lien or security interest or incurring debt, or permitting any subsidiary to do the same (with certain exceptions); (d) effecting, authorizing or consenting to any change of control transaction; (e) changing our strategy or principal lines of business or any of our subsidiaries; (f) liquidating or dissolving or acquiescing in the filing of a petition in bankruptcy or similar proceeding; (g) committing to or making any expenditures in excess of $1,000,000 in one or a series of transactions; or (h) committing to do any of the foregoing. If requested by us, the Investor Designees may elect not to allow us to take these actions. In the event that we are unable to take these actions, our interests and those of our shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and a shareholder\u2019s investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the volume and market price of our common stock, and this volatility may continue in the future. In addition, factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results, litigation involving us, general trends relating to the beverage industry, actions by governmental agencies, national economic and stock market considerations as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock and the relative volatility of such market price.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. If we are unable to raise the funds required for all of our planned operations and key initiatives, we may be forced to allocate funds from other planned uses, which may negatively impact our business and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations.\nThe conversion of our convertible subordinated promissory notes could be dilutive to our shareholders.\nAs noted above, during the first half of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2,920,000 of our Convertible Notes to certain institutional and individual accredited investors, including our chief executive officer. The Convertible Notes have a four-year term from the date of issuance and bear interest at 6% per annum until maturity. The holders can convert the Convertible Notes at any time during the term into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of the unpaid principal and interest on the Convertible Note by (ii) $0.32 (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.4 million and related accrued interest were converted into 4,868,079 shares of common stock in accordance with the original terms of the Convertible Notes. The Conversion Price is subject to broad based, weighted average antidilution protection in the event that we issue shares of capital stock or equity equivalents at a price that is less than $0.32 per shares prior to the conversion of the Convertible Notes. Conversion of the Convertible Notes to common stock at any time between their issuance and maturity could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $650,000 and related accrued interest were converted into 2,385,058 shares of common stock in accordance with the original terms of the Convertible Notes.\nAny future equity or debt issuances by us may have dilutive or adverse effects on our existing shareholders.\nFrom time to time, we may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. The issuance of these securities could dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to those of our current shareholders. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQB Marketplace, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur stock is traded on the OTCQB Marketplace. The OTCQB is a significantly more limited market than the national securities exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq system, and there are lower financial or qualitative standards that a company must meet to be listed on the OTCQB. The OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and trading in our common stock may be subject to abuses, volatility and shorting, which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing an investment is suitable for that customer when recommending an investment to a customer. FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for some customers and may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may result in a limited ability to buy and sell our stock. We currently do not meet applicable listing standards of a market senior to the OTC and we may never apply or qualify for future listing on Nasdaq or a senior market.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, so our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell their shares.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell such shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, difficult and prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Washington law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a prohibition on shareholder actions by less than unanimous written consent, limitations on the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders and advance notice procedures with respect to the nomination of candidates for election as directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe have waived the anti-takeover protections provided under Washington law with respect to Heavenly Rx, which could make it easier for Heavenly Rx to acquire us.\nAs described above, certain provisions of Washington law restrict the ability of shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In connection with our strategic financing with Heavenly Rx, effective as of July 11, 2019, our board of directors approved, solely for purposes of RCW 23B.19.040(1)(a)(ii), any future purchase of shares of our common stock by Heavenly Rx which results in Heavenly Rx becoming an \u201cacquiring person\u201d as defined in RCW 23B.19.020(1) (defined as beneficially owning in the aggregate total outstanding shares of common stock comprising 10% or more of the voting power of the company). As a result, Heavenly Rx has the ability to acquire shares of our common stock in the future without being subject to the anti-takeover restrictions provided by Washington law. Subject to the standstill agreement entered into by Heavenly Rx in connection with our strategic financing, which imposes certain restrictions on the ability of Heavenly Rx to acquire any of our securities until July 11, 2021, this prior board approval could enable Heavenly Rx to purchase additional shares of our common stock without being required to seek approval from our board of directors, which could limit the board\u2019s ability to negotiate the business terms with Heavenly Rx and adversely impact our ability to receive higher bids from other acquirers and obtain the best price for the shareholders.", "PERMNO": 90972, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "JSDA"}
