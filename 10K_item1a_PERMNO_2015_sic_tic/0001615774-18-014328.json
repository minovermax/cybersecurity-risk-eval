{"cik": "1314052", "company": "ANAVEX LIFE SCIENCES CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Company\nWe have had a history of losses and no revenue, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception on January 23, 2004 through September 30, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $108,931,967. We can offer no assurance that we will ever operate profitably or that we will generate positive cash flow in the future. To date, we have not generated any revenues from our operations. Our history of losses and no revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our management expects the business to continue to experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, our business might become profitable. We will need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an early stage pharmaceutical research and development company and may never be able to successfully develop marketable products or generate any revenue. We have a very limited relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profits. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe are an early stage company and have not generated any revenues to date and have no operating history. All of our potential drug compounds are in the concept stage or early clinical development stage. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our research and development efforts will be successful or, if successful, that our potential drug compounds will ever be approved for sales to pharmaceutical companies or generate commercial revenues. We have no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise, including, but not limited to, risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of potential drug compounds either in non-clinical testing or in clinical trials, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies. If we fail to become profitable, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe will need additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development activities.\nWe will need to raise additional funding and the current economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional needed capital on terms that are favorable to our Company or at all. We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until we can generate significant revenues, if ever, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through equity or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research and development activities.\nRisks Related to our Business\nEven if we are able to develop our potential drug compounds, we may not be able to receive regulatory approval, or if approved, we may not be able to generate significant revenues or successfully commercialize our products, which will adversely affect our financial results and financial condition and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans which may force us to cease operations.\nAll of our potential drug compounds will require extensive additional research and development, including non-clinical testing and clinical trials, as well as regulatory approvals, before we can market them. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous non-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. We cannot predict if or when any of the potential drug compounds we intend to develop will be approved for marketing. There are many reasons that we may fail in our efforts to develop our potential drug compounds. These include:\n\u25cf the possibility that non-clinical testing or clinical trials may show that our potential drug compounds are ineffective and/or cause harmful side effects;\n\u25cf our potential drug compounds may prove to be too expensive to manufacture or administer to patients;\n\u25cf our potential drug compounds may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration or foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf even if our potential drug compounds are approved, we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs;\n\u25cf even if our potential drug compounds are approved, they may not achieve commercial acceptance;\n\u25cf regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to any of our potential drug compounds, which could adversely affect their commercial success; and\n\u25cf the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our potential collaborative partners from marketing our potential drug compounds.\nIf we fail to develop our potential drug compounds, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected, we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans and may be forced to cease operations.\nOur research and development plans will require substantial additional future funding which could impact our operations and financial condition. Without the required additional funds, we will likely cease operations.\nIt will take several years before we can develop potentially marketable products, if at all. Our research and development plans will require substantial additional capital, arising from costs to:\n\u25cf conduct research, non-clinical testing and human studies;\n\u25cf establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities; and\n\u25cf establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, finance and administrative capabilities to support these programs.\nOur future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs;\n\u25cf the scope and results of pre-clinical testing and human studies;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, securing, maintaining and enforcing patents;\n\u25cf competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf our ability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u25cf changes in our existing collaborations;\n\u25cf the cost of manufacturing scale-up; and\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our commercialization activities.\nWe base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables. Such uncertainties include the success of our research initiatives, regulatory approvals, the timing of events outside our direct control such as negotiations with potential strategic partners and other factors. Any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements as they determine such one-time events as the receipt or payment of major milestones and other payments.\nAdditional funds will be required to support our operations and if we are unable to obtain them on favorable terms, we may be required to cease or reduce further research and development of our drug product programs, sell some or all our intellectual property, merge with another entity or cease operations.\nIf we fail to demonstrate efficacy in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our research and development efforts will be greatly dependent upon our ability to demonstrate potential drug compound efficacy in non-clinical studies, as well as in clinical trials. Non-clinical studies involve testing potential drug compounds in appropriate non-human disease models to demonstrate efficacy and safety. Regulatory agencies evaluate these data carefully before they will approve clinical testing in humans. If certain non-clinical data reveals potential safety issues or the results are inconsistent with an expectation of the potential drug compound\u2019s efficacy in humans, the regulatory agencies may require additional more rigorous testing before allowing human clinical trials. This additional testing will increase program expenses and extend timelines. We may decide to suspend further testing on our potential drug compounds if, in the judgment of our management and advisors, the non-clinical test results do not support further development.\nMoreover, success in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and non-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our potential drug compounds are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a drug candidate and may delay development of other potential drug compounds. Any delay in, or termination of, our non-clinical testing or clinical trials will delay the filing of an IND and NDA with the Food and Drug Administration or the equivalent applications with pharmaceutical regulatory authorities outside the United States and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our potential drug compounds and generate product revenues. In addition, we expect that our early clinical trials will involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these early clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. Also, the IND process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay the development of our potential drug compounds. Moreover, positive results of non-clinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in subsequent clinical trials.\nFollowing successful non-clinical testing, potential drug compounds will need to be tested in a clinical development program to provide data on safety and efficacy prior to becoming eligible for product approval and licensure by regulatory agencies. From the first human trial through to regulatory approval can take many years and 10-12 years is not unusual for certain compounds.\nIf any of our future clinical development potential drug compounds become the subject of problems, our ability to sustain our development programs will become critically compromised. For example, efficacy or safety concerns may arise, whether or not justified, that could lead to the suspension or termination of our clinical programs. Examples of problems that could arise include, among others:\n\u25cf efficacy or safety concerns with the potential drug compounds, even if not justified;\n\u25cf manufacturing difficulties or concerns;\n\u25cf regulatory proceedings subjecting the potential drug compounds to potential recall;\n\u25cf publicity affecting doctor prescription or patient use of the potential drug compounds;\n\u25cf pressure from competitive products; or\n\u25cf introduction of more effective treatments.\nEach clinical phase is designed to test attributes of the drug and problems that might result in the termination of the entire clinical plan can be revealed at any time throughout the overall clinical program. The failure to demonstrate efficacy in our clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not obtain the support of qualified scientific collaborators, our revenue, growth and profitability will likely be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to establish relationships with leading scientists and research institutions. We believe that such relationships are pivotal to establishing products using our technologies as a standard of care for various indications. Additionally, although in discussion, there is no assurance that our current research partners will continue to work with us or that we will be able to attract additional research partners. If we are not able to establish scientific relationships to assist in our research and development, we may not be able to successfully develop our potential drug compounds. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop, market or generate sales of our products to the extent anticipated. Our business may fail and investors could lose all their investment in our Company.\nAssuming that we are successful in developing our potential drug compounds and receiving regulatory clearances to market our products, our ability to successfully penetrate the market and generate sales of those products may be limited by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf If our competitors receive regulatory approvals for and begin marketing similar products in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories before we do, greater awareness of their products as compared to ours will cause our competitive position to suffer;\n\u25cf Information from our competitors or the academic community indicating that current products or new products are more effective or offer compelling other benefits than our future products could impede our market penetration or decrease our future market share; and\n\u25cf The pricing and reimbursement environment for our future products, as well as pricing and reimbursement decisions by our competitors and by payers, may have an effect on our revenues.\nIf this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nNone of our potential drug compounds may reach the commercial market for a number of reasons and our business may fail.\nSuccessful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high risk. Most products and development candidates fail to reach the market. Our success depends on the discovery of new drug compounds that we can commercialize. It is possible that our products may never reach the market for a number of reasons. They may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side-effects during non-clinical testing or clinical trials or fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. We may find that certain products cannot be manufactured at a commercial scale and, therefore, they may not be economical to produce. Our potential products could also fail to achieve market acceptance or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties. Our patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property may be challenged, and this may delay or prohibit us from effectively commercializing our products. Furthermore, we do not expect our potential drug compounds to be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. If none of our potential drug compounds reach the commercial market, our business will likely fail and investors will lose all of their investment in our Company. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf our competitors succeed in developing products and technologies faster or that are more effective or with a better profile than our own, or if scientific developments change our understanding of the potential scope and utility of our potential products, then our technologies and future products may be rendered undesirable or obsolete.\nWe face significant competition from industry participants that are pursuing technologies in similar disease states to those that we are pursuing and are developing pharmaceutical products that are competitive with our products. Nearly all of our industry competitors have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staffs and facilities, and a longer history in drug discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval and pharmaceutical product manufacturing and marketing than we do. With these additional resources, our competitors may be able to respond to the rapid and significant technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than we can. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Rapid technological development, as well as new scientific developments, may result in our products becoming obsolete before we can recover any of the expenses incurred to develop them. For example, changes in our understanding of the appropriate population of patients who should be treated with a targeted therapy like we are developing may limit the drug\u2019s market potential if it is subsequently demonstrated that only certain subsets of patients should be treated with the targeted therapy.\nOur reliance on third parties, such as university laboratories, contract manufacturing organizations and contract or clinical research organizations, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, non-clinical testing or clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them.\nIn the course of product development, we may engage university laboratories, other biotechnology companies or contract or clinical manufacturing organizations to manufacture drug material for us to be used in non-clinical and clinical testing and contract research organizations to conduct and manage non-clinical and clinical studies. If we engage these organizations to help us with our non-clinical and clinical programs, many important aspects of this process have been and will be out of our direct control. If any of these organizations we may engage in the future fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform non-clinical testing and/or clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, we may face delays in completing our clinical trials, as well as commercialization of any of our potential drug compounds. Furthermore, any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials, regulatory filings and the potential market approval of our potential drug compounds.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to research and develop our potential drug compounds.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies or organizations for partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations. Collaborations include contracting with academic research institutions for the performance of specific scientific testing. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Since each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Other companies have already begun many drug development programs, which may target diseases that we are also targeting, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patent applications and patents that we may need for the development of our potential drug compounds. In some instances, we will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.\nThe use of any of our products in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims, which may cost us significant amounts of money to defend against or pay out, causing our business to suffer.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products. We currently have one drug compound in clinical trials, however, when any of our products enter clinical trials or become marketed products, they could potentially harm people or allegedly harm people possibly subjecting us to costly and damaging product liability claims. Some of the patients who participate in clinical trials are already ill when they enter a trial or may intentionally or unintentionally fail to meet the exclusion criteria. The waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation. Although we intend to obtain product liability insurance, which we believe is adequate, we are subject to the risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims. The insurance costs along with the defense or payment of liabilities above the amount of coverage could cost us significant amounts of money and management distraction from other elements of the business, causing our business to suffer.\nIf we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information through our information systems. Although we endeavor to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our business and employees. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures and organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our operations and would severely dilute existing or future investors if we were to raise funds at lower prices.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because our operations have been financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our continued operations. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. We believe the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate widely and could cause our common stock to trade at a price below the price at which you purchase your shares of common stock:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of new services, products, acquisitions or strategic relationships by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in accounting treatments or principles;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and in analyst recommendations; and\n\u25cf general political, economic, regulatory and market conditions.\nThe market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all such shares of common stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares of common stock will result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of common stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.\nTrading of our common stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nThere is currently a limited market for our common stock and the volume of our common stock traded on any day may vary significantly from one period to another. Trading in our stock is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The availability of buyers and sellers represented by this volatility could lead to a market price for our common stock that is unrelated to operating performance. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in the stock, in which case it could be difficult for our stockholders to resell their stock.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn October 21, 2015, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $50 million of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue 179,598 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee and shall issue up to 89,799 shares pro rata, when and if, Lincoln Park purchases at our discretion the $50 million aggregate commitment. The purchase shares sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period. The purchase price for shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park, except that, pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Lincoln Park, we would be unable to sell shares to Lincoln Park if and when the closing sale price of our common stock is below $3.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Additional sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all the shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and, after it has acquired shares, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our share price to fall.\nOn July 6, 2018, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to offer shares of our common stock from time to time through \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings, pursuant to which we offer and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million. To date, no offerings have occurred under this agreement. We are not obligated to make or continue to make any sale of shares of our common stock under the \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings. Although any sale of securities pursuant to the \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings will result in an increase in cash for each share sold, it may result in shareholder dilution and may cause our share price to fall.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates that we may pursue may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our intellectual property, particularly patents, in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates and technology. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates or by in-licensing intellectual property. U.S. patents related to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 are directed to a dosage form comprising certain doses of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and donepezil, and the coverage is limited to the United States only. We may not be able to obtain patent protection for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 as a single drug or in other jurisdictions.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing on third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe hold ownership or exclusive rights to four issued U.S. patent and nine U.S. or PCT patent applications with various international counterpart applications, all of which relate to drug candidates and methods associated therewith. Neither patents nor patent applications ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including the following:\n1. Competitors may interfere with our patenting process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that Anavex is not entitled to an issued patent for a variety of legal reasons. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing their patents and restrict our freedom to operate. If a court or, in some circumstances, a board of a national patent authority, agrees, we would lose some or all of our patent protection. As a company, we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our patents or patent applications.\n2. Because of the time, money and effort involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, our management may spend less time and resources on developing potential drug compounds than they otherwise would, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n3. Issuance of a patent may not provide significant practical protection. If we receive a patent of narrow scope, then it may be possible for competitors to design products that do not infringe our patent(s).\n4. Anavex is seeking patent protection for a number of indications, combination products and drug regimens. The lack of patent protection in global markets for a specific end product or indication may inhibit our ability to advance our compounds and may make Anavex less attractive to potential partners.\n5. Defending a patent lawsuit takes significant time and can be very expensive.\n6. If a court decides that an Anavex compound, its method of manufacture or use, infringes on the competitor\u2019s patent, we may have to pay substantial damages for infringement.\n7. A court may prohibit us from making, selling or licensing the potential drug compound unless the patent holder grants a license. A patent holder is not required to grant a license. If a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents, and the license terms may be unacceptable.\n8. Redesigning our potential drug compounds so that they do not infringe on other patents may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to an exclusive license agreement with Life Science Research Israel Ltd., with respect to certain in-licensed intellectual property related to our ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 product candidate, and we may need to obtain additional licenses from others in the future. Our license agreement with Life Science Research Israel Ltd. imposes, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various development, diligence, commercialization, and other obligations on us. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 or other product candidates covered by any such future licenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations.\nThe resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we do not obtain required intellectual property licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling potential drug compounds requiring these rights or licenses. There is also a risk that legal disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or potential drug compounds developed in collaboration with other parties, all with attendant risk, distraction, expense, and lack of predictability.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success will also depend in part on our ability to commercialize our compounds without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have not conducted extensive freedom of use patent searches and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could be issued which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. If our compounds or other subject matter are claimed under other United States patents or other international patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in a challenge or be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to succeed in a challenge, develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain needed licenses could be materially adverse. Adverse consequences include delays in marketing some or all of our potential drug compounds based on our drug technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of potential drug compounds requiring such licenses. If we defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease the research and development of our technology.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Additionally, parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nWhile we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nAlthough we are not currently involved in any litigation, we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Although we are not currently involved in any litigation, if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation or interference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates to market.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors\u2019 ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.", "PERMNO": 15776, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AVXL"}
