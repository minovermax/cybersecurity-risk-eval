{"cik": "1260968", "company": "MARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that\nwe currently are in substantial compliance with all material statutes and regulations\nthat are applicable to our business.\nCertain of the regulatory requirements that\nare applicable to Marlin Business Services Corp.,\nMBB and our other subsidiaries are\ndescribed below.\nThis description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation\nof such statutes and\nregulations and their effects on us and our subsidiaries and is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.\nBanking Regulation.\nOur subsidiary,\nMarlin Business Bank, is a Utah state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and is supervised\nby both the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions\n(the \u201cDepartment\u201d).\nWe are a registered\nbank\nholding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and are\nsupervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nWe elected to become\na financial holding company (while remaining a bank holding company)\nand the\nBank Holding Company Act, as modified by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct, permits us to engage in a wider range of financial\nactivities deemed to be \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d\nincluding lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, safeguarding\nmoney or\nsecurities, providing financial, investment or economic advisory\nservices and underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in\nsecurities.\nOur status as a financial holding company permits the Company to\nconduct reinsurance activities through our\nAssuranceOne subsidiary.\nFederal law provides the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC and\nthe Federal Reserve Board, with substantial enforcement\npowers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability\nto assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist\nor removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations\nand institution-affiliated parties. In general, these\nenforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations\nand unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions\nmay provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading\nor untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.\nFederal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks\nregulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their\ninvestments, their reserves against deposits, the payment of dividends,\nthe timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature\nand amount of and collateral for certain loans. There are periodic examinations\nby the Department and the FDIC to test our\ncompliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and\nsupervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities\nin which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for\nthe protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory\nstructure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection\nwith their supervisory and enforcement activities and\nexamination policies, including policies with respect to the classification\nof assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves\nfor regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether\nby the Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress\ncould have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nCapital Adequacy.\nThe Company and MBB operate under the Basel III capital adequacy standards\nadopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies\neffective on January 1, 2015, as modified by certain provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act that became fully effective on January 1,\n2019.\nUnder the risk-based capital requirements applicable to them, bank\nholding companies must maintain a ratio of total capital to risk-\nweighted assets (including the asset equivalent of certain off\n-balance sheet activities such as acceptances and letters of credit) of not\nless than 8% (10% in order to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d).\nThe requirements include a 6% minimum Tier\n1 risk-based ratio (8%\nto be considered well-capitalized). Tier 1 Capital,\nas defined in the implementing regulations, consists of common stock, related\nsurplus, retained earnings, qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority\ninterests in the equity accounts of certain consolidated\nsubsidiaries, after deducting goodwill and certain other intangibles.\nThe remainder of total capital (\u201cTier 2 Capital\u201d)\nmay consist of\ncertain perpetual debt securities, mandatory convertible debt securities, hybrid\ncapital instruments and limited amounts of\nsubordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, allowance for credit\nlosses on loans and leases, allowance for credit losses on off-\nbalance-sheet credit exposures and unrealized gains on equity securities. At December\n31, 2020,\nthe Company\u2019s Tier\n1 Capital and\ntotal capital ratios were 22.74% and 24.04%,\nrespectively.\nThe capital standards\nrequire a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The\ncapital requirements also now require a new common equity\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio with a required\nminimum of 4.5% (6.5%\nto be considered well-capitalized). The Federal Reserve\nBoard\u2019s guidelines also provide\nthat bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions\nare expected to\nmaintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory\nlevels without significant reliance on intangible assets.\nFurthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue\nto consider a \u201ctangible tier 1 leverage ratio\u201d (\ni.e.\n,\nafter deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion\nor new activities.\nMBB is subject to similar capital standards. At\nDecember 31, 2020,\nthe Company\u2019s leverage and common\nequity ratios were 18.78% and 22.74%,\nrespectively.\nThe Company is required to have a level of regulatory capital in excess of\nthe regulatory minimum and to have a capital buffer above\n2.5% for 2020 and thereafter.\nIf a banking organization does not maintain capital above\nthe minimum plus the capital conservation\nbuffer it may be subject to restrictions on dividends, share buybacks,\nand certain discretionary payments such as bonus payments.\nPrompt Corrective Action\n.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991\n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires federal regulators to take prompt\ncorrective action against any undercapitalized institution.\nFive capital categories have been established under federal banking\nregulations: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,\nsignificantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\nWell-capitalized\ninstitutions significantly exceed the required minimum level for\neach relevant capital measure.\nAdequately\ncapitalized institutions include depository institutions that meet but do not\nsignificantly exceed the required minimum level for each\nrelevant capital measure. Undercapitalized institutions consist of those\nthat fail to meet the required minimum level for one or more\nrelevant capital measures.\nSignificantly undercapitalized depository institutions consist of those with capital\nlevels significantly below\nthe minimum requirements for any relevant capital measure.\nCritically undercapitalized depository institutions are those with minimal\ncapital and at serious risk for government seizure.\nUnder certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized\nor undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the\ninstitution were in the next lower capital category.\nA depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends, or paying management fees to a holding company\nif the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.\nInstitutions that are adequately capitalized but not well-capitalized\ncannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a\nwaiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that\ncan be paid on such deposits.\nUndercapitalized\ninstitutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies are permitted or,\nin certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions\nfalling within one of the three undercapitalized categories.\nDepending on the level of an institution\u2019s\ncapital, the agency\u2019s corrective\npowers include, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibiting\nthe\npayment\nof\nprincipal\nand\ninterest\non\nsubordinated\ndebt;\n\u2022\nprohibiting\nthe\nholding\ncom\npany\nfrom\nmaking\ndistributions\nwithout\nprior\nregulatory\napproval;\n\u2022\nplacing\nlimits\non\nasset\ngrowth\nand\nrestrictions\non\nactivities;\n\u2022\nplacing\nadditional\nrestrictions\non\ntransactions\nwith\naffiliates;\n\u2022\nrestricting\nthe\ninterest\nrate\nth\ne\ninstitution\nmay\npay\non\ndeposits;\n\u2022\nprohibiting\nthe\ninstitution\nfrom\naccepting\ndeposits\nfrom\ncorrespondent\nbanks;\nand\n\u2022\nin\nthe\nmost\nsevere\ncases,\nappointing\na\nconservator\nor\nreceiver\nfor\nthe\ninstitution.\nA banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capit\nal restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted\nunless, among other things, the banking institution\u2019s\nholding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount.\nAny such\nguarantee from a depository institution\u2019s\nholding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.\nMBB\u2019s Tier 1 Capital\nbalance was $148.3 million at December 31, 2020,\nresulting in a Tier 1 leverage ratio, common\nequity Tier 1 risk based ratio, Tier\nrisk-based capital ratio and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.26%\n,\n18.23%,\n18.23% and 19.53%, respectively,\nwhich exceeded the\nregulatory requirements for well-capitalized status of 5%, 6.5%, 8% and\n10%, respectively.\nPursuant to the FDIC Agreement entered into in conjunction with the opening\nof MBB, MBB was required to keep its total risk-based\ncapital ratio above 15%. On March 25, 2020, MBB received notice from\nthe FDIC that it had approved MBB\u2019s request to\nrescind\ncertain nonstandard conditions in the FDIC\u2019s\norder granting federal deposit insurance issued on March 20, 2007. Furthermore,\neffective March 26, 2020, the FDIC, the Company\nand certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries terminated\nthe Capital Maintenance and\nLiquidity Agreement (the \u201cCMLA Agreement\u201d) and the Parent Company\nAgreement, each entered into by and among the Company,\ncertain of its subsidiaries and the FDIC in conjunction with the opening of\nMBB. As a result of these actions, MBB is no longer\nrequired pursuant to the CMLA Agreement to maintain a total risk-based capital\nratio above 15%. Rather, MBB must continue\nto\nmaintain a total risk-based capital ratio above 10% in order to maintain\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status as defined by banking regulations,\nwhile the Company must continue to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio as discussed\nin the preceding paragraphs.\nThe federal banking agencies\u2019 final regulatory capital rules, discussed above,\nalso modify the above prompt corrective action\nrequirements to add a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio requirement,\nand increase certain other capital requirements for the\nvarious prompt corrective action thresholds. For example, the requirements\nfor a bank to be considered well-capitalized under the\nrules are a 5.0% tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio,\nan 8.0% tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0%\ntotal risk-based capital ratio. To\nbe adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\nFederal Deposit Insurance.\nThe deposits of MBB are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) and are backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The Dodd-Frank Act increased\ndeposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As\ninsurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct\nexaminations of, and to require reporting by,\ninsured institutions. It also may prohibit any\ninsured institution from engaging in any activity determined by\nregulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also\nhas the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions.\nThe FDIC\u2019s risk-based premium\nsystem for FDIC deposit insurance is governed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nReform Act of\n2005, as amended by certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nFDIC changed its risk-based premium system for FDIC deposit\ninsurance which now includes quarterly assessments of FDIC-insured\ninstitutions based on their respective rankings in one of four risk\ncategories depending upon their examination ratings and capital ratios.\nThe FDIC capital assessment base now includes\nconsolidated\ntotal assets minus tangible equity capital, defined as Tier\n1 Capital. Institutions in FDIC-assigned Risk Categories II, III and IV are\nassessed premiums at progressively higher rates.\nThe Dodd Frank Act raised the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance\nFund from 1.15% to 1.35% and requires the FDIC to\noffset the effect of this increase on insured institutions\nwith assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions).\nSmall institutions will\nreceive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed\nto growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%.\nWhen the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small\nbank's credits to reduce its regular assessment\nup to the entire amount of the assessment.\nIf the reserve ratio exceeds 1.5%, the FDIC must dividend to DIF members the amount\nabove the amount necessary to maintain the DIF at 1.5%, but the FDIC Board\nof Directors may, in\nits sole discretion, suspend or limit\nthe declaration of payment of dividends.\nSource of Strength\nDoctrine\n.\nUnder the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as Federal Reserve Board\npolicy and regulation, a bank holding company must\nserve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary\nbanks and is expected to stand prepared to commit\nresources to support each of them.\nConsistent with this policy,\nthe Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent\nbanking, a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate\nof cash dividends unless its net income available to\ncommon shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund\nthe dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be\nconsistent with the organization\u2019s\ncapital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.\nNational Monetary Policy\n.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions,\nthe earnings and growth of the Company and MBB are affected\nby the\npolicies of the Federal Reserve Board.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply\nand credit\nconditions.\nAmong the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives\nare open market operations in\nU.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes\nin reserve requirements against bank deposits.\nThese\ninstruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic\ngrowth and the distribution of credit, bank loans,\ninvestments and deposits.\nTheir use also affects interest rates charged on\nloans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board\nhave had a significant effect on the operating results of\ncommercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\nThe effects of such policies upon our future business,\nearnings and growth cannot be predicted.\nDividends\n.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued policy statements requiring\ninsured banks and bank holding companies to have an established\nassessment process for maintaining capital commensurate with their\noverall risk profile. Such assessment process may affect the\nability of the organizations to pay dividends. Although\ngenerally organizations may pay dividends only out of\ncurrent operating\nearnings, dividends may be paid if the distribution is prudent relative to the organization\u2019s\nfinancial position and risk profile, after\nconsideration of current and prospective economic conditions. MBB\u2019s\nability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to various\nregulatory requirements, including Title\n12 part 208 of the Code of Federal Regulations (12 CFR 208.5), which places limitations\non\nbank dividends. Such limitations applicable to MBB include requiring\nthe approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the payment of\ndividends by the bank subsidiary in any calendar year if the total of all dividends\ndeclared by the bank in that calendar year, including\nthe proposed dividend, exceeds the current year\u2019s\nnet income combined with the retained net income for the two preceding calendar\nyears. \u201cRetained net income\u201d for any period means the net income for that period\nless any common or preferred stock dividends\ndeclared in that period. Moreover, no dividends\nmay be paid by such bank in excess of its undivided profits account.\nFurthermore, as\ndiscussed under \u201c\nSource of Strength Doctrine\n\u201d, as a bank holding company, the\nCompany\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders\nis also subject to various regulatory requirements, including Supervisory\nLetter SR 09-4, Applying Supervisory Guidance and\nRegulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions and Stock\nRepurchases at Bank Holding Companies.\nTransfers of Funds and Transactions\nwith Affiliates.\nRegulations governing the Company and its affiliates,\nincluding sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, impose restrictions\non MBB that limit the transfer of funds by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp.\nand certain of its affiliates, in the form of loans,\nextensions of credit, investments or purchases of assets. These transfers by\nMBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. or any other\nsingle affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of MBB\u2019s\ncapital and surplus, and transfers to all affiliates are limited\nin the aggregate to\n20% of MBB\u2019s capital and surplus.\nThese loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral\nrequirements. These\nregulations also require generally that MBB\u2019s\ntransactions with its affiliates be on terms no\nless favorable to MBB than comparable\ntransactions with unrelated third parties.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978,\nas amended, prohibits a person or group of persons from\nacquiring \"control\" of a bank holding company unless the FDIC has been\nnotified 60 days prior to such acquisition and has not\nobjected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption\nin the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a\nclass of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered\nunder Section 12 of the 1934 Act, such as the\nCompany, would, under\nthe circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control\nof the bank holding company.\nThe regulations provide a procedure for challenging this rebuttable control\npresumption.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket (NASDAQ)\n.\nWe are also subject\nto regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand certain state securities commissions\nfor matters relating to the offering and sale of our securities. We\nare subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, as administered by the Securities and\nExchange Commission. We\nare listed on NASDAQ under the trading symbol \u201cMRLN,\u201d and we are\nsubject to the rules of NASDAQ\nfor listed companies.\nOther Regulations.\nAlthough most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment\nfinancing business, certain states require lenders and finance\ncompanies to be licensed, impose limitations on certain contract terms and\non interest rates and other charges, mandate disclosure of\ncertain contract terms and constrain collection practices and remedies.\nIn addition to state licensing requirements, we are required to comply with\nvarious laws and requirements that protect credit applicants\nor are otherwise applicable to financial institutions, including\nbut not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires financial institutions to maintain\nprivacy regarding credit application data in our\npossession and to periodically communicate with certain customers\non privacy matters;\n\u25cf\nUSA Patriot Act of 2001, which requires financial institutions, including our banking\nsubsidiary, to assist in the prevention,\ndetection and prosecution of money laundering and the financing of terrorism;\n\u25cf\nTelephone\nConsumer Protection Act of 1991, which protects from unwanted auto-dialed or pre\n-recorded telemarketing calls;\n\u25cf\nFair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (\u201cFACT\nAct\u201d), which requires financial institutions to establish a written\nprogram\nto implement \u201cRed Flag Guidelines,\u201d which are intended to detect,\nprevent and mitigate identity theft. The FACT\nAct also\nprovides guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user\nof consumer credit reports must employ when a\nconsumer reporting agency sends the user a notice of address discrepancy;\n\u25cf\nFair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information\nrelated to the credit history of certain credit\napplicants;\nand\n\u25cf\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination\non the basis of age, race and certain other\ncharacteristics in the extension of credit and require that we provide notice to credit\napplicants of their right to receive a\nwritten statement of reasons for declined credit applications.\nOur insurance operations are subject to various\ntypes of governmental regulation. Our wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary,\nAssuranceOne, is a Class 3 Bermuda insurance company and, as such, is subject\nto the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and\nrelated regulations.\nSeasonality\nThe products and services we provide to our customers include loans and leases for\nthe acquisition of commercial equipment and\nworking capital loans.\nOur business activities are not seasonal in nature.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe our\nsuccess depends on the strength of our workforce. The Chief Human Resources\nOfficer (\"CHRO\") is responsible for\ndeveloping and executing our human capital strategy.\nThis includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on\nthe Company\u2019s strategy as well as the design\nof employee compensation and benefits programs.\nWe recognize\nthat attracting,\nmotivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success.\nWe offer\nindustry competitive wages and benefits and\nare committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes\nemployee productivity and satisfaction.\nWe manage\nthe business through establishing operational and financial goals that are\nfocused on achieving our organization-wide\ninitiatives.\nThose goals are focused for the leadership of each department, and then\ncascaded through the levels of the organization.\nLike many companies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially challenging\nas we focused our health and safety efforts on\nprotecting our employees and families from potential virus exposure\nwhile continuing to maintain our operations and support our\ncustomers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our employees have been\nworking remotely, and we have\nnot experienced any\nsignificant interruptions to our operations from that transition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed 254 people. None of our employees are\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement and\nwe\nhave never experienced any work stoppages.\nAvailable Information\nWe are a Pennsylvania\ncorporation with our principal executive offices located\nat 300 Fellowship Road, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054. Our\ntelephone number is (888) 479-9111\nand our website address is www.marlincapitalsolutions\n.com.\nWe make available\nfree of charge\nthrough the investor relations section of our website our Annual Reports\non Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current\nreports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably\npracticable after such material is electronically filed\nwith or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The\nSEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov\nthat contains our\nreports, proxy and information statements, and other information that we\nelectronically file with the SEC. We\ninclude the above\nwebsite addresses in this Annual Report on Form 10-K only as inactive textual\nreferences\nand do not intend them to be active links\nto\nsuch websites.\nItem 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission are risks\nand uncertainties, not limited to the risks set forth below,\nthat could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results\ncontemplated by the forward-looking statements contained\nin this report and other periodic statements we make.\nCOVID-19 Related\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, and such effects\nwill depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and are difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related\ngovernment actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus\nhave been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak\nhas significantly increased\neconomic uncertainty and\nreduced economic activity.\nThe pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures\nto try to contain the virus, such\nas travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock\n-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such\nmeasures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment\nand negatively impacted consumer and business spending. The\nUnited States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of\nthe more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus,\nincluding the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), but there can be no assurance that\nsuch steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in\na timely fashion.\nWe continue to monitor\nand evaluate newly enacted\nand proposed government and banking regulations issued in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic; further changes in regulation that\nimpact our business or that impact our customers could have a significant\nimpact on our future operations and business strategies.\nOur operations and financial results have already been negatively\nimpacted as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed further in\n\u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n-Overview\u201d and \u201c-\nResults of Operations\u201d.\nThe pandemic, reduction in economic activity,\nand current business limitations and shutdowns have increased\nrisks to our business that include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nPortfolio Risk.\nWe experienced\na significant decrease in demand for our lease and loan products during\nthe year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have limited\nvisibility to the future recovery of such demand.\nOur origination volumes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $367.1 million\n,\na 54% decrease from $801.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019.\nWe have shifted\nthe focus of portions of our operations and certain personnel to implement specific\nprograms and new products in\nresponse to the pandemic.\nIn particular, we have focused efforts on\nloan modifications and a payment deferral program,\nimplemented a new PPP loan product, and increased customer service\nefforts to respond to our borrower\u2019s needs.\nWe modified\nover 5,600 contracts as part of our payment deferral program, representing\n$111.2 million, or\n12.8% of our Net investment in\nleases and loans as of December 31, 2020.\nWhile 92% of the modified contracts are out of the deferral period at year end, as part\nof our loss mitigation strategies we are further extending the deferral\nperiod for select customers in industries that are suffering\nprolonged impacts of COVID-19.\nThere can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful in mitigating\nany risk of credit\nloss.\n\u25cf\nCredit Risk.\nWe extend credit primarily\nto small and mid-sized businesses, and many of our customers may be particularly\nsusceptible to business limitations, shutdowns and possible recessions and\nmay be unable to make scheduled lease or loan\npayments during these periods and may be at risk of discontinuing\ntheir operations.\nAs a result, our delinquencies and credit\nlosses may substantially increase.\nOur risk and exposure to future losses may be amplified to the extent\neconomic activity\nremains shutdown for an extended period, or to the extent businesses have limited\noperations or are unable to return to normal\nlevels of activity after the restrictions are lifted.\nOur estimate of expected future credit losses recognized within our\nallowance as of December 31, 2020 is based on certain\nassumptions, forecasts and estimates about the impact of current economic\nconditions on our portfolio of receivables based on\ninformation known as of that date, including certain expectations about\nthe extent and timing of impacts from COVID-19.\nIf\nthose assumptions, forecasts or estimates underlying our financial statements are\nincorrect, we may experience significant losses\nas the ultimate realization of value, or revisions to our estimates, may\nbe materially different than the amounts reflected in our\nconsolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\n\u25cf\nLiquidity and Capital Risk.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios, and our subsidiary bank\u2019s\ncapital ratios, were in\nexcess of all regulatory requirements.\nWhile we currently have sufficient capital, our reported and\nregulatory capital ratios could\nbe adversely impacted by further credit losses and other COVID-19\nrelated impacts on our operations.\nWe are managing the\nevolving risks of our business while closely monitoring and forecasting the\npotential impacts of COVID-19 on our future\noperations and financial position, including capital levels.\nHowever, given the uncertainty about\nfuture developments and the\nextent and duration of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and\nfuture operations, we face elevated risks to our ability to\nforecast and estimate future capital levels.\nIf we fail to meet capital requirements in the future, our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur capital markets sale and syndication activities provide a source of liquidity\nand have enabled us to manage the size and\ncomposition of leases and loans on our balance sheet.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $28.3 million of assets that\ngenerated a net pre-tax gain on sale of $2.4 million.\nIn comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $310.4\nmillion of assets for pre-tax gain on sale of $22.2 million.\nDisruptions in the capital markets due to the impact of COVID-19\npandemic on the economic environment resulted in a lack of demand\nin the syndication\nmarket since the end of the first quarter of\n2020 and we retained substantially all of our origination volume on our balance\nsheet.\nOur sales execution decisions, including\nthe timing, volume and frequency of such sales, depend on many factors including\nour origination volumes, the characteristics of\nour contracts versus market requirements, our current assessment of our balance\nsheet composition and capital levels, and current\nmarket conditions, among other factors.\nDriven by the continued market disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe\nmay have difficulty accessing the capital market\nand may find decreased interest and ability of counterparties to purchase our\ncontracts, or we may be unable to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nWe have historically\nreturned capital to shareholders through normal dividends, special dividends\nand share repurchases. There\ncan be no assurances that these forms of capital returns are the optimal use of our capital\nor that they will continue in the future.\n\u25cf\nOperational Risk.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including\nimplementing certain\nbusiness continuity plans, and developing work from home and social\ndistancing plans for our employees), and we may take\nfurther actions as may be required by government authorities or as we\ndetermine are in the best interests of our employees,\ncustomers and business partners.\nWe face increased\nrisk of any operational or procedural failures due to changes in our normal\nbusiness practices necessitated by the pandemic.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time\nand may continue to adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas subsided.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, results of operations\nand financial condition will depend on\nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult\nto predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of\nthe outbreak, its severity,\nthe actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what exten\nt\nnormal economic and\noperating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse\nimpacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s\nglobal economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on\nour\nliquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect\nthe spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have,\nand, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain\nand subject to change. We\ndo not yet know the full extent of\nthe impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy\nas a whole. However, the effects could have\na material impact on\nour results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described herein.\nRegulations\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business.\nFurther changes in regulations that impact our business may have\na\nsignificant impact on our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated, and such regulations are\nintended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal\ndeposit insurance\nfunds, not shareholders. Since becoming a bank holding company on\nJanuary 13, 2009, we have been subject to\nregulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nand subject to the Bank Holding Company\nAct. Our bank subsidiary,\nMBB, is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board of San\nFrancisco, and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.\nSuch regulation affects lending practices, capital structure, investment\npractices, dividend policy and growth.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 resulted in U.S. government and regulatory\nagencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the\nfinancial services industry,\nwhich have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions,\noversight and costs. In particular, the\nDodd-Frank Act substantially increased regulation of the financial\nservices industry,\nchanged deposit insurance provisions, and\nimpacted the ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent\nwith historical practices, including in the areas of\ncompensation, interest rates, financial product offerings\nand disclosures, among other things.\nNew proposals for legislation continue\nto be introduced in Congress that could further substantially increase regulation\nof the financial services industry and impose\nrestrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the\nindustry to conduct business consistent with historical practices,\nincluding in the areas of compensation, interest rates and financial product\nofferings and disclosures, among other things. Federal and\nstate regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their reg\nulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are\napplied. Such proposed changes in laws, regulations and regulatory\npractices affecting the banking industry or affecting\nthe equipment\nfinancing, telemarketing and collecting processes, may\nlimit the manner in which we conduct our business. Such changes may\nadversely affect us, including our ability to execute our\nstrategies, and originate loans and leases, and may also result in the imposition\nof additional costs on us.\nWe, like other\nfinance companies, face the risk of litigation, including class action litigation, and regulatory\ninvestigations and actions\nin connection with our business activities. These matters may be difficult\nto assess or quantify, and\ntheir magnitude may remain\nunknown for substantial periods of time. A substantial legal liability or\na significant regulatory action against us could cause us to\nsuffer significant costs and expenses and could require us\nto alter our business strategy and the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions,\nour earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal\nReserve Board.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply\nand credit conditions.\nAmong\nthe instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives\nare open market operations in U.S. government\nsecurities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements\nagainst bank deposits.\nThese instruments are used in\nvarying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution\nof credit, bank loans, investments and deposits.\nTheir\nuse also affects interest rates charged on\nloans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board\nhave had a significant effect on the operating results of bank\nholding companies in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\nThe effects of such policies upon our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nFurther increase in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or required reserves may\nhave a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions up\nto certain limits and charges insured financial institutions\npremiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).\nIn the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and\nensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of\nthe DIF. The FDIC is required\nby law to maintain adequate\nfunding of the DIF,\nand the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s\nreserves against future losses, which will necessitate increased deposit\ninsurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater\nthan $10 billion.\nFuture increases in insurance\npremiums may decrease our earnings and could require us to alter our business strategy\nand the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness.\nThe total risk-based capital ratio that MBB is required to maintain is currently\nset forth in the FDIC Agreement entered into in\nconjunction with the opening of the bank, as discussed further in -Item 7,\nLiquidity and Capital Resources-Bank Capital and\nRegulatory Oversight.\nWe could become subject\nto more stringent capital requirements, and such requirements could, among\nother\nthings, result in lower returns\non equity, could limit our\nability to make distributions to shareholders, require the raising of additional\ncapital, require us to significantly change our funding strategies or operations,\nand could result in regulatory actions if we were to be\nunable to comply with such requirements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are reliant on debt\nfinancing to operate our business.\nIf we cannot issue deposits or obtain other suitable sources of financing,\nwe may be unable to fund our\noperations.\nFurthermore, if the cost of debt financing increases, we may not be able to increase the\nassociated pricing of our leases and loans, which could adversely impact our results of\noperations, cash flows and financial\nposition\nOur business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate. Our cash\nrequirements will increase as our lease and loan originations\nincrease. We obtain\na substantial amount of the cash required for operations through a variety of external\nfunding sources, such as\ndeposits raised by MBB, long-term note securitizations and capital markets\nactivities including sales and syndications of leases and\nloans. A failure to access the deposits market or to add new funding facilities could\naffect our ability to fund and originate new leases\nand loans.\nOur ability to obtain continued access to the deposits market or to obtain\na renewal of our lender\u2019s commitment and new funding\nfacilities is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nconditions in the market for FDIC-insured deposits;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and costs associated with banking industry regulation which\ncould negatively impact MBB;\n\u2022\nconditions in the long-term lending markets; and\n\u2022\nour ability to service the leases and loans.\nWe are and\nwill continue to be dependent upon these funding sources to continue to originate leases and\nloans and to satisfy our other\nworking capital needs. We\nmay be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as a result\nof prevailing interest\nrates or other factors at the time, including the presence of covenants or other\nrestrictions under existing financing arrangements. If\nany or all of our funding sources become unavailable on acceptable terms or\nat all, we may not have access to the financing necessary\nto conduct our business, which would limit our ability to fund our operations.\nIn the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our\nshareholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of\nadditional equity securities. This dilution may be significant\ndepending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which\nwe issue such securities.\nWe rely on the sale of finance\nreceivables to third parties in the capital markets as an important source of our liquidity.\nIf such\narrangements become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement\nfinancing on economically viable terms, if at all.\nOur capital markets sale and syndication activities provide a source of liquidity\nand have enabled us to manage the size and\ncomposition of leases and loans on our balance sheet.\nOur ability to continue to execute syndications is affected\nby a number of\nfactors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to originate assets with characteristics that meet market demand;\n\u2022\nthe interest and ability of counterparties to purchase our contracts, and\nour ability to maintain relationships with such\ncounterparties;\n\u2022\ncurrent market conditions, including interest rate levels; and\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020,\nwe sold $28.3 million of assets that generated a net pre-tax gain on sale of $2.\nmillion.\nIn\ncomparison, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $310.4\nmillion of assets for pre-tax gain on sale of $22.2 million.\nDisruptions in the capital markets due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic\non the economic environment resulted in a lack of\ndemand in the syndication market since the end of the first quarter of 2020\nand we retained substantially all of our origination volume\non our balance sheet.\nDriven by the continued market disruptions resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, we may have difficulty\naccessing the capital market and may find decreased interest and ability of\ncounterparties to purchase our contracts, or we may be\nunable to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nAny disruption in our ability to access the syndication market due to COVID-19 pandemic,\nor any other market disruptions, could negatively affect\nour revenues, and may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations and\ncash flows.\nIn addition, if we fail to originate assets with suitable characteristics to satisfy market\nrequirements, or if our counterparties\u2019\nunderwriting criteria or interest in acquiring our contracts declines, we may\nbe unable to find replacement funding sources for these\nassets.\nThe execution of syndications that are accounted for as sales result in the derecognition\nof the assets, and the recognition of a gain (or\nloss) on the sale date, to the extent the proceeds received are in excess of the\nvalue of the transferred assets and/or any liability\nincurred.\nWe may have continuing\ninvolvement in the contracts sold to syndication through servicing the contracts sold,\nand/or\nthrough any recourse obligations that may include customary representations\nand warranties or specific recourse provisions.\nWe\ngenerally do not retain credit risk on loans sold, but we are exposed to risk\nto the extent that we violate such representations and\nwarranties, and we may be required to repurchase loans and leases, which\ncould impact our cashflows and ability to fund our\noperations.\nWe are subject to regulatory\ncapital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines, our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to raise additional\ncapital in the future, but that capital may\nnot be available when it is needed.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory\nrequirements, we must meet guidelines that include quantitative\nmeasures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance\nsheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components,\nrisk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum\ncapital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if we fail to maintain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status\nunder the regulatory framework, if we are deemed to be not well-managed\nunder regulatory exam procedures or if we experience\ncertain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company,\nour related eligibility for a streamlined review process for\nacquisition proposals and our ability to offer certain financial\nproducts may be compromised or impaired.\nWe may require\nadditional capital to fund our operations, driven by changes in required regulatory\ncapital levels, changes in the\navailability of our funding sources, changes in our business strategies, and\nchanges in market conditions, among other factors.\nAs a\nresult, we may need to suspend or discontinue our share repurchase\nprogram or any practice of declaring regular quarterly dividends\nin\norder to retain more capital on our Balance sheets.\nIn addition, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our\noperations.\nOur ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets\nat that time, which are\noutside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly,\nwe may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed,\non terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed,\nwe may become subject to adverse regulatory\nactions or restrictions, and limitations on growth of our operations.\nIn addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our\nshareholders\u2019 interests in us could be diluted.\nFor further information on our required capital levels, see \u201c-Item 1.\nBusiness. Supervision and Regulation\u201d and see \u201c-Item 7.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. Bank Capital and Regulatory Oversight\u201d\nin this Form 10-K.\nIf interest rates change significantly, we may be\nsubject to higher interest costs with respect to our funding sources, which may\ncause us to suffer material\nlosses.\nBecause we use FDIC insured deposits to fund our leases, our margins could\nbe reduced by an increase in interest rates. Each of our\nleases is structured so that the sum of all scheduled lease payments will equal\nthe cost of the equipment to us, less the residual, plus a\nreturn on the amount of our investment. Generally our leases and loans are\nfixed-rate in nature.\nWhen we originate or acquire leases,\nwe base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the yield on\neach lease and the effective interest rate we expect\nto pay when we finance the lease. To\nthe extent that a lease is financed with variable-rate funding from deposits or\nborrowings,\nincreases in interest rates during the term of a lease could narrow or eliminate\nthe spread, or result in a negative spread.\nA negative\nspread is an interest cost greater than the yield on the lease. If interest rates increase\nfaster than we are able to adjust the pricing under\nour new leases or loans, our net interest margin would be reduced.\nIn addition, with respect to our fixed-rate deposits and borrowings,\nincreases in interest rates could have the effect of increasing\nour costs on future transactions.\nCredit and Portfolio Risk\nIf we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our small business customers,\nwe may\nexperience a higher number of lease and\nloan defaults, which may restrict our access to funding and reduce our earnings.\nWe specialize in leasing\nand financing equipment and providing working capital to small and mid\n-sized businesses. Small and mid-\nsized businesses may be more vulnerable than large\nbusinesses to economic downturns, as they typically depend on the management\ntalents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons and\noften need substantial additional capital to expand or compete. Small\nand mid-sized business leases and loans, therefore, may entail a greater\nrisk of delinquencies and defaults than leases and loans\nentered\ninto with larger leasing customers. In addition, there is typically only\nlimited publicly available financial and other information\nabout small and mid-sized businesses and they often do not have\naudited financial statements. Accordingly,\nin making credit\ndecisions, our underwriting guidelines rely upon the accuracy of information\nabout these small and mid-sized businesses obtained\nfrom the small and mid-sized business owner and/or third-party sources,\nsuch as credit reporting agencies. If the information we\nobtain from small and mid-sized business owners and/or third-party\nsources is incorrect or fraudulent, our ability to make appropriate\ncredit decisions will be impaired. If we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness\nof our small business customers, we may experience a\nhigher number of lease and loan defaults and related decreases in our\nearnings.\nWe rely on information\nprovided by our customers and vendors.\nIf the information that we rely upon is not accurate, or if it was\nprovided with fraudulent or malicious intent, we may not make\nappropriate credit decisions and our financial position, operating\nresults and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nCustomer and vendor fraud have always been risks inherent to the equipment\nfinance business. We have\ntaken measures to detect and\nreduce the risk of fraud, including the implementation of new antifraud\ntools, increased vendor surveillance staff and enhancements\nto\nprocedures, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not\nbe effective against new and continually evolving forms\nof fraud. If we experience increases in fraudulent activity,\nor if our anti-fraud measures are not effective, we could experience\nan\nincrease in the level of our fraud charge-offs,\nadversely affecting the results of operations.\nThis could also lead to increased regulatory\nscrutiny, which\ncould adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nThese impacts, as well as the implementation of any necessary\nmeasures to reduce fraud risk could increase our costs and adversely impact\nour results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain\nour relationships with origination partners and our existing customers our ability\nto\ngenerate lease and loan\ntransactions and related revenues may be significantly\nimpeded.\nWe have formed\nrelationships with thousands of origination partners, comprised primarily\nof independent equipment dealers. We\nrely\non these relationships to generate lease and loan applications and\noriginations. Most of these relationships are not formalized in\nwritten agreements, and those that are formalized by written agreements\nare typically terminable at will. Our typical relationship does\nnot commit the origination partner to provide a minimum number of lease and\nloan transactions to us nor does it require the\norigination partner to direct all of its lease and loan transactions to us. The\ndecision by a significant number of our origination partners\nto refer their leasing transactions to another company could impede our\nability to generate lease and loan transactions and related\nrevenues.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity could result in a decline in our customer\ngrowth and our business could suffer\n.\nOur reputation is important to attract new customers as well as to obtain repeat\nbusiness from existing customers. There can be no\nassurance that we will continue to maintain a good relationship with our customers\nor avoid negative publicity.\nAny damage to our\nreputation, whether arising from our conduct of business, negative publicity,\nregulatory, supervisory\nor enforcement actions, matters\naffecting our financial reporting or compliance with Securities and\nExchange Commission and NASDAQ listing requirements,\nsecurity breaches or otherwise could have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our business strategy,\nwe may suffer material\noperating losses.\nOur financial position, liquidity and results of operations depend\non management\u2019s ability to execute our\nbusiness strategies.\nOur\nobjective to transition from a micro-ticket equipment lessor into a nationwide\nprovider of capital solutions to small businesses,\nincludes the following priorities:\na focus on strategically expanding our target market; better leveraging\nour capital and fixed cost\nbase through origination and portfolio growth, improving our operating\nefficiency,\nand proactively managing our risk profile.\nThe economic fallout from the pandemic caused a reduction in demand\nfor financing in our target market.\nThe tightening of our\nunderwriting standards and the re-organization of\nour origination platform caused further pressure on our origination activities in the\nwake of the pandemic.\nExecuting the expansion of our target market and growth of our or\niginations and portfolio depends on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding executing the acceleration of our automation and digital\ninitiatives, achieving the desired volume of\nleases and loans of suitable yield and credit quality,\neffectively managing those leases and loans, obtaining appropriate\nfunding, the\ncompetitive environment, and changes to our industry,\nmarket and general economic conditions.\nAccomplishing such a result on a\ncost-effective basis is largely a function of our\nmarketing capabilities, our management of the leasing process, our credit underwriting\nguidelines, our ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient\nservicing to our origination partners and our small business\ncustomers, our ability to execute effective credit risk management\nand collection techniques, our access to financing sources on\nacceptable terms, our ability to create an automated customer experience through\nour accelerated digital initiative and our ability to\nattract and retain high quality employees in all areas of our business.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be successful in our\ngrowth and expansion strategies, or that such measures will improve our\noperating efficiency,\nor that such measures will improve our\noperating results, cashflows or financial position.\nTo proactively\nmanage our risk profile, we continually monitor and analyze the performance of\nour portfolio, assess our delinquency\nand credit loss experience against our underwriting criteria and determine\nwhether our performance is commensurate with our\nintended risk tolerance.\nWe may make adjustments\nin response to such analysis to tighten or loosen our underwriting criteria, or\nto\nadjust borrower guarantee requirements, among other measures.\nFor example, in 2020 we made continual adjustments based on our\nassessments of the appropriate risk profile for different\ngeographies and industries based on the changing economic climate driven by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny such changes to our risk profile may not have the intended outcome on our portfolio\u2019s\nperformance,\nand our results of operations, cashflows, and financial position.\nTo the extent that we tighten our standards,\nwe risk not being not\ncompetitive in the market and losing origination volume.\nTo the extent that we loosen our standards,\nwe risk incurring credit losses in\nexcess of our expectations.\nAs part of our growth and market expansion strategies, we may evaluate\nopportunities for business combinations from time to time.\nWe completed\nthe acquisitions of Horizon Keystone Financial in January 2017, and Fleet Financing\nResources in September 2018, as\npart of our strategies to grow through acquisitions that extend our business into\nnew and attractive markets.\nAny such business\ncombinations entail numerous risks, including risks related to:\n(i) integrating the acquired operations, services and products;\n(ii)\nachieving expected synergies, including infrastructure\ncosts; (iii) acquisition-related costs or amortization cost for acquired intangible\nassets, that could impact our operating results;\n(iv) retention of customer and supplier relationships of the acquired business; (v)\ndiverting management attention from our ongoing business; and (vi) potentially\nnegatively impacting our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate key personnel.\nWe may not realize\nthe anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and\nintegration of\nacquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nThere can be no assurances that any business combinations will have the\nimpact that we intend on our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nWhile we assess the potential benefits that could\nbe realized from any acquisition, as well as the potential costs and operating losses that\ncould be incurred, our assessments and\nestimates may differ materially from actual costs and benefits realized.\nIf we cannot effectively compete within the equipment leasing industry,\nwe may be\nunable to increase our revenues or maintain\nour current levels of\noperations.\nThe business of small-ticket equipment leasing is highly fragmented\nand competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger\nand have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources\nthan we do. For example, some competitors may have a\nlower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us.\nA lower cost of funds could enable a competitor to offer\nleases and loans with yields that are lower than those we use to price our leases and loans, potentially\nforcing us to decrease our yields\nor lose origination volume. In addition, certain of our\ncompetitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments,\nwhich\ncould allow them to establish more origination partner and small business customer\nrelationships and increase their market share. The\nbarriers to entry are relatively low with respect to our business and, therefore,\nnew competitors could enter the business of small-ticket\nequipment leasing at any time. The companies that typically provide\nfinancing for large-ticket or middle-market transactions\ncould\nbegin competing with us on small-ticket equipment leases. If this occurs,\nor we are unable to compete effectively with our\ncompetitors, we may be unable to sustain our operations at their current levels\nor generate revenue growth.\nDeteriorated economic or business conditions may lead to greater than anticipated\nlease or loan defaults and credit losses and\nlower origination volumes, which could substantially reduce our operating\nincome and limit our ability to obtain additional\nfinancing.\nFurthermore, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics\n(including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of\nwar or terrorism, or other external events could significantly impact\nour business\n.\nHistorically, the capital\nand credit markets have experienced periodic volatility and disruption.\nIn many cases, these markets have\nproduced downward pressure on stock prices of, and credit availability\nto, certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019\nunderlying financial strength. Concerns over geopolitical issues and\nthe availability and cost of credit, have contributed to increased\nvolatility for the economy and the capital and credit markets. In the event\nof extreme and prolonged market events, such as a global\ncredit crisis, we could incur significant losses.\nEven in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of\nloss\ndue to market volatility.\nOur operating income may be reduced by various economic factors\nand business conditions, including the level of economic activity\nin the markets in which we operate. In turn, those economic factors and business conditions\ncan be significantly and negatively\nimpacted by natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including\nthe recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of war or terrorism or\nother adverse external events, all of which can result in economic slowdowns\nor recessions. Delinquencies and credit losses generally\nincrease during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because we extend\ncredit primarily to small and mid-sized businesses, many of\nour customers may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions\nand may be unable to make scheduled lease or\nloan payments during these periods. Therefore, to the extent that economic\nactivity or business conditions deteriorate, our\ndelinquencies and credit losses may increase. Unfavorable economic\nconditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain\nboth our new lease and loan origination volume and the credit quality of new\nleases and loans at levels previously attained.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding\ncosts or operating cost structure or limit our access to funding. We\nexperienced such impacts in the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result\nof macroeconomic conditions driven by the COVID-19\npandemic, which would be the primary driver of negative impacts for\n2020 as compared to 2019, including $10.0 million increase in\nrealized credit losses, a 52% decline in equipment finance origination\nvolumes, a 69% decline in working capital origination volumes,\nas well as reduced capital market interest in purchases of finance contracts\nthat, paired with our lower origination volumes,\nsubstantially reduced our gains on sale.\nAny return to levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, or the timing of such\nreturn, remains\nuncertain, and any prolonged impacts could continue to impact our operating\nincome.\nIn addition, any further changes to economic\nand business conditions could reduce our operating income.\nIn addition, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including\nthe recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of war or terrorism or\nother adverse external events could have not only a significant economic impact\nas described above, but also a significant impact on\nour ability to conduct business as a result of business shutdowns, regional\nquarantines or otherwise.\nWhile we have established and\nregularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and\noperations.\nThe termination or interruption of, or a decrease in volume under,\nour property\ninsurance program would cause us to experience\nlower revenues and may result in a\nsignificant reduction in our net income.\nOur customers are required to obtain all-risk property insurance for the\nreplacement value of financed equipment. Each customer has\nthe option of either delivering a certificate of insurance listing us as loss payee\nunder a commercial property policy issued by a third-\nparty insurer or satisfying such insurance obligation through our\ninsurance program. Under our program, the customer pays for\ncoverage under a master property insurance policy written by a national\nthird-party insurer (our \u201cprimary insurer\u201d) with whom our\ncaptive insurance subsidiary,\nAssuranceOne, has entered into a 100% reinsurance arrangement. Termination\nor interruption of our\nprogram could occur for a variety of reasons, including: (1) adverse changes in laws or\nregulations affecting our primary insurer or\nAssuranceOne; (2) a change in the financial condition or financial strength\nratings of our primary insurer or AssuranceOne;\n(3) negative developments in the loss reserves or future loss experience of\nAssuranceOne, which render it uneconomical for us to\ncontinue the program; (4) termination or expiration of the reinsurance\nagreement with our primary insurer, coupled with an inability\nby us to identify quickly and negotiate an acceptable arrangement with a replacement\ncarrier; or (5) competitive factors in the property\ninsurance market. If there is a termination or interruption of this program\nor if fewer small business customers elected to satisfy their\ninsurance obligations through our program, we would experience lower\nrevenues and our net income may be reduced.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made\nby our management that could vary from actual\nresults.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing\nour financial statements, including but not limited to, when accounting for income\nrecognition, the allowance for credit losses, the\nresidual values of leased equipment, deferred initial direct costs and fees, late fee\nreceivables, the fair value of financial instruments,\nestimated losses from insurance program, and income taxes.\nIf the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are\nincorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization\nof value may be materially different than the amounts\nreflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular\ndate.\nSpecific to our allowance for credit losses, in connection with our financing\nactivities, we record an allowance to provide for estimated\nlosses based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including, among\nother things, past collection experience, lease and loan\ndelinquency data, industry data, economic conditions and our assessment of\ncollection risks. Significant management judgment is\nrequired to determine the appropriate level of the allowance and,\ntherefore, our determination of this allowance may prove to be\ninadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases and\nloans. Factors that could lead to the inadequacy of our\nallowance may include our inability to manage collections effectively,\nunanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete\nevents adversely affecting specific leasing customers,\nindustries or geographic areas. Losses in excess of our allowance for credit\nlosses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses, reducing\nor eliminating our operating income.\nOn January 1, 2020,\nthe Company adopted the guidance of\nASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) to measure its allowance for credit losses.\nThis standard substantially replaced the prior\nmeasurement that was based on probable, incurred losses.\nStarting in 2020, the recognized allowance estimate will include expected\ncredit losses over the remaining contractual term of the existing portfolio.\nAfter the adoption of this standard, our allowance estimate\nwill continue to involve management\u2019s\njudgment, and assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors,\nand such estimate\nwill still be subject to continual update driven by similar factors outlined\nabove.\nSpecific to our estimates of residual value of equipment, we record sales-type\nfinancing leases at the aggregate future minimum lease\npayments plus the estimated residual value less unearned income.\nResidual values are established on our balance sheet at lease\ninception based on our estimate of the expected fair value of the equipment\nat the end of the lease term.\nRealization of residual values\ndepends on numerous factors including: the general market conditions\nat the time of expiration of the lease; the customer\u2019s election to\nenter into a renewal period; the cost of comparable new equipment; the\nobsolescence of the leased equipment; any unusual or\nexcessive wear and tear on or damage to the equipment; the effect\nof any additional or amended government regulations; and the\nforeclosure by a secured party of our interest in a defaulted lease. Our failure\nto realize our recorded residual values would reduce the\nresidual value of equipment recorded as assets on our balance sheet and\nmay reduce our operating income.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and\nestimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see\n\u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n-Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\u201d, and see \u201cNote 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \u201d in our Financial Statements for further\ndiscussion of our accounting policies in this Form 10-K.\nTechnology\nWe are continually encountering\ntechnological change.\nIf we experience significant telecommunications or technology downtime,\nour\noperations would be disrupted and our ability to generate operating\nincome could be\nnegatively impacted.\nOur business depends in large part on our telecommunications\nand information management systems, and we are increasing our\nreliance on our technology platform as a result of our current digital initiative\nbusiness strategy. The temporary\nor permanent loss of\nour computer systems, telecommunications equipment or software systems,\nthrough casualty or operating malfunction, could disrupt\nour originations and operations and negatively impact our ability to secure\nnew business and to service our customers. This could lead\nto significant declines in our operating income.\nFurthermore, particularly given our digital strategy implemented and announced\nin 2020, we are constantly undergoing rapid\ntechnological change with frequent introductions of new technology\n-driven products and services. The effective use of technology\nincreases efficiency and enables us to better service clients and\nreduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to\naddress the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products\nand services that will satisfy client demands, as well as create\nadditional efficiencies within our operations.\nMany of our large competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in\ntechnological improvements. We\nmay not be able to effectively implement new technology\n-driven products and services quickly or be\nsuccessful in marketing these products and services to our clients. Failure\nto successfully keep pace with technological change\naffecting the financial services industry generally\nand our business strategy specifically could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection\nprograms, or those of our outsource service\nproviders, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential information\nof our customers and affiliates or confidential\npersonal information of personal guarantors of our loans and leases.\nAny such failure, including as a result of cyber-attacks\nagainst us or our outsource partners, non-compliance with our contractual or other\nlegal obligations regarding such information,\nor a violation of the Company's privacy and security policies with respect to such\ninformation, could adversely affect us\n.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our\nclients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard confidential\ninformation. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource\nservice providers to follow,\na comprehensive information\nsecurity program that we monitor and update as needed, security\nbreaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by\nindividuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information\nof our customers, employees or stakeholders which\ncould potentially compromise confidential information processed and\nstored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure.\nThe legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding\ninformation security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies\nthat collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by\ncyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or\npotential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer,\nstockholder, employee or our data by cybercrime\nor otherwise, non-\ncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such\ndata or a violation of our privacy and security policies with\nrespect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result\nin significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action\nagainst us. Increasingly,\nour products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security breaches\nin connection with the\ndelivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and\ncould be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nWe cannot be certain\nthat advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography\nor other\ndevelopments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting\nthe networks that access our products and services.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur common stock price is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially depending\non many factors, some of which are beyond our control\nand may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations\ncould cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in\nour shares of common stock. Those factors that could cause fluctuations\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice\nand\nvolume\nfluctuations\nin\nthe\noverall\nstock\nmarket\nfrom\ntime\nto\ntime;\n\u2022\ns\nignificant\nvolatility\nin\nthe\nmarket\nprice\nand\ntrading\nvolume\nof\nfinancial\nservices\ncompanies\nor\nin\nthe\ntrading\nvolume\nof\nour\ncommon stock in particular;\n\u2022\nactual\nor\nanticipated\nchanges\nin\nour\nearnings\nor\nfluctuations\nin\nour\noperating\nresults\nor\nin\nthe\nexpectations\nof\nmarket\nanalysts;\n\u2022\ninvestor\nperceptions\nof\nthe\nequipment\nleasing\nindustry\nin\ngeneral\nand\nthe\nCompany\nin\nparticular;\n\u2022\nthe\noperating\nand\nstock\nperformance\nof\ncomparable\ncompanies;\n\u2022\nlegislative\nand\nregulatory\nchanges\nwith\nrespect\nto\nthe\nfinancial\nor\nbanking\nindustries;\n\u2022\ngeneral\neconomic\nconditions\nand\ntrends\n,\nincluding\nbut\nnot\nlimited\nto\nthose\nresulting\nfrom\nthe\nCOVID\n-\npandemic;\n\u2022\nmajor\ncatastro\nphic\nevents;\n\u2022\nloss\nof\nexternal\nfunding\nsources;\n\u2022\nsales\nof\nlarge\nblocks\nof\nour\nstock\nor\nsales\nby\ninsiders;\nor\n\u2022\ndeparture\ns\nof\nkey\npersonnel.\nIt is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below\nthe expectations of financial market analysts and investors\nand, as a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may\ndecline.\nWe have historically returned\ncapital to shareholders through normal dividends, special dividends and\nshare repurchases.\nThere\ncan be no assurances that these forms of capital returns are the optimal\nuse of our capital or that they will continue into the future.\nDuring 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an updated share repurchase\nprogram under which we repurchased 264,470 shares of\nour common stock in the year ended December 31, 2020 and at December\n31, 2020 had $4.7 million remaining authorizations under\nthat 2019 repurchase program. We\nhave no obligation to repurchase shares under this authorization,\nand any share repurchase program\nmay be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAny such repurchases reduce our market capitalization and public\nfloat, which is the number of shares of our common stock that are\nowned by non-affiliated stockholders and available for\ntrading in the securities markets, which may reduce the volume of trading in\nour shares and result in reduced liquidity and volatility in our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may\ncontinue to be volatile which may affect your ability to\nsell our common stock at an advantageous price. For example, the closing\nmarket price of our common stock on the NASDAQ fluctuated between\n$6.02 per share and $22.01 per share during 2020 and may\ncontinue to fluctuate.\nMarket price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to factors both within\nand outside of our control,\nincluding our strategic actions, industry and regulatory matters or other\nmaterial public announcements, as well as a variety of\nadditional factors including, without limitation, those set forth under\nthese \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements.\"\nAny repurchases would utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other\nways, or to meet other potential demands, and may not\nprove to be the best use of our capital. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase\nany, or the full amount authorized\nunder any\nshare repurchase program, or that any past or future repurchases will have a positive\nimpact on our stock price.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock by our significant shareholders may\ndepress our stock price or impair our ability to raise funds\nin new share offerings.\nOur existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters\nrequiring shareholder\napproval and over our management.\nA small number of shareholders own a substantial amount of our Common\nStock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our top 5 largest\nshareholders beneficially own 55% of our common stock. The market\nprice of our common stock could be adversely affected as a\nresult of sales of a large number of our common stock shares in the market,\nor the perception that these sales could occur.\nThese sales,\nor the possibility that these sales might occur,\nalso might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the\nfuture at a time\nand at a price that we deem attractive.\nThese shareholders, if acting together,\nwould be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors\nand the vote on\ncertain corporate transactions, including mergers\nand other business combinations.\nThis concentrated ownership could limit other\nstockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nThis may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may\nnot\nconsider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of\nour Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock\ncould make a\nthird-party acquisition of us difficult.\nWe are a Pennsylvania\ncorporation. Anti-takeover provisions of Pennsylvania law could make\nit more difficult for a third party to\nacquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our\nshareholders. Our amended and restated articles of\nincorporation and our bylaws contain certain other provisions that would\nmake it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us,\nincluding a provision that our Board of Directors may issue preferred\nstock without shareholder approval.", "PERMNO": 89913, "SIC": 6172, "TIC": "MRLN"}
