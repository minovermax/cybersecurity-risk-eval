{"cik": "1023994", "company": "SG BLOCKS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months, and our ability to raise capital may be limited.\nOn December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $4,900,857 and $579,117, respectively. However, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported a net loss of $4,512,680 and $1,971,313, respectively, and used $1,242,107 and $1,865,905 of cash for operations, respectively. If we are not successful with our efforts to increase sales, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If there is a shortfall, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, among other steps, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations going forward.\nWe may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to meet any cash shortfalls. The type, timing and terms of any financing we may select will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that, if such funds are available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to secure additional financing, further reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders. If we incur additional debt, we will likely be subject to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and require us to encumber our assets. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures will be significantly limited. Any of the above limitations could force us to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and you could lose all of your investment in our common stock. These circumstances have, in the past, raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and continued cash losses may risk our status as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred net losses in prior periods, and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenues. We may incur operating losses in the future as we execute our growth strategy. We intend to make significant expenditures related to marketing, expansion of our website, hiring of additional personnel and development of our technology and infrastructure. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of the difficulties facing the construction industry as a whole, economic conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to sustain or increase profitability.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants may dilute the percentage ownership of the then-existing stockholders and may make it more difficult to raise additional equity capital.\nAs of February 20, 2018, there are outstanding options and warrants to purchase 938,392 and 86,250 shares of common stock, respectively. The exercise of such options and warrants would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our stock, and any sales in the public market of common stock underlying such securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided by such securities.\nWe are dependent on the services of key personnel, and the unexpected loss of their services may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends highly upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team, specifically the efforts of Paul Galvin, our Chief Executive Officer, Mahesh Shetty, our President and Chief Financial Officer, Stevan Armstrong, our Chief Technology Officer, and David Cross, our Vice President of Business Development. The Company has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin, Armstrong, Cross and Shetty. The employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin, Shetty and Armstrong each provide for two year terms. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate increased revenue will depend upon our ability to retain, and, if necessary, attract experienced management personnel.\nThe loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2017, approximately 80% of our revenue was generated from two customers. Although we have contractual relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on certain vendors to supply us with materials and products that, if we were unable to obtain, could adversely affect our business.\nWe have relationships with key materials vendors, and we rely on suppliers for our purchases of products from them. Any inability to obtain materials or services in the volumes required and at competitive prices from our major trading partners, the loss of any major trading partner or the discontinuation of vendor financing (if any) may seriously harm our business because we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or at all. Other factors, including reduced access to credit by our vendors resulting from economic conditions, may impair our vendors\u2019 ability to provide products in a timely manner or at competitive prices. We also rely on other vendors for critical services such as transportation, supply chain and professional services. Any negative impacts to our business or liquidity could adversely impact our ability to establish or maintain these relationships.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe depend on the availability and skill of subcontractors, their willingness to work with us, and their selection of suitable and quality building materials.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our building projects and, in many cases, to select and obtain raw materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, improper construction processes or defective materials may be used to finish construction of our building projects. We may need to spend money to remediate such problems when they are discovered. Defective products can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of buildings. Though subcontracts are written to protect us from substandard performance or materials, pervasive problems could adversely affect our business. The cost to us in complying with our warranty obligations in these cases may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, materials suppliers and insurers. Further, the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of subcontractors. Although we believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good, there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conduct our operations. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs and on a timely basis could limit our ability to construct and deliver buildings and could erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty protecting our proprietary manufacturing processes, which could affect our ability to compete.\nThe Company uses a proprietary manufacturing process that allows us to be code-compliant in our SG BlocksTM product. Such manufacturing process is unique to the construction industry and is important to ensure SGB\u2019s continued success, and we cannot assure you that our efforts to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective. If other companies replicate our methodology, SGB could lose its competitive advantage. In addition, we currently have one patent application pending for the system and method for conversion of intermodal shipping containers to universal building modules. Specifically, the present invention relates to pre-fabricated modular construction of a structure utilizing converted shipping containers. SGB has also submitted a United States patent application for a portable blast containment checkpoint device intended for use at public events. Any pending or future patent or trademark applications may not lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances. The Company also cannot be assured that the scope of any patents issued in the future will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. Others may develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nExpansion of our operations may strain resources, and our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results.\nIncreased orders for our Modules have placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our operational, financial, and managerial resources and personnel. In addition, execution of our growth strategy will require further substantial capital and effective planning. Significant rapid growth on top of our current operations could greatly strain our internal resources, leading to a lower quality of customer service, reporting problems, and delays, resulting in a loss of market share and other problems that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to grow could place an additional strain on our personnel, management systems, liquidity, and other resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our operations could be adversely affected, resulting in slower, no, or negative growth, critical shortages of cash, and a failure to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur clients may adjust, cancel or suspend the contracts in our backlog; as such, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. In addition, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.\nBacklog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts we have been awarded. We include in backlog only those contracts for which we have reasonable assurance that the customer can obtain the permits for construction and can fund the construction. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog totaled approximately $76.7 million. This includes two large contracts entered into during 2017, as described in more detail in \u201cNote 12-Construction Backlog\u201d of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We cannot provide assurance that our backlog will be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at our customer\u2019s discretion. In the event of a project cancellation, we generally would not have a contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. In addition, the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices.\nThe contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided and adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. Additionally, our performance of our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and, therefore, our future profitability. We can provide no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce revenues in the amounts currently estimated, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.\nOur liability for estimated warranties may be inadequate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the construction industry and can be costly. At this time, our third-party providers offer guarantees and warranties in accordance with industry standards that flow through to our clients. A large number of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe can be adversely affected by failures of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our associates (i.e., employees), officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there are instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business may engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. It is possible that our associates may become aware of these practices but do not take steps to prevent them. If we learn of practices relating to buildings constructed on our behalf that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we will move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible, and we will take disciplinary action with regard to our associates who were aware of the practices, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take, we may be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation may be injured.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the construction industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe construction industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many international, national and regional economic factors, including the availability of consumer and wholesale financing, seasonality of demand, consumer confidence, interest rates, income levels and general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions. As a result of the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results fluctuate, and we currently expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we have and may continue to experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the construction market. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our financial condition and operating results.\nCybersecurity risks related to the technology used in our operations and other business processes, as well as security breaches of company, customer, employee and vendor information, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store and report data and interact with customers, vendors and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions, including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the systems. Misuse of internal applications, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Delayed sales, slowed production or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales, business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe current Congress has and continues to make significant changes to fiscal and international trade policies that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent legislation has mandated substantial changes to various policies, including fiscal and international trade. We are unable to predict the impact, if any, of these proposed changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if we are unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had tax net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $13.1 million that will expire between 2018 and 2037. At December 31, 2017, we had a valuation allowance of $3.1 million, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carryforward periods that exist in certain states. If we are unable to use our net operating losses, we may be required to record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nReforms to the United States federal income tax regulations could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, United States federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law, substantially reforming the Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act includes changes to United States federal tax rates, including a decrease in corporate tax rates, which could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, among other significant changes. Among other things, the 2017 Tax Act also imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits. Some of these reforms could adversely affect our business, and we continue to evaluate the effect the 2017 Tax Act may have on us.\nIn addition, the new law eliminates the ability to carry back any future net operating losses and only allows for carryforwards, the utilization of which is limited to 80% of taxable income in a given carryforward year. This could affect the timing of our ability to utilize net operating losses in the future.\nRisks Relating to the Construction Sector\nOur customers may be dependent upon third-party financing, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if additional third-party financing for our customers does not become available.\nOur business and earnings depend substantially on our clients\u2019 ability to obtain financing for the development of their construction projects. The availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry, the departure of financial institutions from the industry, the financial institutions\u2019 lending practices, the strength of the domestic and international credit markets generally, governmental policies and other conditions, all of which are beyond our control. In light of the current economic climate, some of our projects may not be successful in obtaining additional funds in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for construction financing, has been greatly reduced, and lenders may require project developers to invest increased amounts of equity in a project in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Unfavorable changes in the availability and terms of financing in the industry will have a material adverse effect on certain privately financed projects.\nOur results of operations also depend on the ability of any potential privately financed customers to obtain loans for the purchase of new buildings. Over the past few years, lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards, which have reduced lending volumes. If this trend continues, it would negatively impact our sales, which depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing. In addition, where our potential customers must sell their existing buildings or real estate in order to develop new buildings, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent buyers of potential customers\u2019 existing buildings from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to make purchases from us. If our potential customers cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe construction industry is highly competitive, and such competition may increase the adverse effects of industry conditions.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment characterized by competition from numerous local, regional and national builders. We may compete for financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. A decline in construction starts could adversely affect demand for our buildings and our results of operations. Increased competition could require us to further increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices, which could negatively affect our profits.\nThere can be no assurance that our Modules or modular construction techniques will achieve market acceptance and grow; thus, the future of our business and the modular construction industry as a whole is uncertain.\nThere can be no assurance that we will achieve market acceptance for our Modules or that the modular construction market will grow. Our business may be disrupted by the introduction of new products and services and is subject to changing consumer preferences and industry trends, which may adversely affect our ability to plan for the future development and marketing of our products. Although Modules have particular applications in a wide variety of market segments, there is no assurance that we will be able to expand our relationship within such market segments or, even if we do, that general market acceptance for Modules will continue to increase.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our projects, increase our expenses or limit our building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nVarious domestic and international rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the construction industry. Governmental regulation affects construction activities, as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. These industries also have experienced an increase in state and local legislation in the United States and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. If governments in locations in which we operate take actions like the ones described, they could adversely affect our business by causing delays, increasing our costs or limiting our ability to operate in those areas. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed projects, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties. Failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to or affecting us, or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws affecting us, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe dangers inherent in our operations and the limits on insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability costs and materially interfere with the performance of our operations.\nWhile we believe our insurance coverage is adequate and in line with our industry\u2019s standards, all construction, including modular construction, involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and suspension of operations. The failure of such structures during and after installation can result in similar injuries and damages. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability. In addition, changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we and our competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur stock price will be subject to fluctuations, and will likely continue to be subject to fluctuations and decline, due to factors beyond our control, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock will be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Shares of our common stock were sold in our Public Offering in June 2017 at a price of $5.00 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf economic and market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the construction industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf industry developments;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf material litigation or government disputes;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u25cf the size of our market float and potential dilution due to the exercise of outstanding options and warrants;\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders; and\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nAs disclosed in our a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-215922), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 21, 2017 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d), our executive officers, directors and substantially all of our other stockholders prior to the Public Offering each agreed to lock-up restrictions, meaning that they and their permitted transferees were not permitted to sell any shares of our common stock for 180 days (and, in the case of our directors and officers, 365 days) after June 21, 2017. Such lock up restrictions expired on December 19, 2017, and such holders of our common stock may now sell their shares in the public market in the United States, subject to registration or reliance upon an exemption from United States registration, including, in the case of shares held by affiliates or control persons, compliance with the notice, manner-of-sale and volume restrictions of Rule 144.\nIn addition, shares subject to outstanding options under our SG Blocks, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cIncentive Plan\u201d) will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. Substantial sales of such shares, at that time, could depress the sale price of our common stock.\nSignificant sales of our common stock, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions in the future. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who, as of February 20, 2018, owned greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, beneficially own approximately 44.8% of our outstanding common stock (not including exercisable options). Accordingly, these stockholders will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with investors\u2019 interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change in control of us, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company or our assets and might affect the prevailing price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may negatively impact the price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nThe issuance of additional securities by our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d or \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and could discourage the acquisition of the Company.\nOur Board, without any action by our stockholders, is authorized to designate and issue additional classes or series of capital stock (including classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such classes or series. The issuance of any new class or series of capital stock would not only dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders but may also adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock. The rights of holders of preferred stock and other classes of common stock that may be issued may be superior to the rights of the holders of the existing class of common stock in terms of the payment of ordinary and liquidating dividends and voting rights.\nIn addition, the ability of the Board to designate and issue such shares could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer or takeover proposal regarding the Company and the issuance of additional shares having preferential rights could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock and render more difficult the removal of current management, even if such removal may be in the stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or our industry, or publish negative reports about our business or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our industry or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, change their opinion of the prospects for our company in a negative manner or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Such provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of the Company, including a transaction in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our stock.\nBecause we are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements and other Nasdaq rules, or we may risk delisting. Delisting could negatively affect the price of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a future financing or for you to sell your common stock.\nWe are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other Nasdaq rules, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price and certain other corporate governance requirements. In particular, we are required to maintain a minimum bid price for our listed common stock of $1.00 per share. If we do not meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading of these securities on other markets or exchanges, or on an OTC market. In such case, our stockholders\u2019 ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities. There can be no assurance that the offered securities, if delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service or the over-the-counter markets. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, would also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of the offered securities, decrease securities analysts\u2019 coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and if the price of our shares of common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock (meaning that our shares may be considered highly speculative and may trade infrequently, which can make them difficult to accurately price or sell). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.", "PERMNO": 16802, "SIC": 3440, "TIC": "SGBX"}
