{"cik": "931336", "company": "DEAN FOODS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on the trading price and may result in the cancellation and discharge of our securities, including our common stock. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will govern distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\nWe have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic financial alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic financial alternatives to restructure our indebtedness. These efforts led to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on November 12, 2019.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the restructuring instead of focusing on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection and operating as debtors-in-possession also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships, which may cause, among other things, our suppliers, vendors, counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us. Although we remain committed to providing safe, reliable operations and we believe that we have sufficient resources to do so, customers may lose confidence in our ability to provide them the level of service they expect, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nWe have received notice of the NYSE determining to commence proceedings to delist our common stock. Trading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished and existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests.\nAs a consequence of the Chapter 11 Cases, on November 12, 2019, the NYSE suspended trading in our common stock at the market opening and we received written notice from the NYSE that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock because we are no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D following the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions. The delisting became effective on November 27, 2019. Since November 13, 2019, our common stock has been quoted on the Pink Open Market maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \"DFODQ.\" We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on this market in the future. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished upon the Company\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 and that existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests. These recent developments could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell shares of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or complete the proposed sale of the Company pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or if current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we could be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by the Court (possibly subsequent to a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code). If confirmation by the Court does not occur, we could be forced to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nAs described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Developments since January 1, 2019 - Asset Sale,\u201d the debtors-in-possession are in the process of seeking the authorization of the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases to consummate a sale of the Bid Assets to a potential Bidder. There can be no assurance that we will receive any Bid(s) (or that any Bid(s) we do receive will be on terms favorable to us), or that we will be able to obtain approval and complete any proposed sale because there may be objections from our stakeholders, which could include a committee of unsecured creditors, other debt holders or our equity holders.\nThere can be no assurance that our current cash position and amounts of cash from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity requirements, and our current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms. Failure to secure any\nnecessary exit financing or additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nAny Chapter 11 plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or adverse market conditions persist or worsen, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny Chapter 11 plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial industry, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, net debt and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the realization of our assets and liquidation of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty, and our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nIf a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is ultimately confirmed by the Court, our capital structure will likely be significantly altered under such plan (whether or not following a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code). Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nWhile operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may seek a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code in conjunction with, or instead of, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. As described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Developments since January 1, 2019 - Asset Sale,\u201d the debtors-in-possession are in the process of seeking the authorization of the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases to consummate a sale of the Bid Assets to a potential Bidder. There can be no assurance that we will receive any Bid(s) (or that any Bid(s) we do receive will be on terms favorable to us), or that we will be able to obtain approval and complete any proposed sale because there may be objections from our stakeholders, which could include a committee of unsecured creditors, other debt holders or our equity holders. Any sales or disposals of assets and liquidations or settlements of liabilities may be for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the development of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and/or sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such sales, disposals, liquidations, settlements or charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by our DIP Credit Agreement, our Receivables Securitization Facility and other financing arrangements.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions on us. For example, the terms of our credit facilities, leases and other financing arrangements contain financial and other covenants that create limitations on our ability to borrow the full amount under our credit facilities, effect acquisitions or dispositions and incur\nadditional debt. The agreements will also require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants. Specifically, the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement require us to comply with covenants that are customary for debtors-in-possession facilities of this type, including, but not limited to specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, guarantee obligations, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, leases, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, voluntary payments of other indebtedness, investments, loans and advances, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback transactions and compliance with case milestones. The DIP Credit Agreement also requires compliance with a variance covenant that compares actual operating disbursements and receipts and capital expenditures to the budgeted amounts set forth in the DIP budgets delivered to the DIP Agent and DIP Lenders on or prior to the closing date and updated periodically thereafter pursuant to the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement, the Receivables Securitization Facility or our other financing arrangements.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Court provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from, among other things, substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims against the debtors-in-possession that arose prior to the Petition Date or before consummation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Subject to the terms of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and orders of the Bankruptcy Court, any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nBusiness, Competitive and Strategic Risks\nVolume softness in the dairy category, combined with our volume losses, has had a negative impact on our sales and profits.\nIndustry-wide volume softness across dairy product categories, particularly within fluid milk, continued throughout 2018 and 2019. Decreasing dairy category volume has increased the impact of declining margins on our business. Periods of declining volumes limit the cost and price increases that we can seek to recapture. We have experienced volume losses and declines from historical levels from some of our largest customers, which has negatively impacted our sales and profitability. This will continue to have a negative impact in the future if we are not able to reduce costs quickly enough to offset the lost volume and attract and retain a profitable customer and product mix. We expect volume softness to continue in the future.\nThe continuing shift from branded to private label products could continue to negatively impact our profit margin.\nWe are experiencing a continuing shift from branded to private label milk products. Retailers continue to aggressively price their private label milk to drive foot traffic, which has been increasing the price gap between branded and private label milk. We believe this negatively affects our branded product sales as customers trade down to private label products. This trend could be accelerated by the continued expansion of deep discount supermarket retailers, such as Aldi and Lidl, in the U.S. market. These factors have negatively impacted and could continue to impact our mix and margins, which could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend heavily on commodity prices and the availability of raw materials and other inputs. Our failure or inability to respond to high or fluctuating input prices could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend heavily on the cost and supply of raw materials and other inputs including conventional raw milk, butterfat, cream and other dairy commodities, many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. Cost increases in raw materials and other inputs have caused and could continue to cause our profitability to decrease significantly compared to prior periods, as we may be unwilling or unable to increase our prices or unable to achieve cost savings to offset the increased cost of these raw materials and other inputs.\nAlthough we generally pass through the cost of dairy commodities to our customers over time, we believe demand destruction can occur at certain price levels, and we may be unwilling or unable to pass through the cost of dairy commodities, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Dairy commodity prices can be affected by adverse weather conditions (including the impact of climate change) and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frost, fires, earthquakes and pestilence, which can lower crop and dairy yields and reduce supplies of these ingredients or increase their prices.\nOur profitability also depends on the cost and supply of non-dairy raw materials and other inputs, such as sweeteners, petroleum-based products, diesel fuel, resin and other non-dairy food ingredients.\nWe are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to our large DSD system consisting of refrigerated trucks and trailers that we own or lease. In some cases, we also use third-party carriers to deliver our products. Conditions that may affect logistics and freight costs include, among other things, the nationwide driver shortage, unemployment rates and competition for labor, federal regulations applicable to drivers/haulers, increased commodity costs, third-party capacity, carrier acceptance rates and other factors. Our profitability has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by increased logistics and freight costs.\nOur dairy and non-dairy raw materials are generally sourced from third parties, and we are not assured of continued supply, pricing or sufficient access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. Damage to our suppliers' manufacturing, transportation or distribution capabilities could impair our ability to make, transport, distribute or sell our products. Other events that adversely affect our suppliers and that are out of our control could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and other inputs that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we desire. Such events include adverse weather conditions (including climate change) or natural disasters, government action, or problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations, costs, production, insurance, reputation and international demand and supply characteristics.\nIf we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any increased costs for such raw materials and inputs, our business could be negatively affected. While we may enter into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers and may purchase over-the-counter contracts with our qualified banking partners or exchange-traded commodity futures contracts for raw materials, these arrangements do not eliminate the risk of negative impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations from commodity price changes.\nWe may not realize anticipated benefits from our enterprise-wide cost productivity plan, and we may not complete this plan within our projected time frames, either of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are executing an aggressive enterprise-wide cost productivity plan to significantly overhaul and reset our cost structure. We believe these cost savings measures are necessary to offset our volume deleverage and position our business for future success and growth. Our future success and earnings depend upon our ability to realize the benefit of our cost reduction activities and rationalization plans, particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity, volume pressures, and reduced profitability. Inflation, declining volumes and competitive pricing pressures have negated, and may continue to negate, some of the impact of our cost saving efforts. In addition, several factors could cause our cost productivity plan to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These include potential disruption of our operations and other aspects of our business and significant investments required to execute the plan. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and result in unintended employee attrition. Our cost productivity plan will require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work. In addition, certain of our cost reduction activities have led to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion or distribution costs. For example, in connection with our plant closures, our cost of distribution on a per gallon basis has increased as we have changed distribution routes and transported product into areas previously serviced by now closed plants. If we fail to properly anticipate and mitigate the ancillary cost increases related to our plant closures or other cost savings, we may not realize the benefits of our cost productivity plan.\nIn addition, we must execute our plans within our projected timelines in order to meet our financial projections and to remain competitive in the marketplace. We could encounter delays in executing our plans, which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost productivity plan or complete them within the targeted time frame, we may be unable to meet our financial projections, or realize the necessary cost savings to offset the anticipated impact from our volume deleverage and cost inflation. In addition, we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Depending on the extent of the decline in our financial results and our financial and cash flow projections, we may also incur additional tangible or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods.\nOur volume, sales and profits have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the outcome of competitive bidding.\nMany of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive and are investing in their own private label products, which has intensified the competitive environment in which we operate. As a result, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations which have materially reduced our sales volumes and profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend of competitive bidding to continue. In order to win business in such a competitive environment, we may have to replace existing or lost volume with lower margin business, which could also negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, this competitive environment may result in us serving an increasing number of small format customers, which may raise the costs of production and distribution and negatively impact the profitability of our business. If we are unable to structure our business to appropriately respond to the pricing demands of our customers, we may lose customers to other processors that are willing to sell product at a lower cost, which could negatively impact our volume, sales and profits.\nPrice concessions to retailers have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our operating margins and profitability.\nIn the past, retailers have at times required price concessions that have negatively impacted our margins, and continued pressures to make such price concessions could negatively impact our profitability in the future. If we are not able to lower our cost structure adequately in response to customer pricing demands, and if we are not able to attract and retain a profitable customer mix and a profitable product mix, our profitability could continue to be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely impacted by a changing customer and consumer landscape.\nMany of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated. This consolidation may continue. These consolidations have produced large, more sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength, who may seek lower prices or more favorable terms, and they have increased our dependence on key large-format retailers and discount supermarket retailers. In addition, some of these customers are vertically integrated and have re-dedicated key shelf-space that was formerly occupied by our branded products for their private label products. We are also facing downward pricing pressure from retailers, such as discount supermarket retailers, who sell their own private label products and proprietary brands. In addition to the competitive pressures from retail customers, we are facing increased competition from dairy cooperatives and other processors.\nNumerous brands and products compete for shelf-space and sales, with competition based primarily on price, service,\nquality and the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitor\u2019s products. Our products also face increased competition from plant-based milk alternatives. We compete with such alternatives for shelf-space and sales as well.\nThe highly competitive retail fluid milk and broader grocery industries are facing additional future uncertainties as a result of the rise of discount supermarket chains, online and delivery grocery offerings, meal kit services, and other mechanisms of food delivery. These developments may trigger significant changes in pricing competition, and the grocery industry, as well as consumer buying patterns, the effects and timing of which are currently unknown.\nHigher levels of price competition and higher resistance to price increases have had a significant impact on our business. If we are unable to respond to these customer dynamics and potential future changes in the customer landscape, our business or financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our business strategy depends upon our ability to build our brands.\nBuilding strong brands is a key component of our business strategy in order to expand sales and volumes and to respond to the changing customer landscape. With the launch of our national brands, DairyPure\u00ae and TruMoo\u00ae, we have expanded from a regional branding strategy to a national branding strategy. We may be unable to fund the advertising and marketing campaigns necessary to build brand awareness and preference over other brands or our private label products. We may not be successful in our efforts to expand our regional brand presence to a national brand presence, and we cannot guarantee that the advertising and marketing campaigns we are able to fund will result in customer or consumer acceptance of our brands. Further, the success of our national branding strategy requires us to drive operational changes in order to have a national brand footprint. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFurther, brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including future consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to produce consistently positive consumer experience or the products becoming unavailable to our consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers and others increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about Dean Foods, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands, reputation and brand loyalty, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.\nThe loss of, or a material reduction or change in the mix of sales volumes purchased by, any of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits.\nWalmart Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for approximately 15.3% and 15.3% of our consolidated net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and our top five customers, including Walmart, collectively accounted for approximately 42% and 29% of our consolidated net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with Walmart Inc.\u2019s dairy processing plant in Indiana, we lost approximately 55 million gallons of private label fluid milk volume beginning in the second half of 2018, which equates to approximately 125 million gallons annually. In addition, we expect marketplace volume and mix changes to continue in 2020, including those associated with our largest customer.\nWe are also indirectly exposed to the financial and business risks of our largest customers because, if their business declines, they may correspondingly decrease the volumes purchased from us. The loss of, or further declines or changes in the mix of sales volumes purchased by, any of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits, particularly due to our significant fixed costs and assets, which are difficult to rapidly reduce in response to significant volume declines.\nIf we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences, demand for our products could decline.\nConsumer tastes, preferences and consumption habits evolve over time and are difficult to predict. Demand for our products depends on our ability to identify and offer products that appeal to these shifting preferences. Factors that may affect consumer tastes and preferences include:\n\u2022\ndietary trends and increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sugar, fat, protein or calorie content of different foods and beverages;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, such as dairy, sugar and other sweeteners, vitamins and minerals;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people; and\n\u2022\nincreasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production.\nIf we fail to anticipate and respond to these changes and trends, we may experience reduced consumer demand for our products, which in turn could adversely affect our sales volumes and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur business operations could be disrupted and the liquidity and market price of our securities could decline if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or experience a security breach.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We maintain a large database of confidential information and sensitive data in our information technology systems, including confidential employee, supplier and customer information that may subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls, and accounting, financial and other data on which we rely for internal and external financial reporting and other purposes. We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, including those of third parties, to effectively manage and support our business processes and activities, including our business data, communications, supply chain, logistics, accounting and other business processes. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, manage and sustain an appropriate technology environment, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, as part of our current business strategy and the implementation of our enterprise-wide cost productivity plan to improve operations and cost structure, we are expanding and improving our information technologies, migrating certain systems to enterprise-wide systems solutions, and utilizing cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third parties. These initiatives have resulted in a larger technological presence and increased our exposure to cybersecurity risk, including risk that the data held by a third party could be breached or risk that a third-party service provider fails to perform effectively or that we fail to adequately monitor their performance, any of which may result in a negative impact to our business or financial results. Also, our ability to achieve anticipated enterprise-wide cost savings may be negatively impacted by our failure to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our Information technology and related initiatives or our failure to fully or successfully implement such initiatives.\nIn addition, our information technology systems and infrastructure and those of third parties may be vulnerable to damage, disruption or shutdown due to circumstances beyond our control, including attacks by hackers, social engineering attacks, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, and it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period. The misappropriation, theft, destruction, loss, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information, or interference with our information technology systems or those of our third-party providers could result in business disruption, negative publicity, damage to our brands and our reputation, negatively impact our relations with our customers or employees, and expose us to liability and litigation. Moreover, a security breach or the failure of our information technologies systems or those of our third party providers could also result in the alteration, corruption or loss of the accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for internal and external financial reporting and other purposes and, depending on the severity of the security breach or systems failure, could prevent the audit of our financial statements or our internal control over financial reporting from being completed on a timely basis or at all, or could negatively impact the resulting audit opinions. Any such damage or interruption, or alteration, corruption, or loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause our securities to become less liquid and the market price of our securities to decline.\nWe may incur liabilities or harm to our reputation, or be forced to recall products, as a result of real or perceived product quality or other product-related issues.\nWe sell products for human consumption, which involves a number of risks. Product contamination, spoilage, other adulteration, misbranding, mislabeling, or product tampering could require us to recall products. We also may be subject to liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including environmental, health and safety requirements, or in the event our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states, or laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant product liability, consumer fraud or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales, brands, reputation and profitability. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is found to be without merit or is otherwise unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation and brand image, particularly in categories that consumers believe as having strong health and wellness credentials. Further, the risks to our reputation and brand image are more susceptible on a national scale as a result of our expansion from a regional branded platform to a national branded platform. In addition, consumer preferences related to genetically modified foods, animal proteins, or the use of certain sweeteners could result in negative publicity and adversely affect our reputation. Any loss\nof consumer confidence in our product ingredients or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruption of our supply or distribution chains or transportation systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to make, move and sell our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather (including the impact of climate change), natural disaster, fire, environmental incident, terrorism (including eco-terrorism and bio-terrorism), pandemic, strikes, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors, warehousing and transportation providers, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. If we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain. In addition, we are subject to federal motor carrier regulations, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, with which our extensive DSD system must comply. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in our inability to deliver product to our customers in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our reputation and our results.\nFailure to maintain sufficient internal production capacity or to enter into co-packing agreements on terms that are beneficial for us may result in our inability to meet customer demand and/or increase our operating costs.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong production platform and we rely on internal production resources and third-party co-packers to fulfill our manufacturing needs. As part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts, we have closed or announced the closure of a number of our plants since late 2012. It is possible that we may need to increase our reliance on third parties to provide manufacturing and supply services, commonly referred to as \u201cco-packing\u201d agreements, for a number of our products. In particular, there is increasing consumer preference for certain sized extended shelf life (\u201cESL\u201d) products in certain categories and we do not currently have ESL manufacturing facilities. As such, we must rely on our co-packers to manufacture our ESL products. A failure by our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations may disrupt our supply of products and cause damage to the reputation of our brand. If we need to enter into additional co-packing agreements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find acceptable third-party providers or enter into agreements on satisfactory terms. Our inability to establish satisfactory co-packing arrangements could limit our ability to operate our business and could negatively affect our sales volumes and results of operations. If we cannot maintain sufficient production capacity, either internally or through third-party agreements, we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing costs may increase, which could negatively affect our business.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain and develop our leadership bench, or fail to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for current leadership positions, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur continued and future success depends partly upon our ability to hire, retain and develop our leadership bench. Effective succession planning is also a key factor in our long-term success. Any unplanned turnover or failure to develop or implement an adequate succession plan to backfill key leadership positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge or to facilitate smooth transitions with regard to key leadership positions, could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our results\nWe are subject to legislative or other actions relating to taxes that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The rules related to U.S. federal income taxation are consistently under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the U.S. Treasury Department. These reviews and legislative changes can lead to changes in the tax rules in jurisdictions in which we operate, including tax reform in the U.S. that was enacted in December 2017, which could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose a significant part of your investment.\nAs a consequence of the Chapter 11 Cases, on November 12, 2019. the NYSE suspended trading in our common stock at the market opening and we received written notice from the NYSE that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock because we are no longer suitable for listing pursuant to List Company Manual Section 802.01D following the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions. The delisting became effective on November 27, 2019. Since November 13, 2019, our common stock has been quoted on the Pink Open Market maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \"DFODQ.\" We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on this market in the future. In addition, the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described in this section and the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by analysts or our inability to meet those financial estimates;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts;\n\u2022\nactivism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors; and\n\u2022\nspeculation by the investment community regarding our business.\nIn the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits or shareholder activism. The filing of a lawsuit against us or shareholder activism targeted toward us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This volatility may increase the risk that our stockholders will suffer a loss on their investment or be unable to sell or otherwise liquidate their holdings of our common stock. In addition, we expect that our existing common stock will be extinguished upon our emergence from Chapter 11 and that existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests.\nCapital Markets and General Economic Risks\nFuture funding requirements, withdrawal liabilities and related charges associated with multiemployer plans in which we participate could have a material negative impact on our business.\nIn addition to our company-sponsored pension plans, we participate in certain multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that are administered jointly by labor unions representing certain of our employees and multiple employers like us that have employees participating in the plan. We make periodic contributions to these multiemployer pension plans in accordance with the provisions of negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Our required contributions to these plans could increase due to a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or any employer, but is likely to have important consequences. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. In the event that we decide to withdraw from participation in one of these multiemployer plans, we could be required to make additional lump-sum contributions to the relevant plan. These withdrawal liabilities may be significant and could materially adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nSome of the plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities, which could increase the amount of any potential withdrawal liability. This requires us to potentially make substantial withdrawal liability payments when we close a facility covered by one of these plans, which could hinder our ability to make otherwise appropriate management decisions to operate as efficiently as possible. In addition, under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act of 2014, special funding rules apply to multiemployer pension plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d \u201ccritical,\u201d or \"critical and declining\" status. Some of the plans in which we participate are in critical or critical and declining status, and we have been required to make additional contributions and may be subject to additional contributions in the future. We are subject to substantial withdrawal liability with respect to a number of multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. Our greatest potential withdrawal liability is related to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, which is in \u201ccritical and declining\u201d status and has been for a number of years based on that plan's annual Form 5500 filings, meaning it was less than 65% funded. The plan is currently projected to become insolvent in 2025. It is unclear what will happen to this plan in the future, and the effects and consequences of the plan\u2019s insolvency are currently unknown. Future funding requirements and related charges associated with multiemployer plans in which we participate could limit the strategic alternatives available to us or could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe costs of providing employee benefits have escalated, and liabilities under certain plans may be triggered due to our actions or the actions of others, which may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nWe sponsor various defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans, as well as contribute to various multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our employees. Changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans. This could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements of our plans. Pension and post-retirement costs also may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and annual periodic pension costs. Recent changes in federal laws require plan sponsors to eliminate, over defined time periods, the underfunded status of plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act rules and regulations. Certain of our defined benefit retirement plans are less than fully funded. Facility closings may trigger cash payments or previously unrecognized obligations under our defined benefit retirement plans, and the costs of such liabilities may be significant or may compromise our ability to close facilities or otherwise conduct cost reduction initiatives on time and within budget. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to potential changes in funding requirements, the costs of maintaining our pension plans are impacted by various factors including increases in healthcare costs and legislative changes.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of catastrophic events, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe dairy industry is sensitive to changes in international, national and local general economic conditions. Future economic decline or increased income disparity could have an adverse effect on consumer spending patterns. Increased levels of unemployment, increased consumer debt levels and other unfavorable economic factors could further adversely affect consumer demand for products we sell or distribute, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Consumers may not return to historical spending patterns following any future reduction in consumer spending.\nWe are also subject to the risk of disruption by earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, epidemics or pandemics and other events beyond our control and the control of the third parties on which we depend. Any of these catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors or customers, and could decrease demand for our products, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries in which we or our suppliers operate, including the United States. The effect of this outbreak could include disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to travel, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers or other vendors in our supply chain. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLitigation could expose us to significant liabilities and may have a material adverse impact on our reputation and business.\nScrutiny of the dairy industry has resulted, and may continue to result, in litigation against us. Such lawsuits are expensive to defend, divert management\u2019s attention and may result in significant judgments or settlements. In some cases, these awards would be trebled by statute and successful plaintiffs are entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Depending on its size, such a judgment or settlement could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and impair our ability to continue operations. We may not be able to pay such judgment or to post a bond for an appeal, given our financial condition and our available cash resources. In addition, depending on its size, failure to pay such a judgment or failure to post an appeal bond could cause us to breach certain provisions of our credit facilities. In either of these or other circumstances, we may seek a waiver of or amendment to the terms of our credit facilities, but we may not be able to obtain such a waiver or amendment. Failure to obtain such a waiver or amendment would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and could impair our ability to continue operations. Moreover, such litigation could expose us to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our brands, reputation and/or customer preference for our products.\nWe were previously a party to a private antitrust lawsuit brought by two plaintiffs that was scheduled for trial beginning March 28, 2017. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs agreed with us to settle the lawsuit. We agreed to pay settlements to the plaintiffs and the parties resolved all outstanding claims in the litigation and agreed to voluntarily dismiss the litigation. The litigation was dismissed on March 21, 2017 with respect to one plaintiff, and on March 26, 2017 with respect to the other plaintiff. The two plaintiffs initiated the case in 2007 as a putative class action. Although the court refused to certify the case as a class action, the court\u2019s denial of class certification did not act as an adjudication on the merits for the class of purchasers the named plaintiffs proposed to represent. Therefore, we may be subject to subsequent litigation by such purchasers.\nOn November 12, 2019, we filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization in the Bankruptcy Court. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if actual losses from legal claims against us exceed our reserves.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. If the amounts we are required to pay as a result of claims against us substantially exceed the sums anticipated by our reserves, if established, the need to pay those amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLabor disputes could adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 39% of our employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreements generally run in duration from 3 to 5 years. At any given time, we may face a number of union organizing drives. When we negotiate collective bargaining agreements or terms, we and the union may disagree on important issues which, in turn, could possibly lead to a strike, work slowdown or other job actions at one or more of our locations. In the event of a strike, work slowdown or other labor unrest, or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms, our ability to supply our products to customers could be impaired, which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims, and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities. In addition, our ability to make short-term\nadjustments to control compensation and benefits costs or otherwise to adapt to changing business requirements may be limited by the terms of our collective bargaining agreements.\nOur business is subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our compliance costs or subject us to liabilities.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous requirements in the United States relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, as well as similar state and local statutes and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants, the use of refrigerants, the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations may be significant, particularly relating to wastewater and ammonia treatment which are capital intensive. Additionally, we could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of the failure to comply with, or liabilities under, environmental, health and safety requirements. New legislation, as well as current federal and other state regulatory initiatives relating to these environmental matters, could require us to replace equipment, install additional pollution controls, purchase various emission allowances or curtail operations. These costs could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws, regulations and accounting standards could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the FDA, the USDA, U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), FTC, Department of Transportation, Department of Labor, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and numerous related regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in federal, state or local laws, or the interpretations of such laws and regulations, may negatively impact our financial results or our ability to market our products. Any or all of these risks could adversely impact our financial results.\nViolations of laws or regulations related to the food industry, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations related to the food industry, could adversely affect our business.\nThe food production and marketing industry is subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including food safety requirements related to the ingredients, manufacture, processing, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling quality and distribution of our products, as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities are subject to extensive regulation. We are regulated by, among other federal and state authorities, the FDA, the EPA, the FTC, and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Transportation. In December 2018 USDA issued its final rule under the 2016 National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, which requires companies of our size to have labels disclosing whether products contain or are derived from genetically engineered organisms as defined by the rule by January 2022. Change and implementation of new labels on our products to comply with this rule may result in significant costs to our business. In addition, a growing number of local ordinances across the country have imposed a tax on sweetened beverages, which may have a negative impact on our sales, results of operations and our business. In addition, a number of states and localities are expected to consider similar laws. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, immigration and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers.\nIn addition, our volumes may be impacted by the level of government spending that supports grocery purchases because such amounts may impact the level of consumer spending on fluid dairy products. As a meaningful portion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d) benefits are spent in the dairy category, we are cautious about the impact that any change or reduction in these benefits could have on consumer spending in the dairy category. Any reduction or change in SNAP benefits or the suspension, curtailment, or expiration of other government spending programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, could have an adverse impact upon our volumes and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the marketing and advertising of our products could make us the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal and state laws and regulations, and we may be subject to initiatives that limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs, increase other costs of doing business for us, our customers or our suppliers, or restrict our actions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes or procedures (or force us to implement new processes or procedures). For example, the FDA has finalized new regulations pursuant to the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 which requires, among other things, that food facilities conduct contamination hazard analysis, implement risk-based preventive controls and develop track-and-trace capabilities, and there could be unforeseen issues, requirements and costs that arise as we come into compliance with these new rules by the various required compliance dates, with the last new rule becoming\neffective in 2019. Further, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 83421, "SIC": 2020, "TIC": "DFODQ"}
