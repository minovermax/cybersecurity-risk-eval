RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could affect future results include the following:\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nFuture results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to continue revenue growth and margin expansion in its Services business.\nThe company\u2019s strategy places an emphasis on an industry go-to-market approach with a focus within the company\u2019s Services business on growing revenue, including specifically on higher value and higher margin offerings. The company\u2019s ability to grow revenue and profitability in this business will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in this business are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients\u2019 perception of the company\u2019s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company\u2019s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability resulting from lower margin offerings.\nThe company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans.\nThe company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2019, the company made cash contributions of $103.9 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2020 the company estimates that it will be required to make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $278.9 million, which are comprised of approximately $238.8 million for the company\u2019s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and approximately $40.1 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Although estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates, the company currently anticipates that its required cash contributions will remain significant for the next several years. Based on conditions as of December 31, 2019, the company anticipates that its required cash contributions for 2020 through 2024 will be approximately $1.2 billion in the aggregate. The company currently anticipates that it may need to obtain additional funding in order to make these contributions. There is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funding or that the company will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions.\nIf the proposed sale of the company\u2019s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company plans to use approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to fund the required cash contributions for 2020 through 2022. However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed. See \u201c--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business.\u201d\nThe company has also applied for waivers with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to defer a portion of the required contributions to its two U.S. qualified defined benefit pensions plan, which if granted would reduce total required cash contributions by approximately $115 milllion in calendar year 2020 and defer these payments over a five-year period. There is no specified time frame in which the IRS must make a decision. The IRS may choose not to grant the application, or to grant it for an amount less than the amount requested.\nDeterioration in the value of the company\u2019s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on the company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company\u2019s business and liquidity and may result in a default with respect to the company\u2019s pension obligations and under the company\u2019s debt agreements.\nMarket conditions may impact the company\u2019s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. Based on the most recent estimates for the required cash contributions to the company\u2019s worldwide defined benefit pension plans for the period from 2020 to 2024, the company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional financing in order to fund some or all of these contributions. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and the company\u2019s required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes\ndue. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to the company\u2019s pension obligation and under the company\u2019s debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact the company\u2019s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.\nIf the proposed sale of the company\u2019s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale to redeem its $440 million senior secured notes due 2022. See \u201c--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business.\u201d In the event that the Company seeks to raise additional funds in the future by accessing the financing markets, there can be no assurances that such future financings would be on similar or favorable terms as compared to the senior secured notes due 2022 or that the company would be able to access the financing markets at all.\nA reduction in the company\u2019s credit rating could adversely affect its business and/or the holders of its securities.\nThe credit rating agencies rating the company\u2019s indebtedness regularly evaluate the company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company\u2019s financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within the company\u2019s control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current credit ratings. A downgrade of the company\u2019s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase its cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the company or purchase its securities and impact the company\u2019s ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business. This could affect the company\u2019s growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nFuture results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new solutions.\nThe company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain existing clients in its Technology business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to renew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold as a Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on the company\u2019s short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact the company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth family of software, as well as in other software and solutions. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth products or other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth and other new solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.\nThe company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company\u2019s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company\u2019s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company\u2019s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company\u2019s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company\u2019s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. Future results will depend on the company\u2019s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins and on the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain talented people.\nCybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company\u2019s business and reputation.\nThe company\u2019s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company\u2019s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company\u2019s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of the security and reliability of the company\u2019s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nThe company\u2019s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry.\nThe company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company\u2019s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. The company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company\u2019s offerings less competitive.\nThe company\u2019s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients.\nThe company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services, including contracts with governmental entities as part of the rebid process. The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.\nThe company\u2019s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues.\nIn a number of the company\u2019s long-term services contracts, the company\u2019s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at the contract\u2019s inception are not guaranteed. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer\u2019s discretion before the end of the contract\u2019s term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.\nThe company\u2019s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. These contracts also contain provisions allowing the governmental entity to terminate the contract at the governmental entity\u2019s discretion before the end of the contract\u2019s term. In addition, if the company\u2019s performance is unacceptable to the customer under a government contract, the government retains the right to pursue remedies under the affected contract, which remedies could include termination.\nCertain of the company\u2019s services agreements require that the company\u2019s prices be benchmarked if the customer requests it and provide that those prices may be adjusted downward if the pricing for similar services in the market has changed. As a result, revenues anticipated at the beginning of the terms of these contracts may decline in the future.\nSome of the company\u2019s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company\u2019s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.\nA significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\nApproximately 47% of the company\u2019s total revenue is derived from international operations, and if the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is consummated, the portion of the company\u2019s total revenue derived from international operations will be approximately 63%. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.\nThe company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions.\nAs part of the company\u2019s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size and including the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions, such as the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business, include difficulty finding buyers or alternative\nexit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company\u2019s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of certain risks relating to the proposed sale of the company\u2019s U.S. Federal business, see \u201c--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.\nIf global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company\u2019s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company\u2019s business. If, as a result of such an event, such as the outbreak of the coronavirus known as Covid-19, the company\u2019s clients in a particular industry such as travel and transportation companies or financial institutions were to suffer material adverse impacts, the company may experience a reduction in demand for its services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of Brexit could adversely affect the company\u2019s operations in the United Kingdom as well as the funded status of the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans.\nThe impact of the decision by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, and the resulting effect on the political and economic future of the U.K. and the European Union is uncertain. Depending on the outcome, the company may decide to alter its European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result, which may adversely affect the company\u2019s financial results. In addition, uncertainty regarding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., the European Union or globally. As a result of these possible effects, among others, Brexit could adversely impact the company\u2019s operations in the U.K., cause increased volatility in the measurement of the pension assets or benefit obligations in the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans, as well as adversely affect the funded status of the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans.\nIf the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted.\nThe success of the company\u2019s business is dependent upon its ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute the company\u2019s business model and achieve its business objectives. The failure of the company to retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company\u2019s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel.\nA significant disruption in the company\u2019s IT systems could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and reputation.\nWe rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market\u2019s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nA U.S. Federal government shutdown may adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently, approximately 25% of the company\u2019s total consolidated revenue is derived from sales of commercial services and products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal government. The impact of a U.S. Federal government shutdown for a significant duration could result in the suspension of work on contracts in process or in payment delays which could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s revenue, profit and cash flows. If the proposed sale of the company\u2019s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company will no longer derive any revenue from direct sales of commercial services and products to the U.S. Federal government, though it is expected that the buyer of the U.S. Federal business will be a reseller of certain of the company\u2019s services and products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal government. However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed. See \u201c--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s contracts with U.S. governmental agencies may subject the company to audits, criminal penalties, sanctions and other expenses and fines.\nThe company frequently enters into contracts with governmental entities. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, contract terms and conditions, and its systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, billing, accounting, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be overcharged or improperly allocated to a specific contract or any amounts improperly billed or charged for products or services will be subject to reimbursement to the government. In addition, government contractors, such as the company, are required to disclose credible evidence of certain violations of law and contract overcharging to the federal government. If the company is found to have participated in improper or illegal activities, the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect the company\u2019s business or reputation. If the proposed sale of the company\u2019s U.S. Federal business is consummated, it is expected that all of the company\u2019s contracts with U.S. Federal governmental entities will be assigned to the buyer of that business after the sale. However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed. See \u201c--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business.\u201d\nThe company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products.\nThe success of the company\u2019s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company\u2019s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships.\nThe company maintains business relationships with suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company\u2019s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company\u2019s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.\nAn involuntary termination of the company\u2019s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans would adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the company had approximately $1.3 billion of underfunded pension obligations under its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate the company\u2019s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, the company\u2019s obligations with respect to such plans would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by the company to pay its pension plan insurance premiums with respect to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on the company\u2019s assets. Such an event would result in an event of default under the company\u2019s debt agreements and would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe company\u2019s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.\nLegal proceedings could affect the company\u2019s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company\u2019s business or reputation.\nThere are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. See Note 17, \u201cLitigation and contingencies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) (the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for more information on litigation. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the\nlegal matters pending against it. Additional legal proceedings may arise in the future with respect to the company\u2019s existing and legacy operations, and may adversely affect the company\u2019s business or reputation.\nOther factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.\nRisks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company\u2019s U.S. Federal Business\nThe company\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely impacted during the pendency of the sale of the U.S. Federal business, particularly if there is a delay in the completion of the sale.\nOn February 5, 2020, the company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell its U.S. Federal business, which provides certain products and services to federal government customers, to Science Applications International Corporation. The pending sale of the U.S. Federal business may cause disruptions to the company\u2019s business or business relationships, and may create uncertainty surrounding the company\u2019s ongoing business operations, which could materially and adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition, regardless of whether the sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, including as a result of the attention of company\u2019s management being directed to transaction-related considerations and being diverted from the day-to-day operations of the company\u2019s business, the uncertainty regarding the company\u2019s future which may adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel and other employees, and customers, suppliers or other parties with whom the company maintains business relationships experiencing uncertainty prior to the closing of the sale of the U.S. Federal business and seeking alternative relationships with third parties or seeking to terminate or renegotiated their relationships with the company.\nIn addition, with respect to the sale of the U.S. Federal business, the asset purchase agreement restricts the company from engaging in certain actions with respect to the U.S. Federal business without the consent of Science Applications International Corporation, which could prevent the company from pursuing business opportunities related to the U.S. Federal business that may arise prior to the consummation of the sale of the U.S. Federal business. Furthermore, the asset purchase agreement includes an indemnity by the company in favor of Science Applications International Corporation against losses incurred arising out of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants made by the company and liabilities expressly retained by the company.\nThe company has incurred, and will continue to incur, transaction costs in connection with the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed.\nIf the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, the company may not achieve the operational and financial results that it anticipates in the future.\nIf the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, the company\u2019s operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the U.S. Federal business from the company\u2019s other businesses. As a result, the company\u2019s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and the company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of its business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry. Moreover, the shares of the company\u2019s common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company than in existence today and the company\u2019s exposure to the risks inherent in its remaining businesses will increase. Additionally, the company\u2019s ability to return to the U.S. Federal business is restricted by the terms of the non-competition commitments made to Science Applications International Corporation pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale.\nWhile the company\u2019s cash flows will decrease after the proposed sale is consummated, the company will still have a substantial amount of outstanding pension obligations, even after the company applies a portion of the proceeds of the sale to reduce U.S. pension obligations. There is no certainty that the company will have the cash on hand to make the required cash contributions to the company\u2019s worldwide defined benefit pension plans in the future without additional funding.\nFollowing the closing of the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business, the company plans to use the net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and reduce U.S. pension obligations, which may not improve the company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows. Further, the anticipated benefits to the company of the proposed sale are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. Any such incorrect assumptions could adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit the company\u2019s ability to utilize net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset the gain from the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business.\nThe company has significant net operating losses and certain other tax attributes (collectively, NOLs) for federal income tax purposes that it expects to use to offset the gain from the sale of the U.S. Federal business. The company\u2019s ability to use its NOLs to offset the gain from the sale of the U.S. Federal business may be significantly limited if the company experiences an\n\u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of the company\u2019s ownership (by value) by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The limitation on the company\u2019s ability to utilize its NOLs arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend on the value of the company\u2019s equity at the time of any ownership change. If the company were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d, it is possible that the company would not be able to offset the taxable gain from the proposed sale, which is estimated to be approximately $1 billion.\nOn February 5, 2020, the company adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan to help protect the use of its NOLs. This plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.9 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.9 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of company stock. Despite the intentions of the plan to deter and prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d, such an event may still occur. In addition, the plan may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire the company, and may discourage open market purchases of company stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for company stock. Accordingly, the plan may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to realize a premium over the market price of company stock in connection with any stock transaction.\nThe price of the company\u2019s stock may be volatile during the pendency of the sale of the U.S. Federal business, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe trading price of the company\u2019s common stock may at times be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. In addition to other factors, these factors may include the timing and process for completion of the sale, including potential delays which may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the company\u2019s stock.\nThe occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the asset purchase agreement for the sale of the U.S. Federal business could adversely affect the company\u2019s future business.\nThere are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the pending sale of the company's U.S. Federal business. The occurrence of certain events, changes or any other circumstances could give rise to the termination of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale and cause the sale not to be completed. For instance, there is no assurance that the parties to the agreement will receive the necessary regulatory approvals required to close the transaction. If the parties fail to obtain such approvals or to meet other conditions necessary to complete the sale as set forth in the asset purchase agreement, the company may not be able to close the transaction and the company may not realize the anticipated benefits to its business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10890, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "UIS"}
