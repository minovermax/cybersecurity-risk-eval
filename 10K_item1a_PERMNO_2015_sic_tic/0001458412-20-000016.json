While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or share price in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Market\nA decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans and borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States, generally, and in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas in particular. If the U.S. economy weakens, or if the economies of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma or Texas weaken, our growth and profitability from our lending and deposit operations could be constrained. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to borrower repayment ability and collateral protection as well as reduced demand for the products and services we offer. In recent years, there has been a gradual improvement in the U.S. economy and the economies of the states in which we operate, as evidenced by a rebound in the housing market, lower unemployment and higher valuations in the equities markets; however, economic growth has been uneven, and opinions vary on the strength and direction of the economy. Uncertainties also have arisen regarding the potential for a reversal or renegotiation of international trade agreements and the impact such actions and other policies of the current administration may have on economic and market conditions. In addition, concerns about the performance of international economies can impact the economy and financial markets here in the United States. For example, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is disrupting global supply chains, which could adversely impact our customers and their customers, which in turn could impact their ability to make loan payments.\nIf the national, regional and local economies experience worsening economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment, our growth and profitability could be constrained.\nWeak economic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on commercial, mortgage and consumer loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines, and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are generally detrimental to our business. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and other regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and future tax rates are concerns for businesses, consumers and investors in the U.S. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Adverse economic conditions and governmental policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates generally, and we may be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments. Changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and deposits. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for loans and interest rates. Loan origination volume usually declines during periods of rising or high interest rates and increases during periods of declining or low interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans and other assets, on our balance sheet. Interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of any underlying property that serves as collateral for such loans may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest\nincome. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonaccrual loans would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nIf short-term interest rates remain at low levels for a prolonged period, and if longer term interest rates fall, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. This could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations. The ratio of variable- to fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio, the ratio of short-term (maturing at a given time within 12 months) to long-term loans, and the ratio of our demand, money market and savings deposits to certificates of deposit (and their time periods), are the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The composition of our rate sensitive assets or liabilities is subject to change and could result in a more unbalanced position that would cause market rate changes to have a greater impact on our earnings. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may adversely affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth at the rate we have enjoyed during the past several years. Our growth over the past several years has been driven primarily by new market expansion, a strong commercial and real estate lending market in our market areas and our ability to identify and attract high caliber experienced banking talent. A downturn in local economic market conditions, a failure to attract and retain high performing personnel, heightened competition from other financial services providers, and an inability to attract core funding and quality lending clients, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow as rapidly as we have in the past and as such may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may become more susceptible to risks associated with failing to maintain effective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as maintaining appropriate loan underwriting and credit monitoring procedures, maintaining an adequate allowance, controlling concentrations and complying with regulatory or accounting requirements, including increased loan losses, reduced earnings and potential regulatory penalties and restrictions on growth, all could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth and expansion through de novo branching.\nOur business strategy includes evaluating potential strategic opportunities to grow through de novo branching. As part of this strategy, we are in the process of opening of a second, smaller, full-service branch in the Dallas Metropolitan Statistical Area (\u2018\u2018MSA\u2019\u2019). De novo branching carries with it certain potential risks, including significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking location and successfully integrate and promote our corporate culture; poor market reception for de novo banking locations established in markets where we do not have a preexisting reputation; challenges posed by local economic conditions; challenges associated with securing attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth through de novo branching could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may grow through mergers or acquisitions, which may not be successful or, if successful, may produce risks in successfully integrating and managing the merged companies or acquisitions and may dilute our stockholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue mergers and acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial services companies within or outside our principal market areas. Although we occasionally identify and explore specific merger and acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices, we have no present agreements or commitments to merge with or acquire any financial institution or any other company, and we may not find suitable merger or acquisition opportunities in the future. We face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources or more liquid securities than we do, when considering merger and acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive merger and acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. If we fail to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, management, products and services, technologies, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target;\n\u2022\nnot realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses or incurring costs in excess of what we anticipated;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning clients of the target;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nassumption of nonperforming loans;\n\u2022\nthe price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u2022\nentering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key personnel and clients from either our business or the target\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain required regulatory approvals or satisfy conditions imposed by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities of the target;\n\u2022\nincurring costs in excess of what we anticipate; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nMergers and acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future and that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our common stock. We may also be required to sell banking locations as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions could impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nNew lines of business, services, products or product enhancements may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or acquire new lines of business or offer new services, products or product enhancements within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing, implementing and marketing new lines of business, services, products and product enhancements, we may invest significant time and resources. We may misjudge the level of resources or expertise appropriate to make new lines of business or products successful or to realize their expected benefits. We may not achieve target timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, services, products and product enhancements, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services.\nFurthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We introduced Enterprise Value Lending through our Kansas City market, Tribal Nations Lending through our Tulsa market and Home Builder Lending in our Dallas market. These products and services are relatively new and, if not managed effectively, could subject us to additional risks.\nUncertainty relating to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u2018\u2018LIBOR\u2019\u2019) calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of countries are conducting civil and criminal investigations into whether the banks that contribute to the British Bankers\u2019 Association (\u2018\u2018BBA\u2019\u2019) in connection with the calculation of LIBOR may have been under-reporting or otherwise manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR. A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to this alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the BBA, regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements, we may incur additional expenses in effecting the transition, and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with clients over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. At December 31, 2019, $1 billion of our loans were tied to LIBOR.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $742 million, $664 million and $704 million, respectively. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. These and other factors could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of our common stock. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our inability to accurately predict the future performance of an issuer or to efficiently respond to changing market conditions could result in a decline in the value of our investment securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could suffer material credit losses if we do not appropriately manage our credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. Changes in the economy can cause the assumptions that we made at origination to change and can cause borrowers to be unable to make payments on their loans, and significant changes in collateral values can cause us to be unable to collect the full value of loans we make. There is no assurance that our loan approval and credit risk monitoring procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit administration personnel and our policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry in each of our primary markets and across the United States. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, including sustained low oil or gas prices or the failure of oil or gas prices to rise in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to our direct exposure to energy loans, we also have indirect exposure to energy prices, as some of our non-energy clients\u2019 businesses are directly affected by volatility within the oil and gas industry and energy prices and otherwise are dependent on energy-related businesses. Prolonged or further pricing pressure on oil and gas could lead to increased credit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated with our energy portfolio, increased utilization of our contractual obligations to extend credit, and weaker demand for energy lending. Such a decline or general uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could have other adverse impacts, such as job losses in industries tied to energy, increased spending habits, lower borrowing needs, higher transaction deposit balances or a number of other effects that are difficult to isolate or quantify, particularly in markets with significant dependence on the energy industry, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate lending that could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow.\nAs a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the \u2018\u2018CRE Concentration Guidance\u2019\u2019) with respect to a financial institution\u2019s concentrations in CRE lending activities. This guidance was issued in response to the agencies\u2019 concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the CRE market. This guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant CRE loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit banks\u2019 CRE lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. The CRE Concentration Guidance identifies certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution\u2019s CRE concentration risk. The CRE Concentration Guidance is designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the CRE Concentration Guidance establishes the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (i) the institution\u2019s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total capital and reserves; or (ii) total CRE loans as defined in the guidance, or Regulatory CRE, represent 300% or more of the institution\u2019s total capital and reserves, and the institution\u2019s Regulatory CRE has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. Pursuant to the CRE Concentration Guidance, loans secured by owner occupied CRE are not included for purposes of the CRE concentration calculation. We believe that the CRE Concentration Guidance is applicable to us. The FDIC or other federal regulators could become concerned about our CRE loan concentrations, and they could limit our ability to grow by restricting their approvals for the establishment or acquisition of branches, or approvals of mergers or other acquisition opportunities, or by requiring us to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $3 billion of commercial purpose loans which include general commercial, energy and CRE loans, representing approximately 72% of our gross loan portfolio. Commercial purpose loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nAccordingly, a downturn in the real estate market or the general economy could heighten our risk related to commercial purpose loans, particularly CRE loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial purpose loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loan may be impaired. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial purpose loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial purpose loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAdverse developments affecting real estate values, particularly in the markets in which we operate, could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio (both commercial real estate and owner occupied). Real estate values may experience periods of fluctuation, and the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur largest loan relationships make up a significant percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 25 largest borrowing relationships ranged from approximately $34 million to $88 million (including unfunded commitments) and totaled approximately $1 billion in total commitments (representing, in the aggregate, 26% of our total outstanding commitments as of December 31, 2019). Our five largest borrowers, based on total commitments, accounted for 8% of total commitments as of December 31, 2019. Each of the loans associated with these relationships has been underwritten in accordance with our underwriting policies and limits. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this concentration of borrowers presents a risk that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be exposed to material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively affect our earnings and capital. Even if these loans are adequately collateralized, an increase in classified assets could harm our reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan.\nA portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of participation and syndicated transaction interests, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to monitor the lending relationships and lead to an increased risk of loss.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $99 million of purchased loan participations from other financial institutions and a combination of shared national credits and syndications purchased totaling $296 million. Although we historically have underwritten these loan participations and syndicated loans consistent with our general underwriting criteria, these loans may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate and administer. With respect to loan participations in which we are not the lead lender and in syndicated transactions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the agent bank, we rely in part on the lead lender or the agent, as the case may be, to monitor the performance of the loan. Moreover, our decision regarding the classification of such a loan and loan loss provisions associated with such a loan is made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender or agent bank. A lead lender or agent bank also may not monitor such a loan in the same manner as we would for loans that we originate and administer. If our underwriting or monitoring of these loans is not sufficient, our nonperforming loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.\nOur levels of nonperforming assets could increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings that are not performing in accordance with their modified terms) totaled $44 million and our nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned) totaled $48 million. However, we can give no assurance that our nonperforming assets will continue to remain at low levels and we may experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways and returns on assets and equity, and in addition, our loan administration costs increase, which together with reduced interest income adversely affects our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss.\nThese nonperforming assets also increase our risk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be distracting to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we were to experience increases in nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted as interest income is not recorded on our nonperforming assets and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which would have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as returns on assets and equity.\nOur allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses due to loan defaults and nonperformance on loans. We maintain an allowance in accordance with GAAP to provide for such defaults and other nonperformance. As of December 31, 2019, our allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.48% and our allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 128.54%. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our underwriting policies, adherence to credit monitoring processes and risk management systems and controls may not prevent unexpected losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance will adversely affect our earnings by decreasing our net income.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board decided to change how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred\nlosses, and investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new Current Expected Credit Losses (\u2018\u2018CECL\u2019\u2019) model that will become effective for us, as an EGC, for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Under the new CECL model, we will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses to whom we lend may have fewer resources to weather adverse business conditions, which may impair their ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business development and marketing strategies result in us serving the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete, and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small- to medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas or the specific markets in these states in which we operate and small- to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our senior management team and may have difficulty identifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel, which may divert resources and limit our ability to execute our business strategy and successfully grow our business.\nOur business plan includes, and is dependent upon, our hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated personnel at every level. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. The loss of senior management without qualified successors who can execute our strategy could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must successfully manage transition and replacement issues that may result from the departure or retirement of members of our management team. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incenting and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We need to continue to identify, attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. In addition, as a provider of relationship-based commercial banking services, we must identify, attract and retain qualified banking personnel to continue to grow our business. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or successfully address management succession issues, we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy and manage our growth. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on short-term funding, which can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $3 billion, or 68%, of our deposits consisted of demand, savings, money market, and transaction accounts (including negotiable order of withdrawal accounts). The approximately $1 billion remaining balance of deposits consisted of certificates of deposit, of which approximately $925 million, or 24% of our total deposits, was due to mature within one year. Based on our experience, we believe that our savings, money market and noninterest-bearing accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. Historically, a majority of nonbrokered certificates of deposit are renewed upon maturity as long as we pay competitive interest rates. Many of these clients are, however, interest rate conscious and may be willing to move funds into higher-yielding investment alternatives. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressure to increase the rates we pay on deposits. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur largest deposit relationships currently make up a significant percentage of our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits by our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.\nAt December 31, 2019, our 30 largest depositors accounted for 25% of our total deposits and our five largest depositors accounted for 11% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related client groups could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of withdrawals of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Additionally, such circumstances could require us to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnder applicable regulations, if the Bank were no longer \u2018\u2018well-capitalized,\u2019\u2019 the Bank would not be able to accept brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC and would be subject to a deposit rate cap, pursuant to which the Bank would be prohibited from paying in excess of 75 basis points above published national deposit rates unless the FDIC determined that the Bank\u2019s local market rate was above the national rate. The imposition of a deposit rate cap may require the Bank to reduce its deposit rates, which would likely cause the loss of depositors.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and failure to maintain sufficient liquidity could materially adversely affect our growth, business, profitability and financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse conditions or consequences. We require sufficient liquidity to fund asset growth, meet client loan requests, client deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. Liquidity risk can increase due to a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source of funding or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters. We have a concentration of large depositors which increases our liquidity risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary funding source is client deposits. In addition, the Bank has historically had access to advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, discount window and other wholesale sources, such as internet-sourced deposits and brokered deposits to fund operations. The Bank also acquires brokered deposits, internet subscription certificates of deposit, and reciprocal deposits through the Promontory Interfinancial Network (\u2018\u2018Promontory\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the Promontory network\u2019\u2019). The reciprocal deposits include both the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service and Insured Cash Sweep program. The Bank is a member of the Promontory network which effectively allows depositors to receive FDIC insurance on amounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently $250 thousand. Promontory allows institutions to break large deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other Promontory institutions to ensure full FDIC insurance is gained on the entire deposit. Although the Bank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us. The Bank\u2019s ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by the Bank\u2019s financial condition or regulatory restrictions, or impaired by\nfactors that are not specific to it, such as FDIC insurance changes, disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry. Borrowing capacity from the FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the condition of the Bank or the acceptability and risk rating of loan and securities collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at the lender\u2019s discretion.\nThe FRB or FHLB could restrict or limit the Bank\u2019s access to secured borrowings. Correspondent banks can withdraw unsecured lines of credit or require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds. Liquidity also may be affected by the Bank\u2019s unfunded commitments to extend credit. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nOur historical growth rate and performance may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results and our ability to continue to grow is dependent upon our ability to effectively manage the increases in scale of our operations.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or grow our business at all. We have benefited from the recent low interest rate environment, which has provided us with better net interest margins which we use to grow our business. Higher rates may compress our margins and may impact our ability to grow. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain historical levels of expenses. As a public company, we expect that we will incur additional expenses, commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support growth. Consequently, our historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of our future operations.\nWe have historically experienced rapid growth and our continuing business strategy focuses upon continuing such rapid growth. Our ability to succeed in this environment of rapid growth is dependent upon our ability to scale our operations, including various internal processes.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth.We may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our required regulatory capital levels. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital, and we would have to compete with those institutions for investors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition from banks, credit unions and other financial services providers that offer banking services, which may limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients.\nCompetition in the banking industry generally, and in our primary markets specifically, is intense. Competitors include banks as well as other financial services providers, such as savings and loan institutions, brokerage firms, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include larger national and regional financial institutions whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and ATMs, achieve larger economies of scale, offer a wider array of banking services, make larger investments in technologies needed to attract and retain clients, and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services as quickly as our larger competitors, our business may be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, we may be disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. Banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank\nregulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of a broader client base than us. Larger competitors may also be able to offer better lending and deposit rates to clients, and could increase their competition as we become a public company and our growth becomes more visible. If our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance. Moreover, larger competitors may not be as vulnerable as us to downturns in the local economy and real estate markets since they often have a broader geographic area and their loan portfolio is often more diversified.\nWe face growing competition from so-called \u2018\u2018online businesses\u2019\u2019 with few or no physical locations, including financial technology companies, online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment service providers. New technology and other changes are allowing parties to effectuate financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u2018\u2018disintermediation,\u2019\u2019 could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and access to lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also compete against community banks, credit unions and nonbank financial services companies that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small- to medium-sized businesses that we target. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Ultimately, we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nMany of our clients also hold equity interests in us and to the extent such clients determine to cease their ownership relationship with us, they may also decide to limit or terminate their client relationship with us.\nMany of our clients also hold equity interests in us. To the extent such clients determine to cease their equity ownership relationship with us, they may also decide to limit or terminate their client relationship with us. Our client relationships may decrease if our clients reduce their ownership positions.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to us, and we may incur losses due to ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, reputation, business, and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe are required to make significant judgments, assumptions and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and our judgments, assumptions and estimates may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \u2018\u2018Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u2019\u2019 describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u2018\u2018critical\u2019\u2019 because they require judgments, assumptions, and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or regulatory views concerning such analysis differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions, and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, in each case resulting in our need to revise or restate prior period financial statements, cause damage to our reputation and the price of our common stock and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we could be subject to regulatory penalties and the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies.\nIn particular, we will be required to certify our compliance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning with our next annual report on Form 10-K, which will require us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, unless we remain an EGC and elect additional transitional relief available to EGCs, our independent registered public accounting firm may be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning as of that annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe will continue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our internal control systems, including our financial reporting controls. Our actions, however, may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment, and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our access to the capital markets, cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nAdvances and changes in technology could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. We face many challenges, including the increased demand for providing clients access to their accounts and the systems to perform banking transactions electronically. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet these demands.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively or timely implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nFailure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete effectively and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risks and potential security breaches associated with our internet-based systems and online commerce security, and therefore we may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents and we may experience harm to our reputation and liability exposure from security breaches.\nWe conduct a portion of our business over the Internet. We rely heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing, software, communications and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business. In addition, our business involves the storage and transmission of clients\u2019 proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, litigation and potential liability.\nIn recent periods, several governmental agencies and large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients or other third parties, and subjecting those agencies and corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their clients and other third parties to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their credit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients for any resulting losses they may incur and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems. Additionally, we provide international wire transfer and other international services, which subject us to associated risks, including risks of increased difficulties recovering transferred funds in the event of fraud or otherwise.\nThird-party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events; furthermore, we could be subjected to an unauthorized takeover of one or more of our corporate accounts and subjected to unauthorized transfers. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our client information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our client confidential information at risk.\nWe have been the target of data and cyber security attacks and may experience attacks in the future. While we have not experienced a material cyber-incident or security breach that has been successful in compromising our data or systems to date, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. Although we monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of known cyber-threats and devote significant resources to maintain, regularly update and backup our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate, or effectively implement preventative measures against, all cyber attacks.\nA breach in the security of any of our information systems, or other cyber-incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain clients and our reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection or related to remediation. Furthermore, our clients could incorrectly blame us and terminate their account with us for a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on client, counterparty and third-party information, which subjects us to risks if that information is not accurate or is incomplete.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. While we have a practice of seeking to independently verify some of the client information that we use in deciding whether to extend credit or to agree to a loan modification, including employment, assets, income and credit score, not all client information is independently verified, and if any of the information that is independently verified (or any other information considered in the loan review process) is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. We may not detect all misrepresented information in our approval process. Any such misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operating risks related to employee error and client, employee and third party misconduct, which could harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error or employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee error or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon processing systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Employee error or misconduct could also subject us to financial claims. If our internal control systems fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFraudulent activity could damage our reputation, disrupt our businesses, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, clients and other third parties targeting us and our clients or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering, and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud. In addition, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures in order to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate fraudulent activity. Although we have not experienced any material business or reputational harm as a result of fraudulent activities in the past, the occurrence of fraudulent activity could damage our reputation, disrupt our business, increase our costs and cause losses in the future.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend, to a significant extent, on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other internet systems, loan and deposit processing, and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace our service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe follow a relationship-based operating model and negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and adversely affect our results of operations. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm.\nWe may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or services or design around our intellectual property, and in such cases we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential or proprietary information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how, which could be time-consuming and expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful.\nThe loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain rights with respect to third party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our products and services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities or failure to comply with regulatory requirements with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These properties may also be subject to various other federal, state or local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will involve significant expenditures.\nIf we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs or fail to comply with regulatory requirements with respect to these properties, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in proceedings or litigation. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. The ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nFinancial counterparties expose the Company to risks.\nWe maintain correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities transactions and engage in other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to our industry. Many of these transactions expose us to counterparty credit, liquidity and/or reputational risk in the event of default by the counterparty, or negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, about one or more financial counterparties, or the financial services industry in general. Although we seek to manage these risks through internal controls and procedures, we may experience loss or interruption of business, damage to our reputation, or incur additional costs or liabilities as a result of unforeseen events with these counterparties. Any financial cost, liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, including tornadoes, droughts, hailstorms and other natural disasters, pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. Operations in our markets could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities. While we have not experienced such an event to date, other severe weather or natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which increases the cost and expense of compliance and could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our earnings and ability to grow.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including, with respect to the Bank, the FDIC and the OSBCK and, with respect to the Company, the Federal Reserve. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, clients and the DIF, rather than for the benefit of stockholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, dividend payments and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Following examinations, we may be required, among other things, to change our asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict our operations, as well as increase our capital levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank\u2019s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations. Proposed legislative and regulatory actions, including changes to financial regulation, may not occur on the time frame that is expected, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients.\nCurrent and past economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the review of existing financial regulations. The Trump administration has also indicated in public statements that the Dodd-Frank Act will be under scrutiny and that some of its provisions and the rules promulgated thereunder may be revised, repealed or amended. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, including laws applicable to the financial industry and federal and state taxation, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business, financial condition and results of operations, may not occur on the timeframe that is proposed, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u2018\u20182017 Tax Act\u2019\u2019), enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, may\nimpact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. The 2017 Tax Act could negatively impact our customers because it lowers the existing caps on mortgage interest deductions and limits the state and local tax deductions. These changes could make it more difficult for borrowers to make their loan payments, and could also negatively impact the housing market, which could adversely affect our business and loan growth.\nMany of our new activities and growth plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal and state regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal and state banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the \u2018\u2018source of strength\u2019\u2019 doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, even if the Company would not ordinarily do so and even if such contribution is to its detriment or the detriment of its stockholders. The Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank.\nMoreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the bank holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its indebtedness. Thus, any borrowing that must be incurred by the Company in order to make a required capital injection to the Bank becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u2018\u2018FIRREA\u2019\u2019) grants the FDIC broad authority to charge off any losses caused by a failing bank subsidiary to the capital of a non-failing affiliated bank. Moreover, any bank operating under the Company\u2019s common control could be required by the FDIC to contribute capital to a failing affiliate bank within the Company\u2019s control group. This is known as FIRREA\u2019s \u2018\u2018cross-guarantee\u2019\u2019 provision. The Company currently has one bank subsidiary.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as calculated under these regulations.\nIn order to be a \u2018\u2018well-capitalized\u2019\u2019 depository institution under prompt corrective action standards (but without taking into account the capital conservation buffer requirement described below), a bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more (and is not subject to any order or written directive specifying any higher capital ratio). The failure to meet the established capital requirements under the prompt corrective action framework could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance. FDIC\ndeposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank. In addition, an inability to meet the capital requirements under the Basel III would prevent us from being able to pay certain discretionary bonuses to our executive officers and dividends to our stockholders. Due to the completed phase-in of a capital conservation buffer requirement, the Company and the Bank must effectively maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% or more, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% or more and, for the Bank, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more and for the Company, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more. Many factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital and other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets in the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments and other factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios.\nOur failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect client and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and our ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted. If we were restricted in the amount of interest that we could pay on our deposits, we could fail to maintain levels of deposits consistent with our business plan.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Although we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, either a deterioration in our risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBank regulatory agencies periodically examine our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur regulators periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. Accommodating such examinations may require management to reallocate resources, which would otherwise be used in the day-to-day operation of other aspects of our business. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were, or our management was, in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u2018\u2018unsafe or unsound\u2019\u2019 practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties against us, our officers or directors, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policy and other economic factors could affect our profitability adversely.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other AML requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u2018\u2018DOJ\u2019\u2019), the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC, which involve sanctions for dealing with certain persons or countries. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, or if the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Although, as of the date of this prospectus, we have not been subject to any fines or penalties, and we believe we have not suffered any material business or reputational harm, as a result of violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to such fines, penalties or losses or harm in the future.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our clients with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to \u2018\u2018opt out\u2019\u2019 of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of client information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators, states and foreign countries have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States and other countries are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of client or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face increased risk under the terms of the CRA as we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets.\nUnder the terms of the CRA, each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank\u2019s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory agency rates such bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA as \u2018\u2018Outstanding,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Satisfactory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Needs to Improve\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Substantial Noncompliance.\u2019\u2019 The Bank had a CRA rating of \u2018\u2018Satisfactory\u2019\u2019 as of its most recent CRA assessment. The regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of an institution\u2019s record is part of the regulatory agency\u2019s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office. As we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets, we will be required to maintain an acceptable CRA rating, which may be difficult.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions related to interstate banking and branching, including restrictions on interstate deposits.\nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the \u2018\u2018Interstate Act\u2019\u2019), together with the Dodd-Frank Act, relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches. As discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bank operates branches in Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, in addition to its home state of Kansas. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production, and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition, the purpose of which is to ensure that interstate branches do not take deposits from a community without the bank reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community.\nThe prohibition on establishing interstate branches for the purpose of deposit production, and the corresponding regulatory loan-to-deposit restrictions, could limit our ability to establish branches outside Kansas. We believe that the Bank\u2019s operations in Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas are in compliance with the Interstate Act and that the Bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank\u2019s branches in such states. If, however, the FDIC were to determine that the Bank is not reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank\u2019s branches in such states or the Bank otherwise fails to satisfy the requirements of the Interstate Act, then the FDIC could require the Bank\u2019s branches to be closed in such states or not permit the Bank to open new branches in such states.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u2018\u2018ECOA\u2019\u2019) and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The DOJ, the CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity, restrictions on expansion activity and restrictions on entering new business lines, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liability for potential violations of predatory lending laws, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nVarious U.S. federal, state and local laws have been enacted that are designed to discourage predatory lending practices. The U.S. Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in mortgages that have interest rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than those in the U.S. Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (\u2018\u2018HOEPA.\u2019\u2019) In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain mortgages, including loans that are not classified as \u2018\u2018high-cost\u2019\u2019 loans under applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefit test with respect to the related borrower. Such tests may be highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, a court may determine that a home mortgage, for example, does not meet the test even if the related originator reasonably believed that the test was satisfied. If any of our mortgages are found to have been originated in violation of predatory or abusive lending laws, we could incur losses, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nRegulatory agencies and consumer advocacy groups have asserted claims that the practices of lenders and loan servicers result in a disparate impact on protected classes.\nAnti-discrimination statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act and the ECOA, prohibit creditors from discriminating against loan applicants and borrowers based on certain characteristics, such as race, religion and national origin. Various federal regulatory agencies and departments, including the DOJ and the CFPB, have taken the position that these laws apply not only to intentional discrimination, but also to neutral practices that have a disparate impact on a group that shares a characteristic that a creditor may not consider in making credit decisions protected classes (i.e., creditor or servicing practices that have a disproportionate negative effect on a protected class of individuals).\nThese regulatory agencies, as well as consumer advocacy groups and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, have focused greater attention on \u2018\u2018disparate impact\u2019\u2019 claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed that the \u2018\u2018disparate impact\u2019\u2019 theory applies to cases brought under the Fair Housing Act, while emphasizing that a causal relationship must be shown between a specific policy of the defendant\nand a discriminatory result that is not justified by a legitimate objective of the defendant. Although it is still unclear whether the theory applies under ECOA, regulatory agencies and private plaintiffs may continue to apply it to both the Fair Housing Act and ECOA in the context of mortgage lending and servicing. To the extent that the \u2018\u2018disparate impact\u2019\u2019 theory continues to apply, we are faced with significant administrative burdens in attempting to comply and potential liability for failures to comply.\nIn addition to reputational harm, violations of the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act can result in actual damages, punitive damages, injunctive or equitable relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, and civil money penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock could fluctuate.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nconditions in the banking industry such as credit quality and monetary policies;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and be a distraction to management.\nKansas law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect, and there are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nKansas corporate law and provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our stockholders. Furthermore, with certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our Company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. Collectively, provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and other statutory and regulatory provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. Moreover, the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits certain business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of stock, up to the 200,000,000 shares of voting common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized in our articles of incorporation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to issue additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into shares of our common stock, for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the power to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, preferences over our voting common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. If declared, dividends will be payable to the holders of shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis in accordance with their shares held. If preferred shares are issued, such shares may be entitled to priority over the common shares as to dividends. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common stockholders. Other than the stock dividend provided to our stockholders pursuant to our recent two-for-one stock split, we have no history of paying dividends to holders of our common stock.\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization\u2019s overall asset quality, current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The Federal Reserve is authorized to determine under certain circumstances related to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. If required payments on our debt obligations are not made, or dividends on any preferred stock we may issue are not paid, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other than further issuances of securities, is distributions from our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe are a bank holding company with no material activities other than activities incidental to holding the common stock of the Bank. Our principal source of funds to pay distributions on our common stock and service any of our obligations, other than further issuances of securities, would be dividends received from our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Furthermore, our wholly-owned subsidiaries are not obligated to pay dividends to us, and any dividends paid to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and various business considerations. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates and economic conditions in general. In addition, various federal and state statutes limit the amount of dividends that our wholly-owned subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval.", "PERMNO": 18895, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFB"}
