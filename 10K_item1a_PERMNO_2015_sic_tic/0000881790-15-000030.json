{"cik": "881790", "company": "HF FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The risks we have highlighted below are not the only ones we face. If any of these events actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow could be negatively affected. We caution you to keep in mind these risk factors and to refrain from attributing undue certainty to any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nDifficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry.\nFrom December 2007 to June 2009, the United States experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. This period was marked by reduced business activity across a wide range of industries and regions, significant increases in unemployment, volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, and dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, which negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions across the United States. The recession was also marked by tightening of the credit markets and steep declines in the stock markets, which resulted in a difficult loan environment and decreased the value of our portfolio of investment securities.\nAlthough the domestic economy continued its modest recovery, there can be no assurance that the economy will not enter into another recession, whether in the near or long term. In addition, if the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, fails to continue to improve, this may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. A worsening of these conditions likely would exacerbate the adverse effects on us and others in the financial services industry noted above. Additional market developments such as a worsening of economic conditions in Europe or Asia would likely exacerbate the lingering effects of the difficult market conditions experienced by us and others in the financial services industry and could further slow, stall or reverse the recovery in the U.S.\nIncreased regulation of our industry continues to increase our regulatory compliance costs, impact our sources of revenue, and create regulatory uncertainty.\nImplementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives taken by Congress and the federal banking regulators has changed and will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of banking institutions and their holding companies, which is expected to continue to significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs.\nOur regulators continue to propose rules and implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish consolidated risk-based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies issued a final rule revising regulatory capital rules applicable to all insured depository institutions and their holding companies (except for certain savings and loan holding companies engaged in commercial activities). The new rule implements higher minimum capital requirements, includes a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and establishes criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. The new minimum capital to risk-weighted assets requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, which is an increase from 4.0%, and a total capital ratio that remains at 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015. As a result, the Company became subject to consolidated capital requirements which we had not been subject to previously. Further, the Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. See \u201cRegulation-Capital Adequacy\u201d and \u201cRegulation-New Capital Rules\u201d under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for further discussion about capital requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a new government agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions like the Bank, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. In early 2013, the CFPB issued eight final rules concerning the regulation of mortgage markets in the U.S. pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules amend several existing regulations, including Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act), and B (Home Mortgage Disclosure). See \u201cRegulation-Consumer Financial Protection\u201d under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for more detail about the consumer protection laws and their impact on us.\nMany other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act still require extensive rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by regulatory agencies. Accordingly, in many respects, the ultimate impact of the legislation and its effects on the U.S. financial system and the Company remain uncertain. We are continuing to closely monitor and evaluate regulatory developments. Such developments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations through significant increases in our regulatory compliance costs.\nDetermination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires significant estimates, and actual losses may vary from current estimates.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in its portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us and the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.\nIn evaluating the adequacy of the Bank's allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous quantitative factors, including our historical charge-off experience, growth of our loan portfolio, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers. Finally, we consider many qualitative factors, including general and economic business conditions, duration of the current business cycle, current general market collateral valuations, trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters, which are by nature subjective and fluid. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding the Bank's borrowers' abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. In considering information about specific borrower situations, our analysis is subject to the risk that we are provided inaccurate or incomplete information. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the Bank's actual losses may vary from our current estimates.\nAdditionally, bank regulators periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the Bank's allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory authorities may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial success is dependent on the prevailing economic, political and business conditions as well as the population growth in South Dakota, Minnesota and North Dakota.\nOur success and growth is dependent on the income levels, deposits and population growth in our primary market area, which are communities located in eastern and central South Dakota, including the Sioux Falls metropolitan statistical area\n(\"MSA\") and the cities of Mitchell, Aberdeen, Brookings, Watertown and Yankton, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally are unfavorable, our business will be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities, including credit risk, which is the risk that borrowers may not repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing loans decreases. Our business operations and activities are predominantly concentrated in the state of South Dakota and most of our credit exposure is in that state, so we are specifically at risk from adverse economic, political and business conditions that affect South Dakota. Accordingly, economic and business conditions in South Dakota, such as increases in unemployment, commercial and consumer delinquencies and real estate foreclosures, as well as decreases in real gross domestic product, home and land prices or home sales, will each adversely impact our credit risk.\nFor example, credit card issuers are a significant employer in the Sioux Falls MSA. New regulation or other changes that negatively impact the credit card industry and cause these companies to scale back their operations and reduce personnel could negatively affect the economic conditions in South Dakota, which in return could negatively impact our credit risk and business.\nOur financial success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nWe operate in the highly competitive markets of South Dakota, Minnesota and North Dakota. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. Through the Bank, we compete for loans, deposits and other financial services in geographic markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. Larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can and have broader customer and geographic bases to draw upon.\nCompetitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us. Through the Bank, we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. There is a risk that we will not be able to compete successfully with these other financial institutions in our markets, and that we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits or charge lower interest rates to obtain loan volume, resulting in reduced profitability. In new markets that we may enter, we will also compete against well-established community banks that have developed relationships within the community.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations that may limit or restrict our activities, and the cost of compliance is high.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies, currently including the South Dakota DOB, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the DIF and depositors, not stockholders. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to regulatory capital requirements, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our ability to grow, our cost of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, and our ability to make acquisitions could be materially and adversely affected. See \u201cRegulation\u201d under Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for more detail about the regulations and their impact on our activities.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail expansion opportunities.\nThe USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist\norders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. We have developed policies and continue to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, however, we cannot guarantee they will be effective.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources to accommodate our existing and future lending and investment activities could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and severely constrain our financial flexibility. Our primary source of funding is retail deposits gathered through our network of branch offices. Our alternative funding sources include, without limitation, brokered certificates of deposit, federal funds purchased, Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings, FHLB of Des Moines advances and short- and long-term debt.\nThe Bank has historically obtained funds principally through local deposits and it has a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a cheaper and more stable source of funds than other borrowings, because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders and reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are higher cost time deposits.\nOur costs of funds, profitability and liquidity will be adversely affected to the extent we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank currently has a $15.0 million unsecured line of federal funds with First Tennessee Bank, NA, which did not have an outstanding balance at June 30, 2015 and 2014. The line was advanced upon during the past 12 months for contingent funding testing purposes.\nThe Bank currently has a $20.0 million unsecured line of federal funds with Zions Bank, which did not have an outstanding balance at June 30, 2015 and 2014. The line was advanced upon during the past 12 months for contingent funding testing purposes.\nWe may look to sell production assets, such as mortgage loans, into the secondary market as a means to manage the size of our balance sheet and manage the use of our capital. The demand for these products in the capital markets is not driven by us and may not benefit us at the time we look to sell the loans.\nOur liquidity, on a parent only basis, may be adversely affected by certain restrictions on receiving dividends from the Bank without prior regulatory approval.\nOur profitability may be affected by changes in market interest rates.\nThrough our banking subsidiary, the Bank, our profitability depends in large part on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and mortgage-backed securities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increase faster than the interest earned on loans and investments.\nOur results of operations will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of lending institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of U.S. government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. If short-term interest rates rise, and if rates on our deposits and borrowings re-price upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, we may experience compression of our net interest margin, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWhile we intend to manage the effects of changes in interest rates by adjusting the terms, maturities and pricing of our assets and liabilities, our efforts may not be effective in a changing rate environment and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nChanges in market interest rates or other conditions may have an adverse impact on the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities, stockholders\u2019 equity and profits.\nGAAP requires the Company to carry its available-for-sale securities at fair value on its balance sheet. Unrealized gains or losses on these securities, reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost, net of its tax effect, are included as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. When market rates of interest increase, the fair value of the Company\u2019s securities available-for-sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases. When rates decrease, fair value generally increases and stockholders\u2019 equity correspondingly increases. However, due to significant disruptions in global financial markets, such as those which occurred in 2008, this usual relationship can be disrupted.\nPrices and volumes of transactions in the nation\u2019s securities markets can be affected suddenly by economic crises, such as that experienced in the United States and internationally in 2008, or by other national or international crises, such as national disasters, acts of war or terrorism, changes in commodities markets, or instability in foreign governments. Disruptions in securities markets may detrimentally affect the value of securities that we hold in our investment portfolio, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks. There can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nRising interest rates will likely result in a decline in value of our fixed-rate debt securities. The unrealized losses resulting from holding these securities would be recognized in other comprehensive income (or net income, if the decline is other-than-temporary), and reduce total shareholders\u2019 equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios; however, tangible common equity and the associated ratios used by many investors would be reduced. If debt securities in an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses become realized and will reduce our regulatory capital ratios.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; therefore, we have a high degree of risk from a downturn in our real estate markets and the local economy and face risks that are unique to holding foreclosed real estate.\nA downturn in the real estate market and local economy in South Dakota, Minnesota and North Dakota could hurt our business because a significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate located in these states. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by, among other things, changes in regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and the availability of loans to potential purchasers. If real estate values decline, including farmland values, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nAdditionally, the Bank faces certain risks that are unique to holding foreclosed real estate, such as the risk that hazardous or toxic substances are found on the foreclosed property, which may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses to remediate or materially reduce the property's value. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to ensure that an environmental review is performed before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may turn out to be insufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard in connection with foreclosed real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant exposure to risks associated with the agriculture industry due to our loan concentration.\nAgricultural loans comprised 24.2% of our total loan and lease portfolio at June 30, 2015. A number of these loans have relatively large balances. Payments on agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loans. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. Our agricultural loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans, and the ability of the borrower to repay may be affected by many factors outside of the borrower's control, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm.\nIf the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary crops in our market areas are corn and soybeans. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural loan portfolio. While virtually all of our agricultural operating loan crop borrowers utilize federal crop insurance programs to insure against weather-related losses, we cannot be certain that insurance coverages will be adequate to fully satisfy cash flow and associated operating requirements. Furthermore, any extended period of low commodity prices, significantly reduced yields on crops, reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry and/or reduced farmland values could result in a significant increase in our nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming\nloans could result in a loss of net income from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute existing stockholders and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities in the normal course of our business. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we may not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, thrifts, or financial service companies, as well as other geographic and product expansion activities, involve various risks including:\n\u2022\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u2022\nrisks that acquired new businesses do not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets or product areas where we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions, and start-up delays and costs of other expansion activities;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions to our business;\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u2022\npotential short-term decreases in profitability; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management's time and attention from our existing operations and business.\nWe may participate in FDIC-assisted acquisitions, which could present additional risks to our financial condition.\nWe may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of troubled financial institutions in transactions facilitated by the FDIC. In addition to the risks frequently associated with acquisitions, an acquisition of a troubled financial institution may involve a greater risk that the acquired assets under perform compared to our expectations. Because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition, including preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks including, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. Additionally, while the FDIC may agree to assume certain losses in transactions that it facilitates, there can be no assurances that we would not be required to raise additional capital as a condition to, or as a result of, participation in an FDIC-assisted transaction. Any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWe expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in acquiring other banks, thrifts, and financial service companies. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and stockholders' equity per share of our common stock.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by regulatory agencies to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations and such levels may be increased by legislative and regulatory developments. To complete any future acquisitions and expansion activities, we may need to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through organic or external growth could be materially impaired.\nIn the event that we are able to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities, the ownership interests of current investors would be diluted and the per share book value of our common stock may be diluted. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock, which may adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks, especially relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Furthermore, we have access to large amounts of confidential financial information and control substantial financial assets, including those belonging to our customers, to whom we offer remote access, and we regularly transfer substantial financial assets by electronic means. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful.\nIn addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints caused by third parties that facilitate our business activities by providing technology such as software applications, as well as financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure.\nWe also face the potential risk of losses due to fraud, including commercial checking account fraud, automated teller machine (\"ATM\") skimming and trapping, write-offs necessitated by debit card fraud, and other forms of online banking fraud, which are being more sophisticated and present new challenges as mobile banking increases, as well as employee fraud. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be\nsuccessful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, assimilate and retain highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nAs a community bank, we expect our future growth to be driven in large part by the relationships that our personnel maintain with our customers. We depend on the talents and leadership of our executive team, including Stephen M. Bianchi, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brent R. Olthoff, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. There is an increasing risk in our industry around the lack of human capital with experience, training and skills in financial services. Therefore, the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense. The inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nAdverse weather affecting the markets we serve could hurt our business and prospects for growth.\nThe South Dakota economy, in general, is heavily dependent on agriculture and therefore the overall South Dakota economy, and particularly the economies of the rural communities that we serve, can be greatly affected by severe weather conditions, including droughts, storms, tornadoes and flooding. Unfavorable weather conditions may decrease agricultural productivity or could result in damage to our branch locations or the property of our customers, all of which could adversely affect the local economy. An adverse effect on the economy of South Dakota would negatively affect our profitability.\nChanges in or interpretations of accounting standards may materially impact our financial statements.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, interpretations and practices for many aspects of our business are complex and involve subjective judgments, including, but not limited to, accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses and pending and incurred but not reported health claims. Changes in these estimates or changes in other accounting rules and principles, or their interpretation, could significantly change our reported net income and operating results, and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations.\nThe holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders.\nWe have supported our continued growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying sales of junior subordinated debentures to these trusts. The accompanying junior subordinated debentures have an aggregate liquidation amount totaling $24.8 million at June 30, 2015. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures that we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, experienced significant volatility during the recent economic downturn. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. Furthermore, the trading price of the shares of our common stock depends on many other factors that may change from time to time and may be beyond our control. This may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nAmong the factors that could affect our stock price are those identified in the section entitled \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and as follows:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts' revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u2022\nactions by our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and/or directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022\ntrading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;\n\u2022\ndomestic and local economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nOur ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from our banking subsidiary, the Bank, which is subject to regulatory limits.\nWe are a bank holding company and our operations are conducted primarily by our banking subsidiary, the Bank. Since we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nDividend payments from the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net income and retained earnings. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The Bank may not be able to generate adequate cash flow to pay us dividends in the future. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive the dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, we may elect in the future to defer interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures discussed above. The debenture agreements prohibit dividend payments on our common stock following the deferral of interest payments on the subordinated debentures underlying the trust preferred securities.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been low, and the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the price of our common stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed to trade on The NASDAQ Global Market and the trading in our common shares has substantially less liquidity than many other companies listed on NASDAQ. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future or that it will not decrease.\nAs a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock on short notice. Additionally, thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock at one time could depress the market price of our common stock, making it difficult for you to sell your shares and impairing our ability to raise capital.\nWe may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We may evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios, financial condition and other relevant considerations, and subject to market conditions, we may take further capital actions. Such actions could include, among other things, the issuance of shares of common stock in public or private transactions in order to further increase our capital levels above the requirements for a well-capitalized institution established by the federal bank regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory targets.\nWe face significant regulatory and other governmental risks as a financial institution, and it is possible that capital requirements and directives could in the future require us to change the amount or composition of our current capital, including common equity.\nThe issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Delaware and federal law, may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of control of us.\nCertain provisions included in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and federal law, may discourage, delay or prevent potential acquisitions of control of us, particularly when attempted in a transaction that is not negotiated directly with, and approved by, our Board of Directors, despite possible benefits to our stockholders.\nSpecifically, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as the case may be, include certain provisions that:\n\u2022\nlimit the voting power of shares held by a stockholder beneficially owning in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that certain business combinations between us and a stockholder beneficially owning in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, or be approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote if the business combination (i) is approved by a majority of the Board of Directors serving prior to the 10% stockholder becoming such, and/or (ii) involves consideration per share generally equal to that paid by such 10% stockholder when such stockholder acquired his, her or its stock;\n\u2022\ndivide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms and provide that a director may only be removed prior to the expiration of a term for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in an election of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that a special meeting of stockholders be called pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire that an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of our directors then in office and thereafter by our stockholders by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a stockholders meeting called for that purpose; provided, however, with respect to the amendment of certain provisions regarding, among other things, provisions relating to the voting limits of holders of more than 10% of our common stock, the number, classification, election and removal of directors, amendment of the Bylaws, call of special stockholder meetings, acquisitions of control, director liability, and certain business combinations, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of our capital stock required by applicable law or by our Certificate of Incorporation, such amendments must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of our then-outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nFurthermore, federal law requires Federal Reserve approval prior to any direct or indirect acquisition of \"control\" (as defined in Federal Reserve regulations) of the Bank, including any acquisition of control of us. By statute, a company would be found to \"control\" the Bank if the Company: (1) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company or Bank; (2) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the Company's or Bank's board; or (3) directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company and Bank. The Federal Reserve's implementing regulations include a specific definition of \"control\" similar to the statutory definition, with certain additional provisions. In addition to the rebuttable presumptions of control set forth in the implementing regulations, the Federal Reserve's supervision manual for supervised institutions provides that there are a number of other circumstances that are indicative of control and may call for further investigation to uncover facts that support a determination of control.", "PERMNO": 77507, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HFFC"}
