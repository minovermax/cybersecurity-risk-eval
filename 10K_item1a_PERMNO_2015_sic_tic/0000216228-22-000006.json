{"cik": "216228", "company": "ITT Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance. Because of these factors, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results. You should carefully consider, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks may have an adverse material effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition to these risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to most or all companies.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nOur financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of supply chain challenges, restrictions or vaccination requirements imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments, and general market reactions to the risks posed by COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures enacted by federal, state and local governments to contain the outbreak have caused, and continue to cause, significant disruptions in our businesses and in the global industries where we operate. These disruptions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the occurrence of the following:\n\u2022the emergence of variant strains of the virus, including Delta and Omicron, as well as the timing, effectiveness and availability of, and people\u2019s receptivity to, vaccines or other medical remedies;\n\u2022government-mandated site closures, employee illness, skilled labor shortages, the impact of potential travel restrictions, stay-in-place restrictions, and vaccination requirements on our business and workforce (see risk factor related to government contracting for additional information);\n\u2022missed or late customer deliveries due to labor shortages or disruptions in our global supply chain as a result of congested shipping ports around the world, delayed supplier deliveries, supplier performance or financial concerns, or the inability to procure supplier inputs at reasonable prices or at all; and\n\u2022delays in collections or an inability to collect on customer receivables, including due to customer bankruptcy.\nWith respect to vaccination requirements that could impact our business and workforce, on November 5, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) in the Federal Register, mandating either full vaccination or at least weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. However, following legal challenges, OSHA withdrew the ETS and is prioritizing its resources to focus on finalizing a permanent COVID-19 healthcare standard. In addition, in Italy and Germany, which produced sales of 24% and 11% of our consolidated 2021 revenue, respectively, the government has mandated proof of vaccination, a negative rapid swab test, or recent recovery from a COVID-19 infection to be able to go to the workplace. These mandates went into effect during the fourth quarter of 2021. At this time, we cannot predict the scope of any future legislation the U.S. federal government may seek to implement regarding vaccination mandates, or the impact that the Italian or German vaccination mandates, or potential future legislation, whether in the U.S. or abroad, may have on our workforce or business operations\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments that are not within our control, including, but not limited to, the severity and duration of the pandemic, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or other medical remedies against COVID-19, the effectiveness of government stimulus programs, the severity of a resurgence of COVID-19 or new strains of the virus, the extent to which people continue to work from home, restrictions on or people's attitudes towards travel, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. At this time, we cannot predict the duration or full magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, the various governmental containment measures or the resulting disruptions to our markets and our business. The longer the pandemic continues, including as a result of a resurgence of the virus or the emergence of a more severe strain of the virus, the more likely that the foregoing risks will be realized and that other negative impacts on our business will occur, including some that we are unable to currently predict.\nOur operating results and our ability to maintain liquidity or procure capital have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by unfavorable or uncertain global economic and capital market conditions.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in revenues, operating results and profitability due to uncertain global economic and capital market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic. We have undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets and expansion of the geographic regions in which we operate. The end markets we serve include automotive, aerospace, energy, industrial, mining, chemical, and defense, each of which is impacted by specific industry and general economic cycles. Important factors impacting our businesses include, but are not limited to, the overall strength of the global economy and our customers\u2019 confidence in local and global macroeconomic conditions, industrial spending, tax rates, interest rates, the availability of commercial financing, and regulations and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Instability in the global credit markets and geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets or regions deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our financial statements.\nWe closely monitor the credit-worthiness of our customers and evaluate their ability to meet their obligations. However, adverse changes to financial conditions could jeopardize these counterparty obligations. A tightening of credit markets may reduce funds available to our customers to pay for our products and services for a prolonged and perhaps unknown period of time. Restrictive credit markets may also result in customers extending terms for payment and may result in us having higher customer receivables with increased risk of default.\nShould market conditions deteriorate, this may also adversely affect our ability to manage inventory levels and maintain current levels of profitability. We could lose access to commercial paper markets or to our currently available lines of credit. We could be required to raise additional capital and be unable to do so or able to do so only on unfavorable terms. Deteriorating market conditions could also indicate an impairment in the value of our goodwill and intangible assets in one or more of our reporting units which would require us to recognize a non-cash charge to our Statement of Operations. We test both goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In doing so, in the first quarter of 2020, we determined that certain intangible assets within our IP segment, including an indefinite-lived trademark, customer relationships and proprietary technology, would not be recoverable, which resulted in us recognizing a non-cash charge of $12.3.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by raw material price volatility and the inability of suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, components and contract manufacturing services to produce our products. The supply of raw materials to ITT and to its component parts suppliers has been, and may continue to be, interrupted for a variety of reasons, including worldwide supply chain challenges, shipping issues, and demand for and availability of key raw materials. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or the required materials have historically been readily available. In limited instances, we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers. Although we believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source supplier materials, if necessary, the transition to an alternative source could be complex, costly, and protracted, especially if the change requires us to redesign our systems. Delays in obtaining supplies have resulted from, and may continue to result from, a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including the COVID-19 pandemic, congested shipping ports around the world, production interruptions, capacity constraints, labor disputes or shortages, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the ability to meet regulatory requirements, and commitments to other purchasers. Any delay in our suppliers\u2019 abilities to provide us with sufficient quality or flow of materials or any supplier price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers or may significantly impact our profitability. In addition, commodity prices and the prices for other raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly, and in 2021, the increase in raw materials and shipping costs negatively impacted our financial results. We have not always been able to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our sales growth and profitability.\nFailure to innovate, protect our intellectual property rights, provide high-quality products, or respond to competitors could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance, reliability and innovation, application expertise, enforcement of intellectual property rights, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of distribution channels, and price.\nMaintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. Insufficient investment in these areas may result in a failure to maintain our competitive position. In addition, our existing competitors, or potential new competitors, may develop products that are cheaper and/or superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. These pressures may result in us having to take actions, such as adjusting the prices of certain products, in order to stay competitive.\nObtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights is another factor that is critical to the success of our business and our ability to remain competitive. For certain products and manufacturing processes, we rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to protect these rights. These contracts may be breached, or may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar products. In addition, during the normal course of business, we could unintentionally infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property litigation could be time consuming for management, and could result in significant legal expense to either pursue claims against others, or to defend ourselves. If we are unable to protect our patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe or violate the rights of others, our ability to remain competitive could be adversely impacted.\nWe manufacture key components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in the markets we serve. The reliability and performance of our products are critically important to our customers and the users of their products. Accordingly, quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the potentially costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications, including products manufactured to military specifications, are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. Our success in part depends on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, we could damage our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components, which could hurt our ability to remain competitive and result in a loss of customers, market share, or product sales.\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is experiencing a skilled labor shortage and if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, including senior management and engineering talent, our ability to operate or grow our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe manufacturing industry is currently experiencing a skilled labor shortage. This shortage has created difficulties for the Company in attracting and retaining factory employees and in meeting customer demand. We currently have a significant number of open positions and we expect this to remain so in 2022. A failure to attract or retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, or our ability to grow our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and public health responses to the pandemic, including potential vaccination mandates, could increase employee attrition and make it more difficult to secure future labor needs. Our future success will continue to depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract or retain senior management, engineers, and other key personnel, which will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, training, flexibility, and other benefits that prospective employees desire.\nOur operations could be disrupted and our business could be materially and adversely affected by our inability to prevent, detect or adequately respond to cyber security breaches.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties. In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties and personally identifiable information of our employees.\nOur information technology systems and those of third party service providers may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks, and user errors. Although we actively manage the risks to our information systems that are within our control, we can provide no assurance that our actions or those of our third party service providers will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks or data. If we experience a disruption in our information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could materially adversely affect our business. Even the most well-protected information systems are vulnerable to internal and external security breaches including, but not limited to, those by computer hackers and cyber terrorists utilizing\ntechniques such as phishing, ransomware, or denial of service attacks. As a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, and particularly as a government contractor, we are subject to a heightened risk of security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism, including by foreign governments and cyber terrorists. Furthermore, information technology security threats are increasing in sophistication, intensity, and frequency. A security breach may occur, including breaches that we may be unable to detect. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could cause significant disruption to our business or could result in decreased performance and increased costs.\nThe processing and storage of certain information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations, and many such regulations are country-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are uncertain, evolving and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Compliance with these various laws may be onerous and require us to incur substantial costs or to change our business practices in a manner that adversely affects our business, while failure to comply with such laws may subject us to substantial penalties.\nIf we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving privacy and data security regulations and government cyber security requirements for government contractors, potentially causing us to lose business. A breach could also result in the loss of our intellectual property, potentially impacting our long-term capability to compete for sales of affected products. In addition, a breach of security of our information systems could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as increased costs to implement further information security measures. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to cyber security breaches, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a single customer. Loss of this customer, a loss of business with this customer, or a reduction in this customer's market share, could adversely impact our financial results.\nSales to Continental, a supplier to the automotive industry and ITT's largest customer, were approximately 10% of our total revenue in 2021. Automaker requests to use ITT brake pads in their Continental-produced braking systems (calipers) typically account for approximately half of MT's revenue from Continental. These automaker requests are generally formalized through supply agreements signed directly between MT and automakers. The remainder of MT's sales to Continental is generated from a 10-year agreement to supply Continental with aftermarket parts, which is set to expire in 2023. We are currently in discussions with Continental to renew this agreement, and we anticipate we will reach an agreement with Continental in the near future. The loss of this customer, failure to renew this long-term aftermarket agreement on terms at least as favorable as the current contract or at all, or a reduction in this customer's market share could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nDue to our operations and sales outside of the U.S., we are subject to inherent business risks, including the imposition of tariffs and significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing portion of our operations and are a strategic focus for continued future growth. Our sales in emerging markets such as Mexico, South America, China, Russia, and the Middle East have been increasing. In 2021, 70% of our total sales were to customers operating outside of the United States compared to 67% in 2020. Our sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States. These risks include the following, some of which could be impacted by changes in international trade agreements or the imposition or increase of tariffs or trade sanctions between the United States and other countries:\n\u2022possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u2022restrictions, regulations, or tax liabilities on currency repatriation;\n\u2022potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u2022the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions;\n\u2022changes in tariffs and trade barriers, sanctioned countries and individuals, and import and export licensing requirements; and\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nOur operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties, including risks that governments may impose limitations or prohibitions on our ability to repatriate funds, impose or increase withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, seek to nationalize our assets, or impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including challenges to our ability to protect our intellectual property, pressure on the pricing of our products, and risks of political instability.\nBeginning in 2018, the U.S. government undertook a series of actions to increase tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S., including steel and aluminum, and in response governments in Europe and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on various goods, including on certain goods we sell into those countries. The tariffs with Europe largely remained in place until the fourth quarter of 2021 and the tariffs with China remain in place. These tariffs have negatively impacted demand for our products as well as the cost of certain parts and materials that we purchase from vendors located in these countries. We have been mitigating, and will continue attempting to mitigate, the impact of these tariffs by lowering input costs through efficient utilization of our global manufacturing footprint, supplier and customer negotiations, and diversification strategies. However, we expect that continued trade disputes between the U.S. and China and other countries, and other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies may continue to adversely impact demand for our products as well as our costs.\nThe cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable profit margins.\nBecause a significant portion of our sales are to customers operating outside the U.S., our financial results are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. The primary foreign currencies to which we have exposure are the Euro, Chinese renminbi, Czech koruna, South Korean won, Hong Kong dollar, and Saudi riyal. Any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could impact our ability to sell products or control costs. In addition, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their respective local currencies (i.e., functional currencies), which are then translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. As the relationship between these foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, our financial results could be adversely affected upon translation. From time to time, we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge some of these foreign currency exposures. However, our hedging strategy may fail to reduce our exposure and could even result in an unfavorable impact to our financial results.\nOur business is impacted by our customers' levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures, particularly in the aerospace, energy, chemical, and mining markets.\nDemand for certain aerospace and industrial products and services depends on the level of capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures of our customers which, in turn, depend on general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries, volatility in commodity prices, expectations of future market behavior, and their liquidity and financial position. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industries, such as the condition of global credit and capital markets. For example, demand for our aerospace products, including connectors, has historically been driven by demand from the aviation industry for new aircraft and maintenance, repair, and overhaul services, which continue to suffer from reduced global air travel arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, some of our customers have chosen to postpone capital investment and maintenance, and may continue doing so in the future, potentially even during favorable conditions in their industries or markets, which has led, and may continue leading, to a delay or cancellation of orders.\nOur customer's businesses, particularly those in the energy, chemical, and mining industries, which represented approximately 8%, 9%, and 3%, respectively, of our 2021 revenue, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic downturns of varying severity. For example, the volatility of the energy market has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future gas and oil prices, which are influenced by numerous supply and demand factors, including availability and cost of capital, global and domestic economic conditions, environmental regulations, policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries and Russia, and other factors. Our customers in these industries, particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit-driven, historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Additionally, fluctuating energy demand forecasts and commodity pricing and other macroeconomic factors may cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning, which could reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced\ndemand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA material business interruption, particularly at one of our manufacturing facilities, could negatively impact our ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.\nIf operations at one or more of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of an equipment failure, natural disaster, power outage, fire, explosion, act of terrorism, war, IT system failure, cyber-attack, adverse weather condition, labor dispute, epidemic or pandemic illness (including without limitation, COVID-19), relocation of production location, or any other reason, our ability to meet customer demand for our products may be impacted. We have business continuity plans in place to mitigate the effects of such interruptions, but these plans may not be sufficient to resolve the issues in a timely manner. A significant interruption in production capability could also require us to make substantial payments due to non-performance. We also have insurance for certain covered losses which we believe to be adequate to offset a significant portion of the costs for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as certain financial losses resulting from production interruptions or shutdowns. However, any recovery under our insurance policies would be subject to deductibles and, depending on the coverage, may not offset the lost revenues or increased expenses that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.\nNew or recent mergers or acquisitions could present operational challenges and past divestitures and spin-offs may expose us to potential liabilities, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through the acquisition of other companies, assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing businesses. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase, a level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses and their operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of, or challenges facing, the acquired businesses and their operations. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial results, and business. These include the possibility that:\n\u2022an acquired business could under-perform relative to our expectations,\n\u2022we could fail to realize the expected synergies of an acquisition,\n\u2022we could experience difficulties in the integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems,\n\u2022we could have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities,\n\u2022there could be insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis,\n\u2022management attention could be diverted from other businesses,\n\u2022we could lose key employees of the acquired businesses,\n\u2022we could experience increased capital requirements, and\n\u2022the acquisition could result in customer dissatisfaction.\nWe have divested a number of businesses, including as part of spin-offs in 1995 and 2011. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to indemnify the counterparties against, or otherwise retain, certain liabilities, including, certain lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims, and environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to liabilities arising out of such divestitures. In addition, the counterparties to those divestitures may have agreed to indemnify us or assume certain liabilities relating to those divestitures. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity or assumption of liability by the counterparties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these liabilities, or that a counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that a counterparty agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which we were initially held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. From time to time, we make minority investments in other companies and we risk losing part or all of our capital in any such investment.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social and governance, or sustainability responsibilities could expose us to additional costs and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and share price.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers and other key stakeholders on corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including climate change. Some investors have used, and may continue to use, ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, have chosen, and may continue to choose, not to invest in ITT, or to divest their holdings of ITT, if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate.\nThe ESG factors by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed have been evolving and may continue to evolve. Additionally, the requirements of U.S. public companies in regards to ESG compliance has been increasing and may continue to increase. This has resulted in greater expectations of us and have caused us, and may continue causing us, to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we are unable to satisfy new corporate responsibility criteria, investors may conclude our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We risk damage to our brand and reputation in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead, which we have experienced to date. In addition, in the event we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation, employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us, financial results, and share price could be materially and adversely affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to risks related to government contracting, including changes in levels of government spending and regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.\nOur Connect & Control Technologies and Motion Technologies segments derive a portion of their revenue from sales to U.S. government customers and higher tier contractors who sell to the U.S. government. The government's expenditures are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products. In addition, the award, administration and performance of government contracts is subject to regulatory and contractual requirements that differ significantly from the terms and conditions that apply to contracts with our non-governmental customers. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations to evaluate our compliance with these requirements. If we are found to have failed to comply with requirements applicable to government contractors, we may be subject to various actions, including but not limited to fines or penalties, reductions in the value of our government contracts, restrictions on the sale of certain products to the government, or suspension or debarment from government contracting. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell equivalent commercial products.\nOn September 9, 2021, U.S. President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors, that work on or in support of U.S. government contracts, are fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021, and it only permits limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons. The deadline date was ultimately adjusted to January 18, 2022. However, a federal court in Georgia has subsequently issued a nationwide injunction that bars the federal government from enforcing vaccine mandate clauses in covered contracts and subcontracts during the pendency of the case. At this time, we cannot predict whether the executive order will withstand judicial scrutiny or when it might be enforced, whether the federal government will seek to pass new legislation regarding vaccine mandates, or the impact the order or potential future legislation or similar mandates issued in other jurisdictions where we have government contracts may have on our workforce or business operations.\nIf we are not able to meet the requirements for government contractors, we may lose orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in our effective tax rates as a result of changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets, the geographic mix of earnings, tax examinations or disputes, tax authority rulings, or changes in the tax laws, may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain income or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income in future periods. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including changes in the geographic mix of our profits among jurisdictions with differing statutory income tax rates; sustainability of historical income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business; changes in tax laws applicable to us; expiration, renewal, or application of tax holidays; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\nThe amount of income taxes and other taxes we have paid are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts paid or reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. We are currently under routine examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWe are closely monitoring the potential passage of new U.S. tax legislation, which could result in substantial changes to the current U.S. tax system, including changes to the statutory corporate tax rate. In addition, we are evaluating changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate. As the effects of a change in U.S. tax law must be recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted, should new legislation be signed into law, our financial results could be materially impacted.\nChanges in environmental laws or regulations, the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, or the failure of a potentially responsible party to perform may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals, gases and other substances used in manufacturing our products that could require us to incur substantial expenses. Environmental laws and regulations allow for the assessment of substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. The discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination at a site which the Company previously operated or currently operates could suddenly subject the Company to costly remediation efforts. We could be affected directly or indirectly through impacts on our customers and suppliers by changes in environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to vapor intrusion or climate change concerns and violations by us of such laws and regulations. We may also be impacted by the adequacy of insurance policies, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other potentially responsible parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels, including nuclear, wind, solar and bio-fuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency, could reduce demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by our IP customers.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, as well as export controls and trade sanctions, could result in fines or criminal penalties.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or applicable non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, trade sanctions and regulation, and other laws including but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Even the allegation or appearance of our employees, agents or business partners acting improperly or illegally could damage our reputation and result in significant expenditures in investigating and responding to such actions.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and potential claims relating to product liability.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of products for the markets we serve. In addition, many of the devices we manufacture and sell are critical components designed to be used in harsh environments for long periods of time where the cost of failure is high. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, an end-user of our products. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of such products from the marketplace and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, the articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of \"control shares\" of an \"issuing public corporation.\"", "PERMNO": 12570, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "ITT"}
