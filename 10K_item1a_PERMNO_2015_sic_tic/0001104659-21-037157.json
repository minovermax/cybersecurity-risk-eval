{"cik": "1314772", "company": "Summer Infant, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risk factors listed below are not exhaustive. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new factors may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nWe face risks related to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our business in 2020, and may continue to impact our business and financial performance.\nIn 2020, we saw the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impact the global economy, disrupt global supply chains and create significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic exposes us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 Operational risks. Early in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruption as most of our product is sourced from China, which experienced widespread shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019/early 2020. While we have seen production from China returning to normal levels, if there is another outbreak of COVID-19 in China, our supply chain could again be disrupted. Our suppliers located in other countries may also experience shutdowns due to COVID-19 outbreaks that may impact our supply chain.\nIn the U.S., we have continued to operate our distribution center in California, as products are considered \u201cessential.\u201d While we have implemented additional safety measures for our workers in the distribution center, we may be required to temporarily close the facility if there are any confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the facility, which would impact our ability to timely ship product to our customers.\n\u00b7 Customer-related risks. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our customers closed retail stores, and given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, in some cases have closed locations or have operated at a reduced level. While we are cautiously optimistic that vaccination efforts in the U.S. may result in a return to a more normal level of retail consumer activity, we cannot predict how our customers will adjust to demand, and if demand will continue to shift to online activity. To the extent these customers, especially our mid-size and smaller customers, experience financial difficulties as a result of the pandemic, we may see these customers permanently close stores, reduce orders, or file for bankruptcy, thus impacting sales.\nIn addition to the specific risks to our business noted above, we will also be subject to the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the U.S. economy as a whole. While economic stimulus efforts in the U.S. may alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged, or if it worsens, it will likely continue to impact consumer discretionary spending, and therefore demand for our products. In addition to the risks specifically described above, the impact of COVID-19 is likely to implicate and exacerbate other risks disclosed in this Item 1A.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition\nThe concentration of our business with certain retail customers means that changes in the purchasing policies of these customers could have a significant impact on our business and operating results.\nIn fiscal 2020, sales to our top seven customers, including Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, and Target, accounted for approximately 87% of our total sales. We do not have long-term commitments or contracts with any of our retail customers, and retailers make purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. As such, any customer could potentially renegotiate the terms of our business relationship at any time, which might include reducing overall purchases of our products, altering pricing, reducing the number and variety of our products carried and the shelf space allotted for our products, and reducing cooperative advertising or marketing support. Because of the current concentration of our business with these retail customers, a change in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased tariffs, additional tariffs or other import or export taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on the cost of our products, the demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, including products imported into the United States from China. The majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States, mainly in China, and imported for sale in the United States. Tariffs enacted in 2019 impacted our 2019 and 2020 results, and caused market disruption amongst our major customers in 2019. In addition, while exclusions from tariffs were granted for certain of our products in 2019 and 2020, these exclusions have now expired and we do not expect that any further exclusions will be granted.\nWhile we have taken actions to mitigate the impact of these tariffs and are exploring alternative sources of supply outside of China, if existing tariffs are increased or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States, China or other countries, the cost of our products manufactured in China or other countries and imported into the United States would increase substantially, which would force us to increase the prices of the affected products.\nThere is no assurance that we would be successful in mitigating the impact of increased or additional tariffs, and any increase in pricing to allow us to maintain reasonable margins could adversely affect the demand for those products and may result in decreased profitability and lower sales, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not appropriately manage our supply chain, maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or on a timely basis, or if our inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur business places stringent demands on our inventory forecasting and production planning processes. This inventory management approach may be particularly challenging when combined with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory management systems commonly used by customers to minimize their inventory levels. If we fail to meet tight shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with customers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic can impact timely delivery of our products. To deliver our merchandise on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. This approach requires us to begin to place orders for components for certain products up to a year in advance, and we procure a significant amount of product months in advance of certain time periods. At the time we place factory orders, we may not have firm orders from customers or a complete understanding of what consumer demand for those products will be. If our inventory forecasting processes are not accurate, it may result in inventory levels in excess of the levels forecasted and we may not have sufficient space at our main distribution center to accommodate excess inventory. As a result, we could be required to record inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, and/or incur additional expense for storage of excess inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if our processes result in our inventory levels being too low to meet customer demand, we may lose sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. Logistical challenges related to the lack of availability of truckers, containers and shippers is a risk which could cause delays in procuring product for vendors as well as shipping to customers, and could ultimately result in significant increases in transportation costs.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of or savings from our restructuring initiatives, and our restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2020, we announced restructuring initiatives to further streamline our operations and improve our financial outlook. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that are initially anticipated in connection with these restructuring initiatives. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees\u2019 time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If these initiatives are not implemented in a timely manner, anticipated cost savings and benefits are not realized, business disruption occurs during the pendency of or following such actions, or unanticipated charges are incurred, particularly if material, there may be a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe intense competition in our market could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and compete with several large domestic and foreign companies and with smaller producers of infant and juvenile products. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, or have greater e-commerce and social media presence than us. We experience price competition for our products and competition for shelf space at retailers, all of which may increase in the future. In addition, with the acceleration in consumers purchasing online, there is a low barrier to entry into our market for newer, smaller companies that solely operate an e-commerce business. If we cannot adjust to changes in our market and compete successfully in the future, our net sales and profitability will likely decline.\nOur ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not successfully satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and successfully market and achieve acceptance of our products.\nOur business and operating results depend largely upon providing our customers with products that appeal to the end user. Consumer preferences are constantly changing, particularly among parents whom are often the end purchasers of our products. Our success largely depends on our ability to identify emerging trends in the infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness marketplace, and to design quality products that address consumer preferences and prove safe and cost effective.\nOur ability to maintain and increase our current market share will depend upon our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and satisfy these preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, grow existing distribution channels and seek additional distribution channels for these products, successfully market the products and, ultimately, achieve consumer acceptance of these products. A failure to achieve market acceptance of our products could harm our ability to grow our business.\nAn inability to develop and introduce planned new products or product lines in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nIn developing new products and product lines, we have anticipated dates for associated product introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future, those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, marketing work, and manufacturing in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products, and delays in the manufacturing process may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be discontinued. The risk is also heightened by the sophistication of certain products we are designing, in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. If we are unable to manufacture, source and ship new products in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nCovenants in our loan agreement may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions. Deviations from expected results of operations and expected cash requirements could result in a failure to meet financial covenants, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the credit facility under our loan agreement and cash generated from our operations to meet our working capital needs. Our loan agreement includes certain covenants that place limitations on or restrict a number of our activities, including our ability to incur additional debt, create liens on our assets or make guarantees, make certain investments or loans, pay dividends or make distributions, dispose of or sell assets, or enter into a merger or similar transaction.\nThese restrictive covenants may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. Any significant deviation in actual results from our expected results of operations, or in the timing of material expenditures from current estimates, any significant business or product acquisitions, or other significant unanticipated expenses could result in us not meeting applicable financial covenants.\nNon-compliance with the covenants in our loan agreement could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our credit facility, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. If access to our credit facility is limited or terminated, our liquidity would be constrained, affecting our operations and growth prospects, and we would need to seek amendments to our credit facility or obtain additional equity or debt financing or face default. There is no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants that could impede our ability to effectively operate and grow our business in the future.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our PPP loan, and our application for the Paycheck Protection Program Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nIn August 2020, we received loan proceeds of approximately $1,956 (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). We used the PPP Loan to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is generally available if proceeds were used for qualifying expenses in accordance with the CARES Act. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven may be reduced in certain circumstances, including as a result of certain headcount or salary reductions. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. On February 18, 2021, the Company applied for full forgiveness of the PPP loan through Bank of America and the application is currently under review by Bank of America.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. If, despite our good-faith belief that given our circumstances we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we are later determined to have violated any applicable laws or regulations that may apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties, which could also result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity problems or bankruptcy of our key retail customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is with key retail customers. Due to the current pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, there is increased risk that retailers may suffer material losses or file for a petition for bankruptcy. Sales to retail customers are typically made on credit without collateral. If a customer files for bankruptcy, our pre-petition accounts receivable may not be realized and post-petition orders reduced or cancelled. The bankruptcy laws may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition accounts receivable. If key customers, cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy, or significantly reduce the number of stores operated and therefore the amount of products ordered from us, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to access availability under our credit facility.\nBecause we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell our products in foreign markets, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products, resulting in a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nWhile most of our sales continue to be in North America, we operate facilities and sell products in countries outside the United States. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party suppliers and manufacturers located in Asia to produce a majority of our products. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022 economic and political instability;\n\u2022 restrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u2022 greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 trade restrictions;\n\u2022 work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\t\n\u2022 reduction in business activity in some parts of the world;\n\u2022 currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022 changes in import duties or import or export restrictions;\t\n\u2022 compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;\n\u2022 untimely shipping of product and unloading of product through West Coast ports, as well as untimely truck delivery to our warehouses;\n\u2022 complications in complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the importation of goods, including duties, quotas, and taxes;\n\u2022 limitations on repatriation of foreign earnings; and\n\u2022 complications in complying with foreign tax laws.\nFuture changes to the U.S. tariff and import/export regulations could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Due to our reliance of manufacturers located in China, from which we import a majority of our products, the occurrence of such trade reforms or restrictions could impact our business in an adverse manner.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition.\nAlso, because we generate some of our revenue outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar is strong against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenue or expense could result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenue and expense.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with our suppliers could harm our business.\nWe rely on numerous third-party suppliers located in Asia for the manufacture of most of our products. While we believe that alternative suppliers could be located if required, our product sourcing could be affected if any of these suppliers do not continue to manufacture our products in required quantities or at all, or with the required levels of quality. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with our foreign suppliers; rather, we enter into purchase orders with these suppliers. In addition, difficulties encountered by these suppliers in the countries where they operate, such as fire, accident, natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, or political unrest, could halt or disrupt production at the affected locations, resulting in delay or cancellation of orders. For instance, the recent coronavirus outbreak in China may result in delays in manufacturing of our products due to closure of factories and delays in shipping products to the U.S., which could impact our sale forecasts and inventory levels. Any of these events could result in delayed deliveries by us of our products, causing reduced sales and harm to our reputation and brand name.\nIncreases in the cost of materials or labor used to manufacture our products could decrease our profitability and therefore negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nBecause our products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, we do not directly purchase the materials used in the manufacture of our products. However, the prices paid by us to these suppliers could increase if raw materials, labor, or other costs increase. If we cannot pass these increases along to our customers, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nEarthquakes, floods, fire, epidemics or other catastrophic events out of our control may damage or impact the operations of our primary distribution facility and harm our results of operations.\nOur primary distribution facility is located in Riverside, California, near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, flood, fire, or other natural or manmade disaster, could impact operations at this facility. In addition, the state of California has declared a state of emergency related to the recent coronavirus outbreak, and operations at our distribution facility could be disrupted or required to close if there are any employees who are diagnosed with the coronavirus or there is a governmentally-imposed quarantine or other geographic limitations imposed on companies doing business in California. Any of these events could impair distribution of our products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions, or otherwise affect our business negatively, harming our results of operations.\nIntellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, from time to time, claims of alleged infringement of patents relating to certain of our products, and we may face similar claims in the future. The defense of intellectual property claims can be costly and time consuming, even in circumstances where the claim is without merit. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in order to resolve these types of claims. In addition, these claims could materially harm our brand name, reputation and operations.\nAs a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits, product recalls, and other claims relating to the use of our products, which could harm our business.\nBecause we produce infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulation and face product liability risks relating to consumer use of our products. We must comply with a variety of state and federal product safety and product testing regulations. In particular, our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (\u201cFHSA\u201d) and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (\u201cCPSIA\u201d), which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d), to take action against hazards presented by consumer products. With expanded authority under the CPSIA, the CPSC has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to our products. These regulations have or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of children\u2019s products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations. The CPSC has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous. Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in Canada and Europe, as well as certain other countries. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we face product liability claims, we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage and we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements.\nWe maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. A product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect our reputation and the sales of other products. Furthermore, concerns about potential liability may lead us to voluntarily recall selected products. Complying with existing or new regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense if our products were found to not comply with such regulations.\nIn addition to product liability risks relating to the use by consumers of our products, we also must comply with a variety of state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices, including dissemination of false or misleading advertising. While we take steps that we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always be in compliance. Compliance with these various laws and regulations could impose significant costs on our business if we fail to comply, and could result in monetary liabilities and other penalties and lead to significant negative media attention and consumer dissatisfaction, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities that, if not identified, could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible equity-based compensation, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, and taxes relating to deemed dividends resulting from foreign guarantees made by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses.\nWe are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses (NOLs) in U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Generally, for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, NOLs can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our NOLs are used or expire.\nIn addition, U.S. federal, state and local, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. In fiscal 2020, we will take a tax deduction related to a worthless stock loss in connection with the dissolution of one of our subsidiaries, Born Free Holdings Limited, however, because of the uncertainty as to whether this position may be challenged by the U.S. tax authorities, we have determined this tax benefit to be an uncertain tax position and have fully reserved for the tax benefit associated with the deduction. If there are tax benefits, including, but not limited to, the worthless stock loss deduction or our use of NOLs, or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. Our NOLs are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the NOLs were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our NOLs. If we are unable to use our NOLs or use of our NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA material impairment in the carrying value of other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nA portion of our assets are intangible, which are reviewed on an annual basis and/or whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value, resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment is determined. If we make changes in our business strategy, our future operating performance was to fall significantly below forecast levels or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results and net worth.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage our reputation, disrupt our operations and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including systems managed by third parties, across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, and various other processes and transactions, including credit card processing for online sales. In the course of our operations, we may collect and use confidential customer data and a variety of personal data. A successful cyberattack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, wire fraud and other forms of cyber fraud, the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service and social engineering fraud. Cyberattacks have become increasingly difficult to detect, and a successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including the disruption of operations and the misappropriation of confidential business information or personal data. Although we devote resources to protect our information systems, we realize that cyberattacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal, financial or reputational harm to us, or would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of personal data could result in significant liability under state, federal and international laws regarding data privacy, and may cause an adverse impact to our reputation and potentially disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. When we or our competitors announce new products, experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results, announce strategic relationships, acquisitions or dispositions, change earnings estimates, publish financial results or other material news, our stock price is often affected. The volatility of our stock price may be accentuated during periods of low volume trading, which may require a stockholder wishing to sell a large number of shares to do so in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our Company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which may not be in your best interests.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation include authorization for our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued, and to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control. Our bylaws require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, in general, imposes restrictions upon acquirers of 15% or more of our stock. Finally, the Board of Directors may in the future adopt other protective measures, such as a stockholder rights plan, which could delay, deter or prevent a change of control.", "PERMNO": 91909, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "SUMR"}
