Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral global economic and business conditions\nOur Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments are dependent on global economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by global macroeconomic trends that, in turn, affect, among other things, availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced.\nOur Architectural Glass segment's operation located in Brazil is subject to the economic, political and tax conditions prevalent in the country. We cannot predict how changing economic conditions in Brazil will impact our financial results; however, our Brazilian operation makes up less than five percent of our net sales annually.\nOur LSO segment depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.\nForeign currency exchange impacts\nOur subsidiaries in Canada and Brazil report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.\nIn addition, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors have become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products have become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted.\nNew competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors\nAll of our operating segments operate in competitive industries where the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in a loss of customers or share of customers' demand. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.\nOur Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments have seen an increase in imports of competitive products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If imports of competitive products were to occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins could be negatively impacted.\nOur LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers that have traditionally been less focused on the U.S. custom picture framing industry. Certain of these competitors have recently developed some value-added products that are able to compete more directly with some products in our existing portfolio. If these competitors are able to successfully increase their product attributes and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus to the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted.\nAcquisitions and related integration activities\nWe have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, markets and new product introductions. While we have a disciplined approach to assessing potential acquisition targets, conducting due diligence activities, and negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, there are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing business activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities, problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects underway at time of acquisition, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.\nIf one or more of these risks arises in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nEffective utilization and management of our manufacturing capacity\nNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and make additional investments in additional physical capacity could adversely affect our operating results.\nLoss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor\nOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor. Increased activity in residential and commercial construction has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers. Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that at times may experience low levels of unemployment. If we are unable to retain existing employees and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nCommodity price fluctuations and supply availability\nOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum, and we are usually eventually able to pass aluminum cost increases on to our customers, short-term operating results could be negatively impacted by sudden price movements in the market for raw aluminum.\nOur Architectural Glass segment uses raw glass as a significant input to its products. The supply of raw glass has become tighter due to several years of growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Although we have secured supply commitments from multiple suppliers that allow us to reach our near-term growth targets, a significant unplanned downtime at one or more of our key suppliers could negatively impact our operating results.\nProduct quality issues\nWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standards required by our customers. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience: additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers, with or without merit, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our financial results.\nProject management and installation issues\nThe Architectural Services segment and, occasionally, a portion of the Architectural Framing Systems segment are awarded fixed-price contracts for installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors, difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.\nChanges in architectural trends, building codes or consumer preferences\nAny change in commercial construction customer preference, architectural trends or building codes that reduce window-to-wall ratios in non-residential construction would negatively impact net sales and operating income in our architectural-related segments. The LSO segment depends on U.S. consumers framing art and other decorative items. Any shift in customer preference away from framed art to other forms of wall decor could negatively impact future net sales and operating income in the LSO segment.\nCustomer dependence in the LSO segment\nThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, and we expect this to continue in the future. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-\nadded picture framing glass or acrylic products for one of those customers, could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results.\nResults can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts\nOur sales and earnings guidance and external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Even though we have significant market intelligence through our contact with real estate developers, building owners and architects, and continually monitor micro- and macro-economic indicators of future performance of the commercial construction market, we are unable to precisely predict events that can significantly change market cycles. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would likely have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nSignificant risk retention through self-insurance programs\nWe obtain third-party insurance for potential losses from general liability, employment practices, workers' compensation and automobile liability risk, as well as medical insurance. However, a high amount of risk is retained on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nDependence on information technology systems and potential security threats\nOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems. Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results.\nAdditionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.\nUse of hazardous chemicals and environmental compliance\nWe use hazardous chemicals in the production process of some of our products. One of our facilities has certain historical environmental conditions that are in the process of being remediated. Our inability to remediate the historical environmental conditions at the facility at or below the amounts reserved could have an adverse impact on future financial results. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, compliance with which is expensive. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or increased costs.", "PERMNO": 14526, "SIC": 3442, "TIC": "APOG"}
