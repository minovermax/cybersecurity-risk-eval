of our Class A common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf\nDifficult economic conditions could harm our business.\nRisk Factors\nWe face a number of substantial risks. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, which should be considered together with the other items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Associated with Direct Selling and Our Sales Force\nChallenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding the form of our network marketing system. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by government agencies or courts can change.\nRecent settlements between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims, problematic compensation structures and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. The FTC has been active in its enforcement activities, and any adverse rulings or legal actions could impact our business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example:\n\u25cf\nIn 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims.\n\u25cf\nIn 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance.\n\u25cf\nIn 2019, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and compensation structure and inappropriate earnings claims. The company agreed to a prohibition from engaging in multi-level marketing. The FTC and another multi-level marketing company are currently in litigation, and that company had indicated the FTC was seeking to limit the levels of payment in its compensation structure as a condition to settlement.\n\u25cf\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make.\n\u25cf\nIn 2021, the FTC sent a notice to more than 1,100 companies, including us and two of our subsidiaries (Pharmanex, LLC and Big Planet, Inc.), that outlined several practices that the FTC determined to be unfair or deceptive in prior administrative cases. These practices relate to earnings claims, other money-making opportunity claims, and endorsements and testimonials. Pursuant to the FTC\u2019s \u201cpenalty offense authority,\u201d companies that received the notice are expected to comply with the standards set in the prior administrative cases and could incur significant civil penalties if they or their representatives fail to do so. The penalties could be up to $43,792 per violation, and there is some ambiguity in how a \u201cviolation\u201d would be defined for these purposes.\nAlthough we take steps to educate our Brand Affiliates on proper claims, if our Brand Affiliates make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business. In addition, if the requirements related to compensation structures in the actions listed above lead to new industry standards or new rules, or if they limit the levels in the network for which payments can be made, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail customers and preferred customers, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.\nWe could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of civil actions against other direct-selling companies in the United States, that have, and may in the future, resulted in significant settlements. Allegations directed at us and our competitors regarding the legality of multi-level marketing in various markets and adverse media reports have also created intense public scrutiny of us and our industry. Our business has also been subject to formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities in the past regarding our business and our compliance with local laws and regulations. All of these actions and any future scrutiny of us or our industry could generate negative publicity or further regulatory actions that could result in fines, restrict our ability to conduct our business in our various markets, enter into new markets, motivate our sales force and attract consumers.\nLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\nVarious government agencies throughout the world regulate direct sales practices. Laws and regulations in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Mainland China are particularly stringent and subject to broad discretion in enforcement by regulators. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d that compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets often:\n\u25cf\nimpose requirements related to sign-up, order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\u25cf\nrequire us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\u25cf\nimpose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\u25cf\nimpose reporting requirements; and\n\u25cf\nrequire that our sales force is compensated for selling products and not for recruiting others.\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and requires significant resources. The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and like other direct selling companies, we are subject from time to time to government inquiries and investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our sales compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and investigations. During 2021, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) announced that it is initiating a review of its Business Opportunity Rule, which imposes certain obligations on business opportunity sellers in their dealings with prospective buyers. Currently, multi-level marketing companies are exempted from this rule. If this exemption is eliminated or if new regulations are adopted for multi-level marketing companies, it could negatively impact the growth of our sales force and our revenue. In addition, markets where we currently do business could change their laws or regulations to prohibit direct selling. If we are unable to obtain necessary licenses and certifications within required deadlines or continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline. Any delay could negatively impact our revenue.\nImproper sales force actions could harm our business.\nSales force activities that violate applicable laws, regulations or policies, or that are alleged to do so, have, and could in the future, harmed our business and reputation and resulted in government or third-party actions against us.\nFor example, in 2014, allegations were made by various media outlets that certain of our sales representatives in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. This adverse publicity, as well as a government review and actions that we voluntarily took to address the situation, resulted in a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. Similar or more extreme actions by government agencies in Mainland China or other markets in the future could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe direct selling industry in Japan continues to experience regulatory and media scrutiny, and other direct selling companies have been suspended from sponsoring activities. Japan imposes strict requirements regarding how Brand Affiliates approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive information from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our Brand Affiliates, and we also sometimes receive warnings to reduce such complaints. Based on this information, we continually evaluate and enhance our Brand Affiliate compliance, education and training efforts in Japan. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will successfully prevent regulatory actions against us, including fines, suspensions or other sanctions, or that the company and the direct selling industry will not receive further negative media attention, all of which could harm our business.\nExcept in Mainland China, members of our sales force are not employees and act independently of us. The most significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of joining our sales force. For example:\n\u25cf\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make.\n\u25cf\nIn 2021, the FTC sent a notice to more than 1,100 companies, including us and two of our subsidiaries (Pharmanex, LLC and Big Planet, Inc.), that outlined several practices that the FTC determined to be unfair or deceptive in prior administrative cases. These practices relate to earnings claims, other money-making opportunity claims, and endorsements and testimonials. Pursuant to the FTC\u2019s \u201cpenalty offense authority,\u201d companies that received the notice are expected to comply with the standards set in the prior administrative cases and could incur significant civil penalties if they or their representatives fail to do so. The penalties could be up to $43,792 per violation, and there is some ambiguity in how a \u201cviolation\u201d would be defined for these purposes.\nWe implement strict policies and procedures to ensure our sales force complies with legal requirements. However, given the size of our sales force, we experience problems from time to time. For example, product claims made by some of our sales force in 1990 and 1991 led to a FTC investigation that resulted in our entering into a consent agreement with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. In addition, rulings by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission and by judicial authorities against us and other companies in South Korea indicate that, if our sales force engages in criminal activity, we may be held liable or penalized for failure to supervise them adequately. Our sales force may attempt to anticipate which markets we will open in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines, suspensions or other legal action if our sales force violates applicable laws and regulations, and our reputation and brand could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, as our sales force increasingly uses social media to promote our business opportunity and products, this increases the burden on us to monitor compliance of such activities. It also increases the risk that such social media content could contain problematic claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. For example, due to the borderless nature of social media, a claim that is allowed in one market may ultimately reach another market where it is not allowed.\nSocial media platforms\u2019 decisions to prohibit, block or decrease the prominence of our sales force\u2019s content could harm our business.\nSocial media platforms have, and could in the future, decided to prohibit, block or decrease the prominence of our sales force\u2019s content for any reason. For example, due to concerns with multi-level marketing, the TikTok and WhatsApp Business platforms have updated their policies to prohibit content related to multi-level marketing. In addition, Pinterest and Facebook prohibit ads that promote multi-level marketing opportunities, and Pinterest has also imposed restrictions on weight loss products, claims and photos. Our business is becoming increasingly dependent on social commerce. Additional social media platforms\u2019 adoption of similar or stricter policies could significantly hamper our sales force\u2019s ability to promote our products and attract consumers, which could cause our revenue to decline. Our reputation could also be harmed if our sales force violates any social media platform\u2019s policies.\nIf our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable local regulations regarding foreigners, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation of foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies. If our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could result in adverse publicity and significantly harm our business.\nOur sales compensation plans or other incentives could be viewed negatively by some of our sales force, could fail to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative impact on revenue.\nOur sales compensation includes some components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our sales compensation from time to time to keep our sales compensation plans and business models competitive and attractive to our existing sales force and people interested in joining our sales force, to address changing market dynamics, to provide incentives to our sales force that we believe will help grow our business, to conform to local regulations and to address other business needs. Because of the size of our sales force and the complexity of our sales compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how such changes will be viewed by our sales force and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. It also is difficult to predict how such changes may impact our ability to attract a larger potential target market of opportunity seekers. Certain changes we have made to our global sales compensation plan in the past, which were successful in several markets, did not achieve anticipated results in certain other markets, were not viewed positively by some segments of our sales force, and negatively impacted our business. Similarly, we face the risk that we could fail to make changes to our compensation plans that would be necessary to keep our compensation competitive with the market and allow us to attract new opportunity seekers or segments of opportunity seekers, which could have a negative impact on our sales force.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea and Vietnam, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Changes to reduce sales compensation have had a negative impact on the sales force in the past and could in the future.\nWe have announced that we will be making some changes to our compensation plan in the United States to limit the amount of volume from internal sales to our sales force that can be used in the calculation of their compensation and performance measurements. To facilitate these changes, we are working to implement digital tools to allow our sales force to more easily document resales and also to encourage a shift in behavior through incentives and recognition. To the extent these proposed changes are more difficult to implement and transition than anticipated, our sales force could be distracted or have their commission impacted, all of which could negatively impact our business.\nLimits on the amount of sales compensation we pay could inhibit our ability to attract and retain our sales force, negatively impact our revenue and cause regulatory risks.\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total value of goods or services supplied in South Korea. These regulations may limit the incentive for people to join our sales force and may reduce our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in attracting and retaining our sales force.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Because sales compensation, as a percentage of revenue, can fluctuate as sales force productivity fluctuates, we may be required to make further changes to stay within applicable sales compensation limits or may be at risk of exceeding them. In addition, which revenues and expenses are within the scope of these regulations is not always clear, and interpretation and enforcement of these laws are subject to change, which could require us to make further changes or result in non-compliance with these regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam or any other market that imposes a sales compensation limit could result in fines or other sanctions, including suspensions.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our sales force, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security, withholding or other taxes with respect to payments to our sales force. This would occur if a jurisdiction classifies our sales force as our employees rather than as independent contractors, or if a jurisdiction expands the categories of personnel to whom these tax obligations apply. Some jurisdictions have begun taking these positions with respect to the distributors of direct selling companies, and they may continue to do so. For example, some jurisdictions have, without challenging the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status, taken the position that direct sellers must nonetheless pay certain taxes with respect to payments to their sales force.\nIn addition, authorities in some jurisdictions have challenged the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of distributors of some multi-level marketing companies. In the event that local laws and regulations, or the interpretation of local laws and regulations, change to require us to treat members of our sales force as employees rather than independent contractors, or that our Brand Affiliates are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including social security, withholding and related taxes, minimum wage laws, and any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. This risk increases as our sales force increases its use of social sharing, as several jurisdictions\u2019 regulations protect in-person or in-home sales demonstrations from creating an employment relationship but are less protective of online demonstrations. If our Brand Affiliates were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors, we would also face the risk of increased liability for their actions.\nRisks Associated with Our Operations in Mainland China\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government scrutiny, and we could be subject to fines or other penalties.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. The legal system in Mainland China provides government authorities broad latitude to conduct investigations, and many Chinese regulations, including those governing our business, are subject to significant interpretation, which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Because of significant government concerns in Mainland China regarding improper direct selling activities, government regulators closely scrutinize activities of direct selling companies and activities that resemble direct selling. The government in Mainland China continues to inspect and review companies in the direct selling industry on a regular basis, which has and may continue to increase regulatory scrutiny of the industry and our business.\nThe government\u2019s scrutiny of activities within the health products and direct selling industries has been at higher levels since 2019, when the government conducted a 100-day campaign to review and inspect the health products and direct selling industries following negative media coverage generated by the healthcare-related product claims made by another direct selling company in Mainland China. Since 2019, we have been receiving and addressing an increased number of government reviews, inspections, and inquiries and consumer complaints in Mainland China; our ability to hold certain business meetings has been limited; and negative media coverage has spread to include additional companies, including ours.\nGovernment regulators frequently make inquiries into our business activities and investigate complaints from consumers and others regarding our business. Some of these inquiries and investigations in the past have resulted in the payment of fines by us or members of our sales force, interruption of sales activities at stores and warnings. Any determination by government regulators in these inquiries or investigations that our operations or activities, or the activities of our sales force, are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, and termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling and other licenses, all of which could harm our business.\nWe train our sales force in Mainland China on how our Mainland China business model differs from our global business model. However, Sales Leaders in Mainland China may attend regional and global events or interact with Sales Leaders from other markets. Although our global model and Mainland China business model differ, mistakes may be made as to how those working in Mainland China should promote the business in Mainland China. These mistakes by our sales force, or allegations of such mistakes, have, and may in the future, led to government reviews and investigations of our operations in Mainland China, as well as adverse publicity, reputational harm and adjustments or interruptions to our operations, all of which has and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region.\nIf direct selling regulations in Mainland China are modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to our business model or the imposition of a range of potential penalties, our business could be significantly negatively impacted.\nThe government of Mainland China has adopted direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that impose significant restrictions and limitations on businesses in our industry. Most notably, the regulations prohibit multi-level compensation, which is the basis of how we compensate our sales force outside of Mainland China. The regulations also prohibit overseas personnel from participating in direct selling in Mainland China. We have structured our business model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations. In Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; independent\ndirect sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have a direct selling license and a service center and can also sell through our website; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We generally compensate our Sales Leaders at a level that is competitive with other direct selling companies in the market and comparable to the compensation of our Sales Leaders globally.\nOther than our direct selling subsidiary, we also have a separate subsidiary in Mainland China that is a registered independent entity that engages in cross-border e-commerce, through which we can sell a limited selection of products to consumers for their personal consumption. Cross-border e-commerce is not a permitted sales channel for direct selling in Mainland China. Members of our sales force can contract with this entity, promote products on its behalf and receive compensation. Through this entity, we sell our ageLOC Meta product, which is not currently registered in Mainland China and, therefore, can only be sold to consumers for their personal consumption. Although we take measures (1) to maintain legal separation between our cross-border e-commerce entity and our direct selling entity; and (2) to ensure the products sold on our cross-border e-commerce platform are for consumers\u2019 personal consumption only, our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if regulatory authorities elect to attribute these cross-border e-commerce sales activities and related product claims, or the accompanying actions of our sales force, to our direct selling business, and make a determination they are in violation of direct selling or other applicable laws.\nThe nature of the political, regulatory and legal systems in Mainland China gives regulatory agencies at both the local and central levels of government broad discretion to interpret and enforce regulations as they deem appropriate to promote social stability. We face a risk that regulators may change the way in which they currently interpret and enforce the direct selling regulations, or that such regulations may be modified. If our business practices are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, in particular our use of the sales productivity of a Sales Leader him/herself and of the sales force that such Sales Leader trains, collaborates with, supports and services in setting his/her salary or service fee and determining their position/title on a quarterly basis, then we could be sanctioned, required to change our business model, and/or have our direct selling license revoked, any of which could significantly harm our business.\nIn January 2019, the Mainland China government announced a 100-day campaign to review and inspect the health products and direct selling industries. This campaign involved a number of regulatory agencies. Although the 100-day period has ended, there has continued to be a heightened level of regulatory scrutiny of these industries and of our business and products. For example, government authorities have not been issuing new licenses for direct selling since the beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019. There is also uncertainty whether any changes to the regulations that apply to these industries will be made based on the review. If changes are made to any of the regulations that apply to our business model, products or operations, our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to expand our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain additional necessary national and local government approvals in Mainland China.\nTo expand our direct selling model into additional provinces in Mainland China, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from district, city, provincial and national government agencies with respect to each province in which we wish to expand. Government authorities have not been issuing new licenses since the beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019. When the process for obtaining government approvals to conduct direct selling is operational, it often evolves and is lengthy, as we are required to work with a large number of provincial, city, district and national government authorities. The complexity of the approval process as well as the government\u2019s continued cautious approach as direct selling develops in Mainland China makes it difficult to predict the timeline for obtaining these approvals. Furthermore, any media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China could increase the time and difficulty we may face in obtaining additional licenses. If media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China results in significant delays in obtaining licenses elsewhere in Mainland China, or if the current processes for obtaining approvals are delayed further for any reason or are changed or interpreted differently than currently understood, our ability to receive direct selling licenses in Mainland China and our growth prospects in this market could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, our business could be harmed.\nWe face lengthy timelines with respect to product registrations in Mainland China. The process for obtaining product permits and licenses may require extended periods of time that may prevent us from launching new product initiatives in Mainland China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in Mainland China as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and with a few exceptions, the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. If the recent media and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry results in more burdensome regulations related to product registration, we may have more difficulty getting new wellness products registered for sale in Mainland China. We market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, we could be prohibited or limited in marketing such products in Mainland China in their current form.\nAs we expand our direct selling channel, we face additional product marketing restrictions compared to our retail store channel. Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, we can only register products for direct selling if we manufacture them and if they fall within categories that are authorized for direct selling, such as cosmetics, cleaning supplies, health foods, healthcare devices, small kitchen utensils and household appliances. Products that are not categorized as direct selling products and products that are manufactured by third parties are prohibited from being marketed or sold through our direct sales channel, and the process for registering products for the direct sales channel in Mainland China is subject to delays. If we cannot successfully manufacture our own direct selling products, we will not be able to sell these products through the direct sales channel. Any marketing or sale of non-direct selling products by our independent direct sellers could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us, including if a product is initially classified as a direct selling product but is later re-classified.\nRisks Associated with Market Conditions and Competition\nOur markets are intensely competitive, and market conditions and the strengths of competitors may harm our business.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. The success of our products is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences and to maintain a product offering and pipeline that is relevant and priced accessibly to consumers. Many competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we have, which may give them a competitive advantage. For example, our Nu Skin products compete directly with branded, premium retail products and with the products of other direct selling companies. Because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of beauty and wellness products, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 products, and competing products entering the beauty and wellness market could harm our revenue. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately adapt to trends in consumer behavior and technologies to meet consumers\u2019 needs and demands and reach a wider audience.\nWe also compete with other direct selling companies and gig economy companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors have also adopted and could continue to adopt some of our successful business strategies, including our global sales compensation plan. Consequently, to successfully compete in this industry, and attract and retain our sales force and consumers, we must ensure that our business opportunities and sales compensation plans are financially rewarding and innovative. Although we believe we have significant competitive advantages, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete in this industry.\nAdverse publicity concerning our business, marketing plan, products or people could harm our business and reputation.\nGrowth in our sales force and consumers and our results of operations can be particularly impacted by adverse publicity. Given the nature of our operations, lack of clarity on applicable legal requirements and standards, and our continuous need to recruit and retain consumers and members of our sales force, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse publicity. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse publicity concerning:\n\u25cf\nsuspicions about the legality and ethics of network marketing;\n\u25cf\nmedia or regulatory scrutiny regarding our business and our business models, including in Mainland China;\n\u25cf\nthe safety or effectiveness of our or our competitors\u2019 products or the ingredients in such products;\n\u25cf\ninquiries, investigations, fines, legal actions, or mandatory or voluntary product recalls involving us, our competitors, our business models or our respective products;\n\u25cf\nthe actions of our current or former sales force and employees, including any allegations that our sales force or employees have overstated or made false product claims or earnings representations, or engaged in unethical or illegal activity;\n\u25cf\nmisperceptions about the types and magnitude of economic benefits offered at different levels of sales engagement in our business; and\n\u25cf\npublic, governmental or media perceptions of the direct selling, beauty product, or wellness product industries generally.\nThese issues have previously resulted in negative publicity and have harmed our business.\nCritics of our industry, consumer protection groups, short sellers and other individuals have in the past and may in the future utilize the internet, the press and other means to publish criticisms of the industry, our company and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. In some cases, such adverse publicity or allegations can lead to government and regulatory scrutiny. We continue to see adverse publicity regarding our company and the direct selling and healthcare products industries. We or others in our industry may receive similar negative publicity or allegations in the future, and it may harm our business and reputation. Furthermore, the availability of social media channels can increase the likelihood of negative publicity because these channels are an easily accessible public forum. For example, if a member of our sales force makes an improper claim about our products or business opportunity on social media, or if a critic of our company posts negative information about our company on social media, it is more likely to be disseminated widely and potentially noticed by the media or regulators.\nInability of products, platforms, business opportunities and other initiatives to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance could harm our business.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to proactively anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences regarding products, platforms and business opportunities. Our operating results could be adversely affected if our products, platforms, business opportunities and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic benefit to retain our existing consumers and sales force or to attract new consumers and sales force members. Potential factors affecting the attractiveness of our products, platforms, business opportunities and other initiatives include, among other things, shifting consumer demands, perceived product quality and value, product exclusivity or effectiveness, demographic trends, the strength of our brand and public image, sustainability factors, DEI initiatives, economic success in our business opportunity, the quality and accuracy of the data we use in running our business, our technology infrastructure and capabilities, restrictions in social or digital media for sharing products and attracting consumers, adverse media attention or regulatory restrictions on claims. If we are unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if we are unable to anticipate changes in the gig and sharing economies and adapt our business opportunity accordingly, our ability to capture growth trends in the social commerce marketplace could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to develop and introduce new products could be impacted by, among other things, government regulations, changing policies in social media and other communications platforms, the inability to attract and retain qualified staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, intellectual property of competitors that may limit our ability to offer innovative products or that challenge our own intellectual property, problems related to manufacturing or quality control, and difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if our products fail to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance or if our successful new products undercut the sales of our other products.\nTo adapt our business to current macroeconomic trends, we are currently working through a significant digital transformation in our business to achieve widespread adoption of social commerce in all of our markets. This transformation involves the development of new and enhanced digital tools for our Sales Leaders and consumers, including new digital apps and an improved website design and functionality, as well as new products, including connected devices. Our digital transformation will require significant expenditures over the next several years. We also face the risk that we will ultimately be unable to develop these items, that their development will be more costly than anticipated, or that the tools and products we develop will not meet the expectations of our sales force and/or consumers. Any of these eventualities could have a material negative impact on our business, sales force, consumer development and revenue.\nIn addition, in our more mature markets, one of the challenges we face is keeping Sales Leaders with established businesses and high-income levels motivated and actively engaged in business building activities and in developing new Sales Leaders. We may also face challenges retaining our sales force as the population of our markets transitions to a younger, millennial/Gen Z demographic, with its associated new and different dynamics of connection through social media platforms, gratification and loyalty behaviors, particularly as this segment becomes a greater share of our revenue. Moreover, if sales through social sharing do not generate repeat purchases or subscriptions at the same rate as other sales, this could create revenue volatility. Many in the younger demographic are particularly savvy with social sharing across multiple business opportunity platforms. There can be no assurance that our initiatives will generate lasting excitement and engagement among our sales force in the long term or that planned initiatives will be successful in maintaining sales force activity and productivity or in motivating Sales Leaders to remain engaged in business building and developing new Sales Leaders. Some initiatives may have unanticipated negative impacts on our sales force, particularly changes to our sales compensation plans. The introduction of a new product or key initiative can also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our Sales Leaders focus their efforts on the new product or initiative. In addition, if any of our products fails to gain acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns.\nProduct diversion may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe see our products being sold through online marketplace sites and other distribution channels in certain markets. Although we continually take steps to control product diversion, including products sold in Mainland China, this activity continues to be a challenge, and we believe that changes to our global sales compensation plan or increased use of online channels for conducting sales transactions have and may continue to lead to increased product diversion. Product diversion causes confusion regarding our distribution channels and negatively impacts the ability of our sales force to sell our products. It also creates a negative impression regarding the viability of the business opportunity for our sales force, which can harm our ability to recruit new people to join our sales force. Product diversion may also cause brand erosion and negatively impact the brand value perception. Product diversion schemes may also involve illegal importation, investment or other activities and harm our brand if gray market or counterfeit goods are passed off as our own. If we are unable to effectively address this issue or if diversion increases, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Associated with COVID-19\nEpidemics, including COVID-19, and other crises have and may continue to negatively impact our business.\nDue to the person-to-person nature of direct selling, our results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, harmed if the fear of a communicable and rapidly spreading disease or other crises such as natural disasters result in travel restrictions or cause people to avoid group meetings or gatherings or interaction with other people. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises. The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and ensuing pandemic resulted in significant contraction of economies around the world and interrupted global supply chains as many governments issued stay-at-home orders to combat COVID-19. Government-imposed restrictions and public hesitance regarding in-person gatherings, travel and visiting public places have reduced our sales force\u2019s ability to hold sales meetings, resulted in cancellations of key sales leader events and incentive trips, and required us to temporarily close our walk-in and fulfillment locations in some markets where we have such properties. The outbreak has also impacted our ability to obtain some ingredients and packaging as well as ship products in some markets. Our supply chain and logistics have incurred some interruptions and cost impacts to date, and we could experience more significant interruptions and cost impacts or face more significant closures in the future, whether due to COVID-19 directly, workforce (including the workforce of our supply chain) resistance to vaccination requirements, or other related factors. These factors and other events related to COVID-19 have negatively impacted our sales and operations and will likely continue to negatively affect our business and our financial results. Although some of the negative impacts of COVID-19 have recently improved, this situation continues to be fluid and there is uncertainty regarding its duration and future impacts. For example, COVID-19 variants have caused some of the pandemic\u2019s negative impacts to worsen or return. In addition, the productivity of our sales force has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted as restrictions are lifted and our sales force is able to more freely travel and take vacations.\nAny significant decline in our operating results in the future could also adversely affect our financial position and liquidity. Under the terms of our existing credit facility, we are required to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and related term loan impose debt service and amortization requirements. A significant deterioration in our results of operations in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our ability to comply with our financial covenants and debt service and amortization obligations, which could result in an event of default under the terms of our credit facility. An event of default under our credit facility could result in an inability to access funding under the agreement and the acceleration of our obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities closely scrutinize the product- and earnings-related claims made by direct-selling companies and their sales force, including claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, during 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make. Although we take steps to educate our Brand Affiliates on proper claims, if our Brand Affiliates make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business and reputation.\nInternational Risks\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations, including:\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that a government might ban or severely restrict our sales compensation and business models;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that local civil unrest, political instability, or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in one or more markets;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u25cf\nthe presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax, customs, or other financial burdens on us or our sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash.\nThere has been an increasing level of tension in U.S.-China relations over the last few years. Given the significant size of our China business, our business could be harmed if relations continue to deteriorate or additional sanctions or restrictions are imposed by either government. In addition, there have been adverse public reaction and media attention to statements made by representatives of other businesses related to these issues that have adversely affected business. We could similarly face adverse public or media attention, and potentially increased regulatory scrutiny, as a result of increased trade or political tensions or any statements or actions by employees or our sales force that generate publicity with respect to these issues.\nWe are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, currency controls and inflation in foreign markets, all of which could impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn 2021, approximately 80% of our sales occurred in markets outside of the United States in each market\u2019s respective local currency. Foreign-currency fluctuations affect our financial position and results of operations. We purchase inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenue and expenses in our markets outside the United States from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, our reported revenue, gross profit and net income will likely be reduced. Foreign-currency fluctuations also cause losses and gains resulting from translation of foreign-currency-denominated balances on our balance sheet.\nWe also face the risk of currency controls. If foreign governments restrict transfers of cash out of their country and control exchange rates, we may be limited as to the timing and amount of cash we can repatriate and may not be able to repatriate cash at beneficial exchange rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the United States through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of intangible property, and corporate services. However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends. For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the form of dividends until we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period. We also have experienced delays in repatriating cash from Argentina. As of December 31, 2021, we had $50.3 million in cash denominated in Chinese RMB, and our intercompany receivable with our Argentina subsidiary was $11.3 million.\nIn addition, high levels of inflation and currency devaluations in any of our markets could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in our net earnings. For example, during 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; accordingly, beginning with the third quarter of 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentina operations, which has resulted in additional foreign-currency charges. Other markets may be designated as highly inflationary economies in the future, which could result in further foreign-currency charges.\nAlthough we may engage in transactions intended to reduce our exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be effective. Complex global political and economic dynamics can affect exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures related to the level of trade between the United States and other markets could impact the value of the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict future fluctuations and the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results or our overall financial condition.\nPotential changes to tariff and import/export regulations, and ongoing trade disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\nThe United States and other foreign jurisdictions may change customs regulations or tariff rates that are applied to our imports or exports at any time. Tariff changes are difficult to predict and may cause us material short-term or long-term cost fluctuations. We rely on the use of Free Trade Agreements that may experience alterations, suspensions or cancellations, which could increase our customs expense or otherwise harm our business. In addition to tariffs, any actions taken by the United States or by foreign countries to further implement trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory scrutiny, or other actions that impact our ability to obtain necessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business. These actions are unpredictable, and any of them could also have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, significantly reduce global trade, restrict our access to suppliers or customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIf we are unable to retain our existing sales force and recruit additional people to join our sales force, our revenue may not increase and may even decline.\nOur products are primarily marketed by our sales force, and we depend on them to generate virtually all of our revenue. Our sales force may terminate their services at any time, and like most direct selling companies, we experience high turnover among our sales force from year to year. People who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short-term income goals frequently only stay with us for a short time. Sales Leaders who have committed time and effort to build a sales organization will generally stay for longer periods. To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of and/or the productivity of our sales force. We must also expand our outreach and outbound efforts to attract, connect and nurture new customers for a wider consumer base who purchase product and whom we can foster along a consumer journey to promote retention and higher lifetime value.\nWe have experienced periodic fluctuations in both Sales Leaders and Customers in the past and could experience such fluctuations again in the future. For example, our Sales Leaders in Mainland China declined 46% from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 due to such factors as meeting restrictions and negative media scrutiny. Our ability to retain our Sales Leaders and Customers could be affected as our sales force makes increased use of social sharing channels, which may allow them to more easily engage their consumers and sales network in other opportunities. If our initiatives do not drive growth in both Sales Leaders and Customers, our operating results could be harmed. While we take many steps to help train, motivate and retain our sales force, we cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our sales force may fluctuate because we rely primarily upon our Sales Leaders to find new consumers and to find, train and develop new Sales Leaders. Our operating results could be harmed if we and our Sales Leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business and its products to retain and motivate our existing sales force and attract new people to join our sales force.\nThe number and productivity of our sales force is negatively impacted by several additional factors, including:\n\u25cf\nany adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding us, our products or ingredients, our distribution channel, or our industry or competitors;\n\u25cf\nlack of interest in, dissatisfaction with, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n\u25cf\nlack of compelling products or income opportunities, including through our sales compensation plans and incentive trips and other offerings;\n\u25cf\nnegative sales force reaction to changes in our sales compensation plans or to our failure to make changes that would be necessary to keep our compensation competitive with the market;\n\u25cf\ninteractions with our company, including our actions to enforce our policies and procedures and the quality of our customer service;\n\u25cf\nany regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry, as well as regulatory changes that impact product formulations and sales viability;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, business and public health conditions, including employment levels, employment trends such as the gig and sharing economies, and pandemics or other conditions that curtail person-to-person interactions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the policies of social media platforms used to prospect or recruit potential consumers and sales force participants;\n\u25cf\nrecruiting efforts of our competitors and changes in consumer-loyalty trends; and\n\u25cf\npotential saturation or maturity levels in a given market, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our sales force in such market.\nWe depend on our key personnel and Sales Leaders, and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers, other key employees or key Sales Leaders could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior and regional management, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our senior and regional management employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time, and it is not uncommon for employees of direct-selling companies, including employees of our company, to terminate their employment and begin working for another direct-selling company. In addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth in our markets. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel has been an increased challenge during the current competitive employment environment. If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nThe success of our business also depends on our key Sales Leaders. As of December 31, 2021, we had a global network of 1,367,559 Customers. Approximately 61,515 of our Customers were Sales Leaders. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 456 Sales Leaders occupied the highest levels under our global sales compensation plan, and in Mainland China we have approximately 184 key Sales Leaders who play a significant role in managing, training and servicing our sales force in that market and driving sales. We rely on these Sales Leaders (or other sales force members that they train, collaborate with, support and service) for a substantial majority of our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level or key Sales Leader or a group of leading Sales Leaders, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our growth and our revenue.\nRisks Associated with Our Manufacturing and Operations\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting, shortages in ingredients, and reliance on our suppliers could harm our business.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and our reliance on third-party suppliers to manufacture and deliver products that meet our specifications in a timely manner could harm our business. Occasionally, we have experienced production difficulties with respect to our products, including the availability of labor, raw materials, components, packaging and products that do not meet our specifications and quality control standards. These production difficulties and quality problems have in the past, and could in the future, result in stock outages or shortages in our markets with respect to such products, harm our sales, or create inventory write-downs for unusable products.\nIn addition, we and our supply chain acquire ingredients, components, products and packaging from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. A loss of any of these suppliers and any difficulties in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers could harm our business. In addition, we obtain some of our products and ingredients from sole suppliers that own or control the product formulations, ingredients or other intellectual property rights associated with such products. We also license the right to distribute some of our products from third parties. In the event we are unable to maintain or renew our contracts with any of these suppliers, manufacturers or other third parties, we may need to discontinue some products or develop substitute products, which could harm our revenue. In addition, if we experience supply shortages, price increases or regulatory impediments with respect to the raw materials, ingredients, components or packaging we use for our products, we may need to seek alternative supplies or suppliers and may experience difficulties in finding replacements that are comparable in quality and price. For example, some of our wellness products, including g3 juice, ReishiMax, ageLOC Meta and ageLOC Youth (Youthspan or Y-Span in some markets), incorporate unique natural ingredients that are only harvested once per year and/or may have limited global supplies. If demand exceeds forecasts, we may have difficulties in obtaining additional supplies to meet the excess demand until the next growing season. If we are unable to successfully respond to such issues, our business could be harmed.\nThe loss of or a disruption in our manufacturing, supply chain and distribution operations, or significant expenses or violations incurred by such operations, could adversely affect our business.\nAs a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution, and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, climate or environmental events, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor shortages, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, import and export restrictions or delays, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, global uncertainties, acts of terrorism and other external or macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. These risks may be heightened if we consolidate certain of our manufacturing, distribution or supply facilities or if we are unable to successfully enhance our disaster recovery planning. These risks also increase as we pursue our current strategy of acquiring manufacturing companies and thereby conducting more of our manufacturing in-house. The loss of, or disruption or damage to, any of our facilities or centers or those of our third-party manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to the transportation channels used in our supply chain and distribution operations, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of air freight to meet demand. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in several disruptions and delays, as well as quantity limits and price increases, in our global transportation channels.\nIn addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous regulations, including labor regulations and environmental regulations that govern the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals and other materials. We will also likely become subject to new regulations in these areas, which could require substantial expenditures. Violations of existing or new requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions or private-party actions that might be initiated against us, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to execute our product launch process or ongoing product sales due to difficulty in forecasting or increased pressure on our supply chain, information systems and management.\nPrior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we typically do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product introduction or promotion. These offerings sometimes generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which results in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. These offerings may also increase our product return rate. We have, and may in the future, experienced difficulty effectively managing growth associated with these offerings and may face increased risk of improper sales force activities and related government scrutiny.\nIn addition, the size and condensed schedule of these product offerings increase pressure on our supply chain and order processing systems. We have, and may in the future, failed to appropriately scale our system capacity and operations in response to unanticipated changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products, which reduces our sales force\u2019s confidence in our business and could harm our reputation and profitability.\nAs our sales force increases its use of social platforms to interact with customers, our business results could be adversely affected if our implementation of new platforms and processes to support our sales force is delayed. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for testing and delivery of portions of these and other of our information system platforms. Unanticipated changes or system failures by third parties could harm our ability to meet the expectations of our sales force, thus resulting in harm to our revenue, reputation and sales force confidence in our systems.\nIf we do not accurately forecast sales levels in each market for product launches or ongoing product sales, obtain sufficient ingredients, components or packaging, or produce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our sales force and consumers. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations for a product launch or ongoing product sales or if we change our planned launch strategies or initiatives, we could incur inventory write-downs. Each of these issues has impacted us in the past, and they could again occur with our ongoing product launches. If we fail to effectively forecast product demand in the product launch process or for ongoing product sales, our reputation and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth in certain markets, our operations could be harmed.\nAt times, we can experience significant growth in one or more of our markets. For example, during 2020 we experienced significant growth in some of the markets in our Americas and EMEA segments. Growth can strain our ability to effectively manage our operations, as it requires us to expand our management team, labor force, technology bandwidth and capabilities, and manufacturing operations. Insufficient management execution to support growth could result in, among other things, product delays or shortages, decreases in product quality, service level challenges, operating mistakes and errors, inadequate customer service, inappropriate claims or promotions by our sales force, and governmental inquires and investigations, all of which could harm our revenue and ability to generate sustained growth and result in unanticipated expenses. In addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth. If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nSystem failures, capacity constraints and other information technology difficulties could harm our business.\nWith global operations and a complex sales compensation plan, our business is highly dependent on efficiently functioning information technology systems, including websites, mobile applications, cloud providers, data centers, databases, networks and other systems. We rely on these systems for accepting and processing sales orders, operating our sales force and customer support operations, tracking and compensating our sales force, conducting our corporate and regional operations, preparing our financial statements, and other aspects of our business. Accordingly, the performance, reliability and availability of our systems are critical to our business, reputation, financial reporting, and ability to attract and retain our sales force and customers.\nOur systems may be damaged or disrupted by fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, human error, telecommunications failures, power loss, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, cyber attacks, changes in our information technology systems or organization, and other events. We have, and may in the future, experienced system failures and outages. We cannot guarantee that the preventive measures we take, including redundancies, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent or remedy system failure or interruption, data loss, security breaches or other data security incidents. Furthermore, any mitigation process could take several days or more, thus resulting in a loss of revenue, loss of confidence of our sales force and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, we make significant expenditures on our information technology infrastructure and other technology initiatives, and these items could become obsolete or impaired, which has and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenses to address. For example, in 2018, following an evaluation of our information technology infrastructure and organization and our social sharing and digital initiatives, we determined to alter our strategic direction with respect to some of our systems and tools, resulting in impairment charges of approximately $49 million. We also incurred approximately $22 million in severance payments and other expenses related to the reorganization of our Information Technology Department and other corporate and regional offices. Additional cash outlay and new personnel were also necessary for execution of new plans and strategy. In this strategic shift in direction, we continue to identify and re-architect additional legacy systems to help mitigate the risk and exposure these systems introduce to our business. We also continue to allocate resources to new technology and digital initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to build and roll-out our new technology and digital tools on a global scale or that they will function as intended, and these initiatives may entail significant expenses and could cause disruptions in our business.\nOur systems could also be strained by growth in our business. Although we work to expand and enhance our ecommerce features, network infrastructure and other technologies to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic to our ecommerce channels, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Our failure, or our suppliers\u2019 failure, to achieve or maintain system capacity could significantly reduce our ability to fulfill orders and could harm our business, reputation, revenue and financial condition.\nAny acquired companies or future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.\nWe have acquired certain businesses, and we plan to continue to do so in the future as we encounter acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and/or negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments, not all of which will be consummated. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience. The financing for any of these acquisitions could dilute the interests of our stockholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Our past acquisitions have, and future acquisitions could, entailed numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating acquired operations or products;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulties of imposing financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential costs of doing so;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, suppliers or distributors from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nincreased fixed costs;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term;\n\u25cf\nthe assumption of unexpected liabilities, including litigation risks;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with our suppliers, sales force or consumers; and\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with entering markets or industries in which we have limited or no prior experience, including limited expertise in running the business, developing the technology, and selling and servicing the products.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, or a failure to adjust our fixed costs quickly enough or sufficiently to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. It is also possible that our acquired companies could sell products or utilize a business model similar to that of our Nu Skin business, which could be viewed negatively by our sales force and result in a reduction in our revenue.\nProduct Legal and Regulatory Risks\nRegulations governing our products, including the formulation, registration, pre-approval, marketing and sale of our products, could harm our business.\nOur products are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous federal, state and local government agencies and authorities. Many of these laws and regulations involve a high level of subjectivity, are subject to interpretation, and vary significantly from market to market. These laws and regulations can, and often do, have several impacts on our business, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndelays, or altogether prohibitions, in introducing or selling a product or ingredient in one or more markets;\n\u25cf\ndelays and expenses associated with the registration and approval process for a product;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our ability to import products into a market;\n\u25cf\ndelays and expenses associated with compliance, such as record keeping, documentation of the properties of certain products, labeling, and scientific substantiation;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the claims we can make regarding our products; and\n\u25cf\nproduct reformulations, or the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated to comply with new regulations.\nWe have observed a general increase in regulatory activity and activism in the United States and across many markets globally where we operate, and the regulatory landscape is becoming more complex with increasingly strict requirements. In particular, the requirements are impacting the ingredients we can include in our products, the accepted quantities of those ingredients and the quality and characterization of the ingredients. Global regulators have in recent years become overall more restrictive on the accepted levels of active ingredients that we can use in our product, in some cases banning them outright. They have also become more restrictive on permitted contaminant levels in ingredients and, in many cases, have forced complete removal of such contaminants. In certain cases, such as regarding some pesticides which are virtually ubiquitous in nature, it has proven difficult to comply with the requirements. Further, many of the restrictions regarding ingredient quality are not directly applicable to our products, leaving the possibility that our interpretation of compliance may not match that of the enforcing authorities. Often there is a lack of an equivalent active ingredient present in the marketplace. In other cases, the removal or reduction of a technical ingredient, such as various types of parabens, leads to a significant change to the character of the product that may make it no longer desirable or safe to the consumer. If this trend in new regulations continues, we may find it necessary to alter some of the ways we have traditionally marketed our products in order to stay in compliance with a changing regulatory landscape and this could add to the costs of our operations and/or have an adverse impact on our business.\nMany laws and regulations govern the registration, pre-market approval or other aspects of regulatory oversight of our products. For example, in the United States, some legislators and industry critics have pushed for years to increase regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. In 2011, the FDA proposed draft guidance to clarify the FDA\u2019s interpretation of the dietary ingredient notification requirements, and in 2016, the FDA issued a revised draft guidance that superseded the 2011 version. This draft guidance is not yet final but appears to indicate that the FDA is expanding its definition of what is considered a \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d in the United States. The industry has worked with the FDA for several years, providing comments to the FDA to modify this guidance. While still in flux, if enacted in final form as proposed, this guidance could impose new and significant regulatory barriers for our nutritional supplement products or unique ingredients, which could delay or inhibit our ability to formulate, introduce and sell nutritional supplements as we have in the past. We face similar pressures in our other markets, which continue to set restrictions on ingredients and their acceptable maximum levels, as well as on ingredient characterization, quality and levels. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that were not marketed in Europe prior to May 1997 (\u201cnovel foods\u201d) without going through an extensive registration and pre-market approval process.\nThe FDA currently does not have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics. However, cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales.\nOur operations could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our products or impose additional burdens or requirements on us in order to continue selling our products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. If new or existing laws and regulations restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to introduce or market our products or limit the claims we are able to make regarding our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations governing our products, we could face enforcement action, and we could be fined or forced to alter or stop selling our products.\nGovernment regulations and private party actions relating to the marketing and advertising of our products and services may restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to sell our products and harm our business.\nGovernment authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts that we undertake to support our claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If we are unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for our product claims, or if our marketing materials or the marketing materials of our sales force make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, cosmetics or devices that we offer, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, which could harm our business.\nFor example, in recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and our research and development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nIn the United States, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (\u201cGuides\u201d) require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing, and they generally do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our sales force has historically used testimonials and \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos to market and sell some of our popular products such as our ageLOC Spa systems and ageLOC Transformation anti-aging skin care system. We intend to continue to use testimonials for our popular products, including weight management products and beauty products. In highly regulated and scrutinized product categories such as weight management, if we or our sales force fails to comply with the Guides or makes improper product claims, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our marketing materials.\nOur operations could be harmed if we fail to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices.\nAcross our markets, there are regulations on a diverse range of Good Manufacturing Practices that apply to us and to our vendors covering product categories such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, foods, over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. The Good Manufacturing Practices impose stringent requirements on a variety of topics, including vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. Ingredient identification requirements, which often require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us because our products contain many different ingredients. Additionally, certain Good Manufacturing Practices obligate us to track and periodically report adverse events to government agencies. Compliance with these increasing regulations may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance. In addition, our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities determine that we or our vendors are not in compliance with these regulations or if public reporting of adverse events harms our reputation for quality and safety. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products, including public withdrawals, seizures and recalls. For example, in prior years, we have had product recalls in the United States based on labeling issues. Problems associated with product recalls could be exacerbated due to the global nature of our business because a recall in one jurisdiction could lead to recalls in other jurisdictions. In addition, these risks associated with noncompliance could increase as we acquire businesses, including the businesses in our Rhyz strategic investment arm and any businesses we may acquire in the future.\nIf our current or any future device products are determined to be medical devices in a particular geographic market, or if our sales force uses these products for medical purposes or makes improper medical claims, our ability to continue to market and distribute such devices could be harmed, and we could face legal or regulatory actions.\nOne of our strategies is to market unique and innovative products that allow our sales force to distinguish our products, including our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Boost. Any determination by regulatory authorities in our markets that these products or any future devices must receive clearance or be registered as medical devices could restrict our ability to import or sell the product in such market until registration is obtained. While we have not been required to register our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa or ageLOC Boost as medical devices in most of our markets, we have registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand, Peru and Colombia. In addition, we have received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use. We have registered ageLOC Boost as a medical device in Thailand, and we intend to do so in the United States as well. There have been legislative proposals in the Philippines relating to the regulation of medical devices that could affect the way we market our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Boost in this market. In addition, if our sales force attempts to import or export products from one market to another in violation of our policy, makes medical claims regarding our products or uses our products to perform medical diagnoses or other activities limited to licensed professionals or approved medical devices (in markets where the product is not approved), it could negatively impact our ability to market or sell these products and subject us to legal or regulatory actions.\nWhere necessary, obtaining medical device registrations and clearances could require us to provide documentation concerning product manufacturing and clinical utility, to make design, specification and manufacturing process modifications to meet standards imposed on medical device companies, and to modify our marketing claims regarding the registered product. While we successfully obtained clearance to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use in the United States, and registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand, Peru and Colombia, because medical device regulations vary widely from market to market, there can be no assurance we will not face challenges or delays in obtaining clearance in other markets, or that we will be able to make any required modifications or provide documentation necessary to obtain clearance. If we obtain such medical device clearance in order to sell a product in one market, such clearance may be used as precedent for requiring similar approval for the product in another market, or for similar products in the same market. These additional requirements could increase the cost associated with manufacturing and selling these products as non-medical devices in such markets.\nWe may incur product liability claims that could harm our business.\nWe sell a variety of different products for human consumption and use, including cosmetics, dietary supplements, conventional foods, OTC drugs and devices. Our cosmetics and conventional foods, as well as some of our dietary supplements, are not generally subject to pre-market approval or registration processes so we cannot rely upon a government safety panel to qualify or approve our products for use, and some ingredients may not have long histories of human consumption or use. We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products and conduct our own clinical and safety studies on some key ingredients and products, but not all products. A product may be safe for the general population when consumed or used as directed but could cause an adverse reaction for some individuals, such as a person who has a health condition or allergies or who is taking a prescription medication. While we include what we believe are adequate instructions and warnings and we have historically had low numbers of reported reactions, previously unknown adverse reactions could occur. If we discover that our products are causing adverse reactions, or if we determine that any of our employees have not properly handled reports of adverse reactions, we could suffer further adverse publicity or government sanctions.\nAs a result of the type of products that we sell, we may be subject to various product liability claims, including that the products fail to meet quality or manufacturing specifications, contain contaminants, include inadequate instructions as to their proper use, include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances or for persons with health conditions or allergies, or cause adverse reactions or side effects. Consumer protection laws and regulations governing our business continue to expand, and in some states such as California, class-action lawsuits based on increasingly novel theories of liability are expanding. Product liability claims could increase our costs, cause negative publicity, and adversely affect our business and financial results. As we continue to offer an increasing number of new products through large product offerings our product liability risk may increase.\nIf our sales force or employees provide improper or inappropriate advice regarding our products, their use or safety, we may be subject to additional product liability.\nWe have generally elected to self-insure our product liability risks. We continue to periodically evaluate whether we can and should obtain product liability insurance. Based upon our current approach to product liability risk management, if any of our products are found to cause any injury or damage or we become subject to product liability claims, we will be subject to the full amount of liability associated with any injuries or damages. This liability could be substantial and may exceed our existing reserves and harm our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nWe have been, and regularly are, a party to litigation, government inquiries or investigations, audits or other legal matters. These legal proceedings may include, among other things, claims alleging violation of the federal securities laws or state corporate laws, or claims related to employment matters, intellectual property, fair-competition/anti-trust laws, our products, business opportunity or advertising, or other matters. Claims may be brought by a regulator, investor, member of our sales force, consumer, employee or other private parties and in some cases may be brought as class action lawsuits. For example, in 2014, we were named as a defendant in a purported class action complaint relating to negative media and regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China and as a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative suit relating to the same issues. Also, beginning in 2014, we were in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which discussions were focused on a charitable donation we made in Mainland China in 2013 and issues related thereto. In April 2015, the SEC informed us that it was initiating a non-public, formal investigation into these issues. We also have been involved in two separate disputes with customs authorities in Japan with respect to customs assessments on several of our products. Although we settled the purported class action, shareholder derivative action and SEC investigation during 2016 and the Japan courts reached final decisions on the customs disputes in 2013 and 2018, these matters were, and any future matters that we may become involved in may be, expensive and time consuming.\nOur increased activity during the past several years with acquisitions, divestments and other investment-related activities introduces an additional area of litigation risk, and we have had litigation and threats of litigation related to these matters. Other parties in the transactions or potential transactions, or other parties involved in the businesses themselves, could bring claims against us. For example, we are currently in litigation with Don Roberts, a dairy farmer who claims he is a general partner in our indoor-growing business and related businesses. Mr. Roberts also seeks damages exceeding $250 million. Although we believe Mr. Roberts\u2019s claims are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this or other cases will be favorable to us.\nIn general, litigation claims, regulatory actions or other legal matters are expensive and time consuming and can result in settlements, adverse rulings or damages that could significantly affect financial results and the conduct of our business. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of any legal proceeding to which we may become party, and the impact of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nOur international operations are subject to various anti-corruption laws, including principally the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions where we operate generally prohibit companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and they require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal accounting controls. We dedicate time and resources to internal investigations of any allegation that we are not or may not be in compliance with anti-corruption laws. Additionally, such allegations, even if untrue, may result in a government investigation, particularly given the trend in recent years of increased anti-corruption law enforcement activity and regulatory investigative actions by regulators in numerous jurisdictions, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. Our corporate policies require all employees to comply with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA\u2019s books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls requirements. Any regulatory determination, however, that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines and other penalties from U.S. or other regulatory entities.\nIn 2016, we reached a resolution with the SEC to pay $765,688 to settle the SEC\u2019s allegations that our books and records and internal controls related to a charitable contribution in Mainland China in 2013 were insufficient. In agreeing to this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings. Although we have implemented additional anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to prevent similar situations from arising in the future, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective or prevent future fines or penalties under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. Our competitors operating in Mainland China have also faced similar allegations from U.S. regulators and been fined accordingly in some circumstances. For example, in 2020, one of our competitors entered into a large settlement with U.S. regulators related to allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in Mainland China.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or new laws might be administered or interpreted. Alleged or actual violations of any such existing or future laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others) may result in criminal or civil sanctions or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our regulatory compliance efforts could harm our stock price and our financial and operating results or could result in fines or penalties.\nWe have implemented internal controls to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of our financial reporting and to detect and prevent fraudulent actions within our financial and accounting processes. We have also implemented compliance policies and programs to help ensure that our employees and sales force comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal audit team regularly audits our internal controls and various aspects of our business and compliance program, and we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. There can be no assurance, however, that our internal or external assessments and audits will identify all fraud, misstatements in our financial reporting, and significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. Material weaknesses have in the past, and may in the future, resulted in a material misstatement of our financial results, requiring us to restate our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, we initiate further investigations into our business operations to further bolster our regulatory compliance efforts or based on the results of our internal and external audits or on complaints, questions or allegations made by employees or other parties regarding our business practices and operations. In addition, our business and operations may be investigated by applicable government authorities. In the event any of these investigations identify material violations of applicable laws by our employees, sales force or affiliates, we could be subject to adverse publicity, fines, penalties or loss of licenses or permits.\nRisks Associated with Taxes, Customs and Interest\nGovernment authorities may question our tax or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business globally, we are subject to applicable tax and customs laws, including those relating to intercompany pricing regulations and transactions between our corporate entities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Periodically, we are audited by tax and customs authorities around the world. If authorities challenge our tax or customs positions, including those regarding transfer pricing, customs valuation and classification, value added taxes (VAT), withholding taxes, payroll taxes, and other applicable taxes, we may be subject to penalties, interest and payment of back taxes or customs duties. The tax and customs laws in each jurisdiction change from time to time and are further subject to interpretation by the local government agencies. Despite our best efforts to be aware of and comply with tax and customs laws, including changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a potential risk that the local authorities may argue that we are out of compliance. Such situations may require that we defend our positions and/or adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes. We are currently subject to ongoing audits that are at various levels of review, assessment, or appeal in different markets involving issues of transfer pricing, income taxes, VAT, withholding taxes, payroll taxes, and other taxes. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been assessed. We have reserved in our consolidated financial statements an amount that we believe represents the most likely outcome of the resolution of these audits, but if we are incorrect in our assessment, we may have to pay additional amounts, which could potentially be material. Ultimate resolution of these ongoing audits may take several years, and the outcome is uncertain. Any or all of these potential risks may increase our effective tax rate, increase our overall tax or customs expense or otherwise harm our business.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where our subsidiaries are organized. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to change, with or without notice, due to economic, political and other conditions. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, changes in our business operations, acquisitions and dispositions, entry into new markets, the amount of our earnings and where earned, losses incurred in jurisdictions, the inability to realize tax benefits, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, uncertain tax positions, allocation and apportionment of state taxes, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments may enact tax laws or enter into tax treaties that could result in further changes to global taxation and may materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our estimates for the tax accruals are reasonable, the outcome of audits, investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our tax accruals, which could materially impact our financial results.\nTransition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate could have an adverse effect on our overall financial position.\nOur indebtedness levels and the required payments on such indebtedness may be impacted by expected reforms related to LIBOR. The variable interest rates payable under our credit facility are linked to LIBOR as the benchmark for establishing such rates. Recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform proposals regarding LIBOR are expected to ultimately cause LIBOR to be discontinued or become unavailable as a benchmark rate. Although our credit facility includes mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of LIBOR, no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to LIBOR and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had LIBOR remained in effect. In addition, as previously disclosed, we currently plan to refinance our credit facility during 2022. There can be no assurance that credit will be available on favorable terms, including a favorable interest rate, which could negatively impact our liquidity and ability to fund our business initiatives.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement on the intellectual property rights or trade secrets of others, resulting in costly litigation.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, there has been an increase in the filing of suits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, which pressure defendants into entering into settlement arrangements quickly to dispose of such suits, regardless of their merit. Other companies or individuals may allege that we, or our sales force, consumers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, defending such intellectual property litigation can be costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Any of these results may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other beauty or wellness product companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent that our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those in which they were involved with their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or our proprietary information and know-how, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted and the value of our products could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other markets, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, sales force, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. In addition, the laws of certain foreign markets where we have significant business, including markets such as Mainland China, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nThe costs required to protect our patents and trademarks may be substantial or even not practical. We have filed patent and trademark applications globally to protect our intellectual property rights in our new technologies; however, there can be no assurance that our patent and trademark applications will be approved and issue, that any patents and trademarks issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents and trademarks will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, many of our products rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nFrom time to time, we become aware of potential violations of our intellectual property rights. For example, we are aware of some products that may infringe on our intellectual property related to the ageLOC LumiSpa device. To enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as patent, copyright and trademark infringement suits or interference proceedings and seek indemnification by contract or otherwise. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and we may ultimately fail to prevail or recover on any indemnification claim. Litigation also puts our patents and trademarks at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent and trademark applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our financial condition or diminish our investments in this area.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. Our employees may leave to work for competitors. Our sales force members may seek other opportunities. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our current or former employees, sales force, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and adversely affect our financial condition.\nData Security and Privacy Risks\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of company, employee, sales force or guest data could expose us to data loss, litigation, liability and harm to our reputation.\nWe collect, store and transmit large volumes of company, employee, sales force and guest data, including payment card information, personally identifiable information and other personal information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The connected devices that we are developing and plan to introduce will also collect consumer data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business.\nWe are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the payment card industry. For example, during 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in the European Union, imposing increased data protection regulations, the violation of which could result in fines of up to 4% of our annual consolidated revenue. Many other jurisdictions have similarly enacted security and privacy regulations, including California and Mainland China, and we believe this trend will continue. In the United States, congressional committees have held preliminary hearings about the advisability of a federal data privacy law, but it is uncertain whether the federal government will adopt such a law and whether it would preempt state data privacy laws. The prospect of new data privacy laws and ambiguity regarding the interpretation of existing laws has resulted in significant uncertainty and compliance costs. In addition to laws specifically governing privacy and data security, in some cases, federal and state regulators and state attorneys general and administrative agencies have interpreted more general consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Although we monitor regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant penalties, lawsuits and negative publicity and require changes to our business practices. In particular, maintaining compliance with these and other evolving regulations and requirements around the world often requires changes to our information system architecture and data storage processes. Making these changes is, and will likely continue to be, difficult and expensive. Investigations by the regulators of data security laws could also result in the payment of fines and harm our reputation. Private actions by affected individuals could also result in significant monetary or reputational damage.\nSimilarly, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could cause us to incur penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, litigation and adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release, misuse or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, sales force or guest data. Although we take measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of our data systems, we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees and types on a regular basis. Our infrastructure may be vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases it could take time to discover them. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise. This risk is heightened as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic as many of our employees are working remotely. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of sensitive information and lead to significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory inquiries or investigations, loss of confidence by our sales force and customers, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, and costs associated with remediating the incident. These risks are heightened as we work with third-party providers, including providers of mobile and cloud technologies, and as our sales force uses social media, as the providers and social media platforms could be vulnerable to the same types of breaches and other risks. Acquisition activity, which we have engaged in and which we may continue to engage in, may also heighten these risks, as the systems of the companies we acquire are not under our control prior to the acquisitions and it may take time to evaluate these systems and implement appropriate modifications to them.\nSustainability Risks\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.\nThere are increased and increasing expectations and focus from certain investors, Brand Affiliates, consumers, employees, regulators and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, including environmental, social and governance matters; packaging; responsible sourcing; and diversity, equity and inclusion matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives and goals in these areas. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or in meeting stakeholders\u2019 expectations, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives, goals and expectations. Moreover, the standards by which corporate citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions. The standards or assumptions could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters, such as with our carbon footprint, recyclability of our packaging, ingredients used in our products or the sourcing of such ingredients. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control.\nOur Class A common stock closed at $32.59 per share on January 31, 2020 and closed at $48.19 per share on January 31, 2022. During this two-year period, our common stock traded as low as $12.31 per share and as high as $63.85 per share. Many factors, including some we may be unable to control, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\ngovernment investigations of our business;\n\u25cf\ntrends or adverse publicity related to our business, products, industry or competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe sale of shares of Class A common stock by significant stockholders;\n\u25cf\ndemand, and general trends in the market, for our products;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\neconomic or currency exchange issues in markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nchanges in estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nspeculative trading, including short selling and options trading; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, business, regulatory and political conditions.\nBroad market fluctuations could also lower the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDifficult economic conditions could harm our business.\nDifficult economic conditions, such as high unemployment levels, inflation, or recession, could adversely affect our business by causing a decline in demand for our products, particularly if the economic conditions are prolonged or worsen. For example, an increase in oil prices would likely cause our shipping expenses to increase, which would negatively affect our profitability. In addition, economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease the ability of our sales force and consumers to obtain or maintain credit cards, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition. There also appears to be increased concerns about potential inflationary pressures, which could have a negative impact on our business if it impacts the discretionary spending of our consumers.", "PERMNO": 84172, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "NUS"}
