Some of these risks are described below, and the reader should take such risks into account in evaluating HealthSouth or any investment decision involving HealthSouth. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. More detailed information concerning other risk factors as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nReductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third-party payors and other legislative and regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our Net operating revenues from the Medicare program. See Item 1, Business, \u201cSources of Revenues,\u201d for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues. Historically, Congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the healthcare system. Many of these changes have resulted in limitations on the increases in and, in some cases, significant roll-backs or reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs. There can be no assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result in pricing roll-backs or freezes or reimbursement reductions.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the \u201c2010 Healthcare Reform Laws\u201d). Many provisions within the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have impacted or could in the future impact our business, including: (1) reducing annual market basket updates to providers, which include annual productivity adjustment reductions; (2) the possible combining, or \u201cbundling,\u201d of reimbursement for a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s episode of care at some point in the future; (3) implementing a voluntary program for accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d); and (4) creating an Independent Payment Advisory Board.\nMost notably for us, these laws include reductions in the annual market basket updates for hospitals and, as discussed below in \u201c-Risks Related to the Acquisition of Encompass,\u201d home health and hospice providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) makes annual adjustments to Medicare reimbursement rates by what is commonly known as a \u201cmarket basket update.\u201d The reductions in the annual market basket updates for our hospitals continue through 2019 for each CMS fiscal year, which for us begins October 1, as follows:\n2015-16\n2017-19\n0.2%\n0.75%\nIn addition, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws require the market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis. The productivity adjustments equal the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The productivity adjustment in effect for both fiscal year (October 1 to September 30) 2014 and 2015 is a decrease to the market basket update of 50 basis points.\nThe 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws also directed HHS to examine the feasibility of bundling, including conducting a voluntary, multi-year bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies. On January 31, 2013, CMS announced the selection of participants in the initial phase of limited-scope, voluntary bundling pilot projects. There are four project types: acute care only, acute/post-acute, post-acute only, and acute and physician services. In the initial non-risk bearing stage of the bundling program (Phase 1), pilot participants receive data from CMS on care patterns and engage in shared learning in how to improve care. The second phase (Phase 2) requires participants in that phase, pending contract finalization and completion of the standard CMS program integrity reviews, to take on financial risk for episodes of care. Whether any participant transitions from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is discretionary. In the current transition period, Phase 1 participants electing to move to Phase 2 will do so by either April or July 2015. CMS previously selected as participants a small number of acute care hospitals with which we have relationships. To date, we have agreed to participate in a few Model 2 (acute/post-acute) bundling projects as a post-acute rehabilitation provider, a couple of which have transitioned to Phase 2 for our acute care partners. We have also applied to enroll into Phase 2 a small number of our hospitals participating in Model 3 (post-acute only). We will continue to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the appropriateness of bundling opportunities for our operations and patients.\nSimilarly, in October 2011, CMS established, per the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the Medicare Shared Savings Program (\u201cMSSP\u201d), a voluntary ACO program in which hospitals, physicians, and other care providers pursue the delivery of coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. Conceptually, ACOs will receive a portion of any savings generated above a certain threshold from care coordination as long as benchmarks for the quality of care are maintained. Under the MSSP, there are two different ACO tracks from which participants can choose. The first track allows ACOs to share only in the savings. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and losses but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings realized than the first track offers. In October 2014, CMS introduced a new initiative for ACOs participating in the MSSP. This new ACO investment model is designed to promote coordinated care in rural and under-served markets by offering pre-payment of shared savings in both up front and ongoing per beneficiary per month payments. The ACO rules adopted by CMS are extremely complex and remain subject to further refinement by CMS. As with bundling, we are currently evaluating, on a case-by-case basis, appropriate ACO participation opportunities for our hospitals and patients. We have expressed interest in participating in several ACOs and have executed one participation agreement as of December 31, 2014. Encompass is currently party to one newly formed ACO and is exploring several other participation opportunities.\nThe bundling and ACO initiatives have served as motivating factors for regulators and healthcare industry participants to identify and implement workable coordinated care delivery models. Broad-based implementation of a new delivery model would represent a significant transformation for us and the healthcare industry generally. The nature and timing of the transformation of the current healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and payment models is uncertain and will likely remain so for some time. The development of new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly take significant time and expense. Many of the alternative approaches being explored may not work or could change substantially prior to a nationwide implementation. For further discussion of the associated challenges and our efforts to respond to them, see the \u201cExecutive Overview-Key Challenges-Changes to Our Operating Environment Resulting from Healthcare Reform\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAnother provision of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board appointed by the President that is charged with presenting proposals, beginning in 2014, to Congress to reduce Medicare expenditures upon the occurrence of Medicare expenditures exceeding a certain level. This board will have broad authority to develop new Medicare policies (including changes to provider reimbursement). In general, unless Congress acts to block the proposals of this board, CMS will implement the policy recommendations. However, due to the market basket reductions that are also part of these laws, certain healthcare providers, such as our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, will not be subject to payment reduction proposals developed by this board and presented to Congress until 2020. While most of our operations may not be subject to its payment reduction proposals for a period of time, based on the scope of this board\u2019s directive to reduce Medicare expenditures and the significance of Medicare as a payor to us, other decisions made by this board may adversely impact our results of operations, including reductions in the payment for home health services. As of December 31, 2014, the Independent Payment Advisory Board members have not been appointed.\nMany aspects of implementation and interpretation of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws remain uncertain. Given the complexity and the number of changes in these laws as well as subsequent regulatory developments and delays, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws. However, we believe the provisions discussed above are the issues with the greatest potential impact on us.\nThe 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws include other provisions that could adversely affect us as well. They include the expansion of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and the False Claims Act that, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. Changes include increased resources for enforcement, lowered burden of proof for the government in healthcare fraud matters, expanded definition of claims under the False Claims Act, enhanced penalties, and increased rewards for relators in successful prosecutions. CMS may also suspend payment for claims prospectively if, in its opinion, credible allegations of fraud exist. The initial suspension period may be up to 180 days. However, the payment suspension period can be extended almost indefinitely if the matter is under investigation by the HHS Office of Inspector General (the \u201cHHS-OIG\u201d) or the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d). Any such suspension would adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurther, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS established new quality data reporting, effective October 1, 2012, for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities (\u201cIRFs\u201d). A facility\u2019s failure to submit the required quality data will result in a two percentage point reduction to that facility\u2019s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent fiscal year. IRFs began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our hospitals met the reporting deadlines occurring on or before December 31, 2013 resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions for fiscal year 2015. There can be no assurance all of our hospitals will do so for future periods which may result in one or more of our hospitals seeing a reduction in its reimbursements. Additionally, CMS requires reporting of two new quality measures, beginning January 1, 2015, and will conduct validation audits to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the quality data\nsubmitted. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are also required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket update. For additional discussion of general healthcare regulation, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cRegulation.\u201d\nSome states in which we operate have also undertaken, or are considering, healthcare reform initiatives that address similar issues. While many of the stated goals of other federal and state reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal to provide care that is high-quality and cost-effective, legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements, increase the cost of compliance, decrease patient volumes, and otherwise adversely affect our business. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be enacted, implemented or amended, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us.\nOn August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided for an automatic 2% reduction of Medicare program payments. This automatic reduction, known as \u201csequestration,\u201d which began affecting payments received after April 1, 2013, reduced the payments we receive under the IRF prospective payment system (the \u201cIRF-PPS\u201d) resulting in a net year-over-year decrease in our Net operating revenues of approximately $9 million in 2014. The effect of sequestration on year-over-year comparisons of Net operating revenues ceased on April 1, 2014. However, each year through 2024, the reimbursement we receive from Medicare, after first taking into account all annual payment adjustments including the market basket update, will be reduced by sequestration unless it is repealed before then.\nAdditionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit, national debt levels, and reforming the sustainable growth rate formula used to pay physicians who treat Medicare beneficiaries (the so called \u201cDoc Fix\u201d) could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, and/or further reductions to provider payments. For example, in October 2014, the President signed into law the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d). The IMPACT Act was developed on a bi-partisan basis by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees and incorporated feedback from healthcare providers and provider organizations that responded to the Committees\u2019 solicitation of post-acute payment reform ideas and proposals. It directs HHS, in consultation with healthcare stakeholders, to implement standardized data collection processes for post-acute quality and outcome measures. Although the IMPACT Act does not specifically call for the development of a new post-acute payment system, we believe this act will lay the foundation for possible future post-acute payment policies that would be based on patients\u2019 medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the setting where the care is provided. It will create additional data reporting requirements for our hospitals and home health and hospice agencies. The precise details of these new reporting requirements, including timing and content, will be developed and implemented by CMS through the regulatory process that we expect will take place over the next several years. While we cannot quantify the potential financial effects of the IMPACT Act on HealthSouth, we believe any post-acute payment system that is data-driven and focuses on the needs and underlying medical conditions of post-acute patients ultimately will be a net positive for providers who offer high-quality, cost-effective care. However, it will likely take years for the related quality measures to be established, quality data to be gathered, standardized patient assessment data to be assembled and disseminated, and potential payment policies to be developed, tested, and promulgated.\nEach year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), an independent agency that advises Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including the IRF-PPS, the home health prospective payment system, and the hospice prospective payment system. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations in a given year. For example, in recent years, Congress has not adopted any of the recommendations on the annual market basket update to Medicare payment rates under the IRF-PPS. We cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives, Medicare payment reductions, or post-acute care reforms, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. If enacted, such initiatives or reductions would likely be challenging for all providers, would likely have the effect of limiting Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to healthcare services, and could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to maintain increased case volumes or reduce operating costs to offset any future pricing roll-back, reduction, freeze, or increased costs associated with new regulatory compliance obligations, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our results could be further adversely affected by other changes in laws or regulations governing the Medicare program, as well as possible changes to or expansion of the audit processes conducted by Medicare contractors or Medicare recovery audit contractors. For additional discussion of healthcare reform and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cSources of Revenues-Medicare Reimbursement.\u201d\nIn addition, there are increasing pressures, including as a result of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, from many third-party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services. Our relationships with managed care and nongovernmental third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, are generally governed by negotiated agreements. These agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third-party payors.\nOur third-party payors may also, from time to time, request audits of the amounts paid, or to be paid, to us. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to us due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations.\nCompliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers requires substantial time, effort and expense, and if we fail to comply with them, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nHealthcare providers are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification, and accreditation;\n\u2022\npolicies, either at the national or local level, delineating what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement under Medicare (also referred to as coverage requirements);\n\u2022\ncoding and billing for services;\n\u2022\nrequirements of the 60% compliance threshold under the 2007 Medicare Act;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources, including physician self-referral and anti-kickback laws;\n\u2022\nquality of medical care;\n\u2022\nuse and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment;\n\u2022\nmaintenance and security of patient information and medical records;\n\u2022\nacquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances; and\n\u2022\ndisposal of medical and hazardous waste.\nIn the future, changes in these laws or regulations or the manner in which they are enforced could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our hospitals, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs, operating procedures, and contractual arrangements, as well as the way in which we deliver home health and hospice services. Those changes could also affect reimbursements as well as future training and staffing costs. Of note, the HHS-OIG each year releases a work plan that identifies areas of compliance focus for the coming year.\nExamples of regulatory changes that can affect our business, beyond direct changes to Medicare reimbursement rates, can be found from time to time in CMS rules. The final rule for the fiscal year 2010 IRF-PPS implemented new coverage requirements which provided in part that a patient medical record must document a reasonable expectation that, at the time of admission to an IRF, the patient generally required and was able to participate in the intensive rehabilitation therapy services uniquely provided at IRFs. CMS has also taken the position that a patient\u2019s medical file must appropriately document the rationale for the use of group therapies, as opposed to one-on-one therapy. As previously noted, the appropriate utilization of group therapy was a focus of recent HHS-OIG work plans. Beginning on October 1, 2015, a new data collection requirement will go into effect that will capture the minutes and mode (individual, group, concurrent, or co-treatment) of therapy by specialty. CMS plans to use this data to potentially support future rulemaking in this area. Additionally, the final rules for the fiscal years 2014 and 2015 IRF-PPS include changes, effective October 1, 2015, to the list of medical conditions, including a reduction in the number of conditions, that will presumptively count toward the 60% compliance threshold to qualify for reimbursement as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital.\nThe clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, are essential to demonstrating our compliance with various regulatory and reimbursement requirements. For\nexample, to support the determination that a patient\u2019s IRF treatment was reasonable and necessary, the file must contain, among other things, an admitting physician\u2019s assessment of the patient as well as a post-admission assessment by the treating physician and other information from clinicians relating to the plan of care and the therapies being provided. These physicians exercise their independent medical judgment. We and our hospital medical directors, who are independent contractors, provide training to the physicians we work with on a regular basis regarding appropriate documentation. In connection with subsequent payment audits and investigations, there can be no assurance as to what opinion a third party may take regarding the status of patient files or the physicians\u2019 medical judgment evidenced in those files.\nThe 2012 and 2013 HHS-OIG work plans for IRFs focused on timely submissions of patient assessment instruments, the examination of the level of therapy being provided, and the appropriate utilization of concurrent and group therapy. The 2014 work plan provides that the HHS-OIG will review matters related to adverse and temporary harm events occurring in IRFs, and conduct audits of home health claims to ensure documentation exists to support payments. In addition, the 2015 work plan indicates HHS-OIG will review the home health prospective payment system requirements.\nOn March 4, 2013, we received document subpoenas from an office of the HHS-OIG addressed to four of our hospitals. Those subpoenas requested complete copies of medical records for 100 patients treated at each of those hospitals between September 2008 and June 2012. The investigation is being conducted by the DOJ. On April 24, 2014, we received document subpoenas relating to an additional seven of our hospitals. The new subpoenas reference substantially similar investigation subject matter as the original subpoenas and request materials from the period January 2008 through December 2013. Two of the four hospitals addressed in the original set of subpoenas have received supplemental subpoenas to cover this new time period. The new subpoenas do not include requests for specific patient files, but it is expected that such requests will be made for the new group of hospitals.\nAll of the subpoenas are in connection with an investigation of alleged improper or fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and requests documents and materials relating to practices, procedures, protocols and policies, of certain pre- and post-admissions activities at these hospitals including, among other things, marketing functions, pre-admission screening, post-admission physician evaluations, patient assessment instruments, individualized patient plans of care, and compliance with the Medicare 60% rule. Under the Medicare rule commonly referred to as the \u201c60% rule,\u201d an inpatient rehabilitation hospital must treat 60% or more of its patients from at least one of a specified list of medical conditions in order to be reimbursed at the inpatient rehabilitation hospital payment rates, rather than at the lower acute care hospital payment rates. We are currently unable to predict the timing or outcome of these investigations, and the DOJ has expressly reserved its right to make additional requests.\nAlthough we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial time, effort, and expense in implementing and maintaining training programs as well as internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be required to return portions of reimbursements for discharges deemed after the fact to have not been appropriate under the IRF-PPS. We could also be subjected to other liabilities, including (1) criminal penalties, (2) civil penalties, including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals, and (3) exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs, which, if lengthy in duration and material to us, could potentially trigger a default under our credit agreement. Because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, it is important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements. As discussed above in connection with the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the federal government has in the last couple of years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities. In the past few years, the DOJ and HHS as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to ensure strict compliance with various reimbursement related regulations as well as combat healthcare fraud. The DOJ has pursued and recovered a record amount of taxpayer dollars lost to healthcare fraud. Additionally, the federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent a violation of the False Claims Act.\nReductions in reimbursements, substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation, depending on its nature, could have a material adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.\nReimbursement claims are subject to various audits from time to time and such audits may delay or reduce receipt of the related reimbursement amounts for services previously provided.\nReimbursement claims made by health care providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d), fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be\nconsidered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and liquidity.\nWith respect to the Medicare program, from which we receive a substantial portion of our revenues, CMS has developed and instituted various audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. These audits are in addition to those conducted by existing MACs. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201dRACs\u201d), receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid, beginning with claims filed on or after October 1, 2007.\nRAC audits of IRFs initially focused on coding errors, but have subsequently been expanded to medical necessity reviews. In connection with CMS approved and announced RAC audits related to IRFs, we received requests to review certain patient files for discharges occurring from 2010 to 2014. To date, the Medicare payments that are subject to these audit requests represent less than 1% of our Medicare patient discharges during those years, and not all of these patient files requests have resulted in payment denial determinations by the RACs. These post-payment RAC audits are focused on medical necessity requirements for admission to IRFs rather than targeting a specific diagnosis code as in previous pre-payment audits. Medical necessity is a subjective assessment by an independent physician of a patient\u2019s ability to tolerate and benefit from intensive multi-disciplinary therapy provided in an IRF setting. Because we have confidence in the medical judgment of both the referring and the admitting physicians who assess the treatment needs of our patients, we have appealed substantially all RAC denials arising from these audits.\nThe contracts awarded to RACs by CMS were set to expire in February 2014, but they have been extended and modified pending finalization of new contracts. In late February 2014, CMS announced it would pause the operations of the current RACs until new contracts are awarded, meaning that hospitals would not receive any new requests from RACs until that time. Legal challenges to the contract award process have delayed finalizing the new contracts longer than expected, and as a result, CMS modified the existing RAC contracts to allow some RAC reviews to be restarted on a limited basis. Additionally, on December 30, 2014, CMS announced the beginning of a new contract for the RAC assigned to audit payments for home health and hospice services, which has subsequently been delayed by another challenge. Once the new contracts are in place, whether for IRFs or home health and hospice agencies, the associated RACs will be able to audit claims for dates of service during the time period covered by the pause in RAC operations.\nWe cannot predict when the legal challenges to the new contracts will be resolved or when CMS will otherwise finalize the new RAC contracts. While we make provisions for these claims based on our historical experience and success rates in the claims adjudication process, which is the same process we follow for appealing denials of certain diagnosis codes by MACs, we cannot provide assurance as to our future success in the resolution of these and future disputes, nor can we predict or estimate the scope or number of denials that ultimately may be received. However, due to additional delays announced by CMS in the related adjudication process, we believe the resolution of any claims that are subsequently denied as a result of these RAC audits could take in excess of two years.\nOn August 27, 2012, CMS launched its three-year demonstration project that expanded the RAC program to include prepayment review of Medicare fee-for-service claims. Currently, acute care hospitals are the primary subject of this review project, but CMS could expand it to inpatient post-acute providers. This demonstration project will identify specific diagnosis codes for review, and the RAC contractors will review the selected claims to determine if they are proper before payment has been made to the provider. The project covers 11 states, including some states in which we operate, such as Florida, California, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Providers with claims identified for RAC prepayment reviews will have 30 days to respond to requests for additional documentation. If they do not respond timely, the claim will be denied. Providers receive determinations within 45 days of submitting the relevant documentation.\nCMS has also established contractors known as the Zone Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cZPICs\u201d). These contractors are successors to the Program Safeguard Contractors and conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues. Like the RACs, the ZPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the DOJ. Unlike RACs, however, ZPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error.\nAudits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or submitted improper claims in some instances, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid or disallow reimbursement. As a result, we may suffer reduced profitability. Our right to appeal audit determinations may lead to cash flow delays. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us.\nWe face national, regional, and local competition for patients from other healthcare providers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Although we are the nation\u2019s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged, revenues, and number of hospitals, in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages. For example, acute care hospitals, including those owned and operated by large public companies, may choose to expand or begin offering post-acute rehabilitation services. Given that approximately 92% of our hospitals\u2019 referrals come from acute care hospitals, that increase in competition might materially and adversely affect our admission referrals in the related markets. For a discussion of the competition risks faced by our home health and hospice business, see \u201c-Competition among home health and hospice service companies is intense\u201d below. There can be no assurance this competition, or other competition which we may encounter in the future, will not adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, from time to time, there are efforts in states with certificate of need (\u201cCON\u201d) laws to weaken those laws, which could potentially increase competition in those states. Conversely, competition and statutory procedural requirements in some CON states may inhibit our ability to expand our operations. For a breakdown of the CON status of the states and territories in which we have operations, see Item 2, Properties.\nWe may have difficulty completing investments and transactions that increase our capacity consistent with our growth strategy.\nWe are selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions of, and in some instances joint ventures with, other healthcare providers. We may face limitations on our ability to identify sufficient acquisition or other development targets and to complete those transactions to meet goals. In many states, the need to obtain governmental approvals, such as a CON or an approval of a change in ownership, may operate as a significant obstacle to completing transactions. Additionally, in states with CON laws, it is not unusual for third-party providers to challenge initial awards of CONs, the increase in the number of approved beds in an existing CON, or expand or change the area served, and the adjudication of those challenges and related appeals may take multiple years.\nWe may make investments or complete transactions that may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nInvestments, acquisitions, joint ventures or other development opportunities identified and completed may involve material cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, issuances of equity securities, and expenses, some of which are unforeseen, that could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations, including state CONs as well as CMS and other regulatory approval requirements, on our ability to complete such acquisitions, particularly those involving not-for-profit providers, on terms, timetables, and valuations reasonable to us;\n\u2022\nlimitations in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a cost reasonable to us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, and information systems, and in realizing projected revenues, efficiencies and cost savings, or returns on invested capital;\n\u2022\nentry into markets, businesses or services in which we may have little or no experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of business resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations; and\n\u2022\nexposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired operations, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and anti-trust considerations in specific markets.\nIn addition to those development activities, we intend to build new, or de novo, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. The construction of new hospitals involves numerous risks, including the receipt of all zoning and other regulatory approvals, such as a CON where necessary, construction delays and cost over-runs. Once built, new hospitals must undergo the state and Medicare certification process, the duration of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to operate newly constructed hospitals as profitably as expected, and those hospitals may involve significant additional cash expenditures and operating expenses that could, in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompetition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, union activity or other factors may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical personnel, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our locations. In some markets, the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing all healthcare providers. This shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to contract for more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not experience reimbursement rate increases to offset these additional costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited. In particular, if labor costs rise at an annual rate greater than our net annual market basket update from Medicare, our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected. Conversely, decreases in reimbursement revenues, such as with sequestration, may limit our ability to increase compensation or benefits to the extent necessary to retain key employees, in turn increasing our turnover and associated costs. Union activity is another factor that may contribute to increased labor costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified medical personnel, or to control our labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims, and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits. The material lawsuits and investigations, including the subpoenas received from HHS-OIG, are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Substantial damages, fines, or other remedies assessed against us or agreed to in settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the costs of defending litigation and investigations, even if frivolous or nonmeritorious, could be significant.\nWe insure a substantial portion of our professional liability, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation liability risks through our captive insurance subsidiary, as discussed further in Note 9, Self-Insured Risks, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Changes in the number of these liability claims and the cost to resolve them impact the reserves for these risks. A variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of the reserves for these liability risks, which could have an effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe False Claims Act allows private citizens, called \u201crelators,\u201d to institute civil proceedings alleging violations of the False Claims Act. These qui tam cases are sealed by the court at the time of filing. Prior to the lifting of the seal by the court, the only parties typically privy to the information contained in the complaint are the relator, the federal government, and the presiding court. It is possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against us and that those suits remain under seal or that we are unaware of such filings or prevented by existing law or court order from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. We may be subject to liability under one or more undisclosed qui tam cases brought pursuant to the False Claims Act.\nThe proper function, availability, and security of our information systems are critical to our business.\nWe are and will remain dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our and third-party information systems, including our electronic clinical information system (the \u201cCIS\u201d) which plays a substantial role in the operations of the hospitals in which it is installed and any information systems currently in use by Encompass. We undertake substantial measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and we regularly test the adequacy of our security and disaster recovery measures. We have implemented administrative, technical and physical controls on our systems and devices in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to that data, which includes protected health information subject to the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and other sensitive information. For additional discussion of these laws, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulation.\u201d As part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches, including cyber-attacks, or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to patient data and protected health information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. However, given the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures or network security or other controls will detect and prevent security or data breaches, including\ncyber-attacks, in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations. We may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems as well as any systems used in acquired operations such as Encompass. A compromise of our safety and security measures, or network security or other controls, or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to significant remedial costs as well as regulatory actions and claims from patients, financial institutions, and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. In the case of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. Failure to maintain proper function, security, or availability of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur CIS is subject to a licensing, implementation, technology hosting, and support agreement with Cerner Corporation. In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Cerner to begin a company-wide implementation of this system in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we have installed the CIS in 58 hospitals with another 24 installations scheduled for 2015. We expect to complete installation in our existing hospitals by the end of 2017. Our inability, or the inability of Cerner, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems, software, and hardware could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, costs, unexpected problems, and interruptions associated with the implementation or transition to new systems or technology or with adequate support of those systems or technology across multiple hospitals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSuccessful execution of our current business plan depends on our key personnel.\nThe success of our current business plan depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. We rely upon their ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith. There can be no assurance that we will retain our key executives and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. If we lose key personnel, we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience in, or knowledge of, the healthcare provider industry or our specific post-acute segment. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur leverage or level of indebtedness may have negative consequences for our business, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nAlthough we have reduced our outstanding long-term debt substantially in recent years, we still had approximately$2.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding (including that portion of long-term debt classified as current and excluding $86.7 million in capital leases) as of December 31, 2014. See Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subject to specified limitations, our credit agreement and the indentures governing our debt securities permit us and our subsidiaries to incur material additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described here could intensify.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competing providers that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations for outstanding amounts under our credit facility, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nWe are subject to contingent liabilities, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. Although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions, we cannot provide assurance that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying\nobligations under our debt instruments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other needs, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing or reduce expenditures or sell assets we deem necessary to our business. We cannot provide assurance these measures would be possible or any additional financing could be obtained.\nThe restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes could affect our ability to execute aspects of our business plan successfully.\nThe terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes do, and our future debt instruments may, contain various provisions that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock; or repay, redeem or repurchase our subordinated obligations;\n\u2022\nissue or sell certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. For additional discussion of our material debt covenants, see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Although we remained in compliance with the financial ratios and financial condition tests as of December 31, 2014, we cannot provide assurance we will continue to do so. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests. A severe downturn in earnings or, if we have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the time, a rapid increase in interest rates could impair our ability to comply with those financial ratios and financial condition tests and we may need to obtain waivers from the required proportion of the lenders to avoid being in default. If we try to obtain a waiver or other relief from the required lenders, we may not be able to obtain it or such relief might have a material cost to us or be on terms less favorable than those in our existing debt. If a default occurs, the lenders could exercise their rights, including declaring all the funds borrowed (together with accrued and unpaid interest) to be immediately due and payable, terminating their commitments or instituting foreclosure proceedings against our assets, which, in turn, could cause the default and acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness. A breach of any other restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement or the indentures governing our senior notes would also (after giving effect to applicable grace periods, if any) result in an event of default with the same outcome.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 75% of our consolidated Property and equipment, net was held by HealthSouth Corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries under our credit agreement. See Note 8, Long-term Debt, and Note 20, Condensed Consolidating Financial Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and Item 2, Properties.\nUncertainty in the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our development objectives.\nThe global and sovereign credit markets have experienced significant disruptions in recent years, and in 2013, the debt ceiling and federal budget disputes in the United States affected capital markets. Future market shocks could negatively affect the availability or terms of certain types of debt and equity financing, including access to revolving lines of credit. Future business needs combined with market conditions at the time may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. For example, tight credit markets, such as might result from further turmoil in the sovereign debt markets, would likely make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain. The inability to obtain additional financing at attractive rates or prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance or our growth opportunities.\nAs a result of credit market uncertainty, we also face potential exposure to counterparties who may be unable to adequately service our needs, including the ability of the lenders under our credit agreement to provide liquidity when needed. We monitor the financial strength of our depositories, creditors, and insurance carriers using publicly available information, as well as qualitative inputs.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Encompass (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d)\nThe anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized, which could adversely impact our business and our operating results.\nWe anticipate the Acquisition will result in benefits including, among other things, enhanced revenues and our enhanced ability to provide a continuum of facility-based and home-based post-acute services. The acquired business may underperform relative to our expectations, including failing to continue to acquire and integrate other home health and hospice providers to the degree expected. If the acquired business underperforms and such underperformance is other than temporary, we may be required to take an impairment charge.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including general competitive factors in the marketplace. The acquired business may not contribute to our revenues or earnings to the extent anticipated, and the synergies we expect from the Acquisition may not be realized. Additionally, the costs or difficulties related to the integration of Encompass\u2019 business and operations into ours could be greater than expected, and the Acquisition could cause disruption to our business and operations and our relationships with customers, employees and other parties. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, inability to meet the financial ratios and financial condition tests under our credit agreement and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Thus, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized, and significant time and cost beyond that anticipated may be required in connection with the integration of HealthSouth and Encompass.\nEncompass, with a substantial portion of its revenues derived from Medicare, is subject to many of the same risks as HealthSouth\u2019s inpatient rehabilitation business. The reader should review the risks under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business,\u201d including \u201c-Compliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers requires substantial time, effort and expense, and if we fail to comply with them, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations,\u201d \u201c-We are a defendant in various lawsuits, and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us,\u201d and \u201c-The proper function, availability, and security of our information systems are critical to our business.\u201d\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate Encompass.\nPrior to consummation of the Acquisition, Encompass operated independently of us, with its own business, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. We will in some respects operate our existing business, along with the business of Encompass, as one combined organization, for example utilizing certain common information systems, operating procedures, administrative functions, financial and internal controls and human resources practices. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of Encompass with our business. In addition, Encompass itself has grown through acquisitions, and there may be legacy systems, operating policies and procedures, financial and administrative practices yet to be fully integrated within Encompass. The failure to successfully integrate Encompass with our business could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nReductions or changes to the reimbursement mechanisms from government payors and other legislative and regulatory changes affecting the home health and hospice businesses could adversely affect Encompass\u2019 operating results.\nEncompass derives a substantial portion of its net operating revenues from the Medicare program. As noted above, from time to time legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on the increases and, in some cases, significant roll-backs or reductions, in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs. There can be no assurance future governmental initiatives will not result in pricing roll-backs, freezes or other reimbursement reductions.\nAs discussed in \u201c-Reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third-party payors and other legislative and regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results,\u201d the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have impacted and will in the future continue to impact home health and hospice care providers. For example, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Law directed CMS to improve home health payment accuracy through rebasing home health payments over four years starting in 2014. The rebasing adjustment for calendar year 2015 resulted in an approximately 2.4% reduction to the annual market basket update determined by CMS. In addition, the laws also require an annual home health productivity adjustment beginning on January 1, 2015. For calendar year 2015, that adjustment is a decrease to the market basket update of 50 basis points.\nFor hospice services, the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws require, in addition to the annual productivity adjustment, further reduction of the annual market basket update of 30 basis points for fiscal years 2013 through 2019. The hospice productivity adjustment for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2014 was a decrease to the market basket update of 50 basis points.\nCMS recently hired ABT & Associates to examine and recommend changes to the home health outlier payment calculation methodology. Changes to how the larger outlier payments are calculated could adversely affect Encompass\u2019 revenues with respect to these payments. In addition, in August 2014, MedPAC provided CMS with its comments on CMS\u2019s 2015 home health prospective payment system update, changes to the face-to-face visit requirement, recalibration of the payment weights for home health resource groups, changes to the pay-for reporting program and changes to the value-based purchasing model.\nSpecifically, MedPAC recommended (i) accelerating rebasing cuts and legislative changes to make the cuts larger in size considering the 3.5% reduction will not effectively remove margins, (ii) requiring home health recipients to make copayments for services, (iii) implementing readmission penalties on home health outcomes similar to penalties levied in acute care services, (iv) overhauling the home health prospective payment system to pay providers based on patient characteristics in lieu of the number of services furnished, (v) keeping the physician face-to-face narrative as a requirement in effect for at least another year while CMS considers potential modifications, (vi) CMS analyzing the change in the reported average case-mix to determine whether a payment adjustment is warranted, and (vii) implementing a value-based purchasing demonstration by fiscal year 2016.\nThere can be no assurance these recommendations and initiatives or other future governmental action will not result in substantial changes to home health and hospice operations or material reductions in reimbursements.\nCompetition among home health and hospice service companies is intense.\nThe home health and hospice services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition comes from locally owned private home health companies or acute-care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market to market. We compete with a variety of other companies in providing home health and hospice services, some of which may have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities. Competing companies may offer newer or different services from those we offer or have better relationships with referring physicians and may thereby attract patients who are presently, or would be candidates for, receiving Encompass home health or hospice services.\nSome of Encompass\u2019 current and potential competitors, which include a number of other public companies, have or may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial resources than Encompass has or may obtain. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in most of Encompass\u2019 local markets. Accordingly, other companies, including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing competing services, may expand their services to include home health services, hospice care, community care services, or similar services. Encompass may encounter increased competition in the future that could negatively impact patient referrals to Encompass, limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect Encompass\u2019 profitability.\nBeginning in January 2015, hospice agencies will be required by CMS to complete a Hospice Experience of Care Survey. As part of this new survey, the survey data will be made available to the public when 12 months of data are available. In addition to the likely additional costs associated with implementing and responding to the survey, competing companies may use the disclosed information in their marketing and other strategic materials which could negatively impact patient referrals to Encompass, limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, and adversely affect Encompass\u2019 profitability.\nIf we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe success of home health and hospice providers depends substantially on referrals from physicians, hospitals, case managers and other patient referral sources in the communities served. Referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home care patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers. Our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and operate profitably.\nGiven our intention to expand our presence in home health and hospice, we are subject to risks in a market in which we have limited experience.\nThe majority of our experience has historically been as an owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. An important aspect of the Acquisition was retention of its management team. If we decide to further expand our presence in home health or hospice or other relevant healthcare services, our existing overall business model may change, and we may become subject to risks in a market in which we have limited experience. In most states, home health is regulated by different agencies than those that regulate inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and we have less experience with the agencies that regulate home health. If we decide to expand our presence in home health and hospice, we might have to adjust part of our existing business model, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe rely extensively on the experience and expertise of Encompass\u2019 management team. In order to retain this experience and expertise, we have entered into three-year employment agreements that include noncompetition and other restrictive covenants with certain key senior management personnel of Encompass. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to retain these individuals or other members of Encompass\u2019 management team. If we are unable to retain these members of Encompass\u2019 senior management, we could face increased difficulties in operating Encompass and in expanding our presence in home health and hospice.\nFor additional discussion of risks related to our future growth, see \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-We may have difficulty completing investments and transactions that increase our capacity consistent with our growth strategy,\u201d \u201c-We may make investments or complete transactions that may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities,\u201d and \u201c- Successful execution of our current business plan depends on our key personnel.\u201d\nIf any of Encompass\u2019 home health or hospice programs fail to comply with the Medicare conditions of participation, that program could be terminated from the Medicare program.\nEach of Encompass\u2019 home health and hospice agencies must comply with extensive conditions of participation for certification in the Medicare program. If any of Encompass\u2019 home health or hospice programs fail to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, that program may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state survey agency. If that home health or hospice agency then fails to institute an acceptable plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the applicable correction period, that program could be terminated from receiving Medicare payments. For example, the conditions require that hospice programs have a certain number of volunteers. A program could be terminated from the Medicare benefit if the program fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period. If CMS terminates one program or agency, it may increase its scrutiny of other agencies under common control. Additionally, in October 2014, CMS proposed revisions to the Medicare conditions of participation applicable to home health agencies and intended to provide home health agencies with enhanced flexibility while focusing provider efforts on patient services, quality of care, and quality assessment and performance improvement efforts. More specifically, CMS proposed to establish four new conditions of participation (in addition to retaining current requirements related to comprehensive assessment of patients) for: (1) patient rights; (2) care planning, coordination of services, and quality of care, requiring an interdisciplinary team approach to provide home health services; (3) quality assessment and performance improvement, requiring each home health agency to conduct ongoing quality assessments, incorporate data-driven goals, and maintain an evidence-based performance improvement program of its own design to affect continuing improvement in the quality of patient care; and (4) infection prevention and control. We cannot\npredict when or what, if any, changes will be made or the impact on us. We believe Encompass is in substantial compliance with the conditions of participation; however, we cannot predict how surveyors will interpret all aspects of the Medicare conditions of participation. Any termination of one or more of Encompass\u2019 home health or hospice programs from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the conditions of participation could adversely affect its patient service revenue and profitability and financial condition.\nWe could experience significant malpractice or other similar claims.\nHome care services, by their very nature, are provided in an environment, the patient\u2019s place of residence, that is not in the substantial control of the healthcare provider. Accordingly, home care involves an increased level of associated risk of general and professional liability. On any given day, Encompass has thousands of nurses, therapists and other care providers driving to and from the homes of patients where they deliver care. We cannot predict the impact that any claims arising out of the travel, the home visits or the care being provided, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We also cannot predict the adequacy of any reserves for such losses or recoveries from any insurance or re-insurance policies.\nWe could experience significant increases to our operating costs due to shortages of qualified home health and hospice employees and other healthcare professionals or union activity.\nThe market for qualified home health and hospice employees and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive. Encompass, like other healthcare providers, may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel such as nurses, certified nurse\u2019s assistants, nurse\u2019s aides, therapists, home health and hospice employees and other providers of healthcare services. Encompass\u2019 home health and hospice operations are particularly dependent on nurses and other employees for patient care. As the demand for home health services and hospice services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, home health operators and their competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Any difficulty Encompass may experience in hiring and retaining qualified personnel may increase its average wage rates and may force it to increase its use of contract personnel.\nIn addition, healthcare providers are experiencing a high level of union activity across the country. Encompass currently has no unionized employees. Although we cannot predict the degree to which Encompass will be affected by future union activity, there are continuing legislative proposals that could result in increased union activity. Encompass could experience an increase in labor and other costs from union activity. Furthermore, Encompass could experience a disruption of its operations if its employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage.\nEncompass may experience increases in its labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel. Our inability to adequately manage Encompass\u2019 labor costs may adversely affect our future operating results.\nEncompass\u2019 hospice operations are subject to annual Medicare caps calculated by Medicare and potential changes in the Medicare reimbursement methodology.\nWith respect to Encompass\u2019 hospice operations, overall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number are subject to an inpatient cap amount and an overall payment cap, which are calculated and published by the Medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis covering the period from November 1 through October 31. If payments received under any one of Encompass\u2019 hospice provider numbers exceeds either of these caps, it may be required to reimburse Medicare for payments received in excess of the caps, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. CMS and MedPAC are currently working on amending the timing requirements of refunding overpayments related to hospice payments, which may have an adverse effect on Encompass\u2019 cash flows. In addition, MedPAC has recommended that CMS work to develop an alternative payment system for hospice services. Over the last several years, CMS examined an alternative payment system for hospices (including adding a case-mix adjustment to the system) and found that costs varied at different stages of a hospice stay-with higher costs accruing at the beginning and end of an episode. As a result, CMS is examining adjusting the payment system by implementing a short-stay policy. There can be no assurance the foregoing recommendations will not result in substantial changes to hospice reimbursements Encompass is entitled to receive from Medicare.", "PERMNO": 10693, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "EHC"}
