{"cik": "921557", "company": "REPUBLIC BANCORP INC /KY/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in Republic\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent in its business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information included in this filing. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future. The value or market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and an investor could lose all or part of their investment.\nThere are factors, many beyond the Company\u2019s control, which may significantly change the results or expectations of the Company. Some of these factors are described below, however, many are described in the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 AND THE PUBLIC RESPONSE\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the public\u2019s response to this pandemic present unique risks to the Company\u2019s operations and the markets it serves. The Company\u2019s operations and the markets it serves have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the public\u2019s response to this pandemic. The following are relevant to the Company and its operations:\n\u25cf Adverse Economic Conditions - COVID-19 has significantly disrupted social and economic activity in many areas of the U.S., including areas where the Bank operates. The full impact of these disruptions is currently unknown. Additionally, these disruptions may lead to the impairment of the Company\u2019s intangible assets, including its goodwill and MSRs.\n\u25cf Loan and Credit Losses - COVID-19 has restricted certain businesses, and the Bank\u2019s credit delinquencies and losses may rise steeply due to these restrictions. Specifically, concentrations of credit in certain markets and in certain industries have been, currently are, or may be more susceptible to delinquency and loss.\no Industry Concentrations - The Bank lends to clients in industries that have had their business models upended by the pandemic; e.g., the hospitality and leisure industry. Further economic damage to these clients may leave them unable to repay their debt with the Bank.\no Commercial Real Estate Concentration - The Company maintains a significant level of loans secured by CRE. COVID-19 has driven a remote work environment for many employers and accelerated the trend toward on-line shopping for consumers in the U.S. versus more traditional brick-and-mortar, in-store shopping. As a result, many businesses have publicly stated that they will be downsizing their CRE facilities. This downsizing could have a material negative impact on demand for certain CRE, which in turn could drive down CRE market values. The Bank could incur higher loan losses on its CRE secured loans if CRE market values decline.\no Borrower Accommodations - In immediate response to the pandemic, and in some instances, governmental requirements, the Bank temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions. The Bank also temporarily granted fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for credit card, automobile, mortgage, small business, and personal loan clients. The Bank has resumed some collection activity as permitted by federal and state law, agency guidance, and other requirements. Future governmental actions may extend borrower protections such as eviction moratoriums and borrower-relief programs.\n\u25cf Reliance on Forecasted Information - The Company\u2019s model for estimating credit losses relies on forecasted economic projections. Such projections could be materially inaccurate, with different projections leading to a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\n\u25cf Capital and Liquidity - A prolonged period of economic stress leading to increased borrower defaults and corresponding servicing obligations could substantially weaken the Company\u2019s capital and liquidity. As a result, the Company could lose access to capital markets and could suspend paying dividends.\n\u25cf Cybersecurity - The Company and its third-party service providers have been and may continue to be subject to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks due to the number of employees working remotely.\n\u25cf Reliance on Third Parties - The Company\u2019s third-party service providers may be unable to meet their service level commitments to the Company.\n\u25cf Interconnectedness of Financial Institutions - The Company depends on other financial institutions. Negative events or publicity for other financial institutions may flow to the Bank due the interconnectedness of the financial industry.\n\u25cf Governmental Restrictions on Operations - Certain loan collection efforts, such as loan foreclosures and evictions, have been and may continue to be prohibited by legal or regulatory bodies.\n\u25cf Ability of Key Personnel to Perform Their Duties - Key Company personnel may be personally and directly impacted by COVID-19 and may be unable to perform their duties.\n\u25cf Consumer Behavior - Consumers may behave differently in the aftermath of the pandemic, placing less value on face-to-face interaction. The Bank is a community bank that places high value on personal connection.\n\u25cf Increased Litigation Risk - The Bank may experience an increase in litigation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf Company Reputation - The Company and the Bank\u2019s reputation could be negatively impacted by the public\u2019s perception of how the Company and Bank have operated during the pandemic.\nREPUBLIC PROCESSING GROUP\nThe Company\u2019s lines of business and products not typically associated with traditional banking expose earnings to additional risks and uncertainties. The RPG operations are comprised of two reportable segments: TRS and RCS.\nRPG\u2019s products represent a significant business risk and management believes the Company could be subject to legislative, regulatory, and public pressure to exit or otherwise modify these product lines, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nVarious states and consumer groups have, from time to time, questioned the fairness of the products offered by RPG. In addition, the 2020 election cycle led to a shift in political power within the executive and legislative branches of the federal government in January 2021. Initiatives of the current President and the current Congress, along with actions of the states, governmental agencies, and consumer groups, could result in regulatory, governmental, or legislative action or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company can no longer offer or must substantially alter its RPG products, it will have a material adverse effect on its profits.\nTAX REFUND SOLUTIONS\nThe TRS segment represents a significant operational risk, and if the Bank were unable to properly service this business, it could materially impact earnings. To process its business, the Bank must implement and test new systems, as well as train new employees. The Bank relies heavily on communications and information systems to operate the TRS segment. Any failure, sustained interruption, or breach in security, including the cyber security, of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in client relationship management and other systems. Significant operational problems could also cause a material portion of the Bank\u2019s tax-preparer base to switch to a competitor to process their bank product transactions, significantly reducing the Bank\u2019s revenue without a corresponding decrease in expenses.\nEAs represent a significant credit risk, and if RB&T is unable to collect a significant portion of its EAs, it would materially, negatively impact earnings. There is credit risk associated with an EA because the funds are disbursed to the taxpayer customer prior to RB&T receiving the taxpayer customer\u2019s refund as claimed on the return. Because there is no recourse to the taxpayer customer if the EA is\nnot paid off by the taxpayer customer\u2019s tax refund, RB&T must collect all its payments related to EAs through the refund process. Losses will generally occur on EAs when RB&T does not receive payment due to several reasons, such as IRS revenue protection strategies, including audits of returns, errors in the tax return, tax return fraud and tax debts not previously disclosed to RB&T during its underwriting process. While RB&T\u2019s underwriting during the EA approval process takes these factors into consideration based on prior years\u2019 payment patterns, if the IRS significantly alters its revenue protection strategies, if refund payment patterns for a given tax season meaningfully change, if the federal government fails to timely deliver refunds, or if RB&T is incorrect in its underwriting assumptions, RB&T could experience higher loan loss provisions above those projected. The provision for loan losses is a significant determining factor of the RPG operations\u2019 overall net earnings.\nThe Bank\u2019s EA and RT products represent a significant compliance and regulatory risk, and if RB&T fails to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, it could have a material negative impact on earnings. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters relating to the offering of consumer loan products, such as the EA, and consumer deposit products such as the RT. Failure to comply with disclosure requirements or with laws relating to the permissibility of interest rates and fees charged could have a material negative impact on earnings. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also expose RB&T to civil money penalties and litigation risk, including shareholder actions.\nThe Bank\u2019s EA and RT products represent a significant third-party management risk, and if RB&T\u2019s third-party service providers fail to comply with all the statutory and regulatory requirements for these products or if RB&T fails to properly monitor its third-party service providers offering these products, it could have a material negative impact on earnings. TRS and its third-party service providers operate in a highly regulated environment and deliver products and services that are subject to strict legal and regulatory requirements. Failure by RB&T\u2019s third-party service providers or failure of RB&T to properly monitor the compliance of its third-party service providers with laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties that materially and adversely affect RB&T\u2019s earnings. Such penalties could also include the discontinuance of any or all third-party program manager products and services.\nDue diligence measures implemented by the federal and state governments, which delay the timing of individual tax refund payments or possibly deny those individual payments outright, could present an increased credit risk to the Company. To protect against fraudulent tax returns, the federal government and many state governments have enacted laws and procedures that provide for additional due diligence by the applicable governmental authority prior to issuing an income tax refund. This additional due diligence has generally driven longer periods between the filing of a tax return and the receipt of the corresponding refund. The federal government, specifically as a result of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, mandates that taxpayers filing tax returns with certain characteristics will not receive their corresponding refunds before February 15 each year. These funding delays negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to make mid-season modifications to its EA underwriting model based on then-current year tax refund funding patterns, because the substantial majority of all EAs are traditionally issued prior to February 15. In addition, these enhanced due diligence measures implemented by the federal and state governments could prevent the taxpayer\u2019s refund from being issued altogether. These governmental changes by themselves, or in combination with management\u2019s changes to EA product parameters, could have a material negative impact on the performance of the EA product and therefore on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations if the loss rate on the EA product increases materially.\nChanges to the EA\u2019s product parameters by management could have a material negative impact on the performance of the EA. In response to changes in the legal, regulatory, and competitive environment, management annually reviews and revises the EA\u2019s product parameters. Further changes in EA product parameters do not ensure positive results and could have an overall material negative impact on the performance of the EA and therefore on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant decline in the amount of EITC consumers receive could lead to a significant decline in usage of TRS\u2019s EA and RT tax products. Historically, a substantial number of clients utilizing TRS\u2019s EA and RT products are consumers that are eligible for the EITC when filing their income tax returns. Economic restrictions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic have substantially increased unemployment across the U.S. and many taxpayers did not have tax withheld from their unemployment benefits. These conditions may lead to a decrease in the amount of total EITC they receive. A decrease in the EITC amount could decrease demand for TRS\u2019s RT and EA products. A decrease in the demand for the RT and EA products could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdvance Child Tax Credit payments may have a significant, negative impact on demand for TRS\u2019s EA product. In mid-2021, eligible individuals began receiving periodic advance Child Tax Credit payments from the IRS. These periodic advance payments may lead to lower demand for TRS\u2019s EA product offerings because the majority of TRS\u2019s client base includes households eligible for the Child\nTax Credit. A significant decline in demand for TRS\u2019s products would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic impact (stimulus) payments by governmental agencies may have a significant, negative impact on demand for TRS\u2019s EA product. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental agencies have provided, and may continue to provide, economic support to certain consumers through stimulus payments and other benefits. Additionally, some federal stimulus payments were provided in January 2021 coinciding with the start of TRS\u2019s 2021 EA product offering. Management believes that these stimulus payments, along with a higher national consumer savings rate since the onset of the pandemic, caused lower demand for TRS\u2019s EA product offerings in 2021 because the majority of TRS\u2019s client base included beneficiaries of such stimulus payments. Further government stimulus programs could cause an additional decline in demand for TRS\u2019s products in 2022 and beyond, which would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nEA and RT products are substantially offered through retail tax preparation locations. Usage of retail tax preparation services may be negatively impacted by COVID-19 related health concerns and/or state or local governmental lockdowns. TRS\u2019s EA and RT product offerings are substantially facilitated through third-party brick-and-mortar service providers. Usage of these brick-and-mortar service providers may be negatively impacted by COVID-19 related health concerns and state or local governmental lockdowns driving a decrease in TRS related EA and RT volume. A significant decrease in demand for TRS\u2019s EA and RT products would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nREPUBLIC CREDIT SOLUTIONS\nRCS revenues and earnings are highly concentrated in its line-of-credit products. While the Company expanded its RCS product offerings in 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2021, RCS\u2019s revenues and earnings were concentrated in its line-of-credit products. The discontinuation of these line-of-credit products, or a substantial change in the terms under which these products are offered, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumer loans originated through the RCS segment represent a higher credit risk. Loss rates for some RCS products have consistently been significantly higher than Traditional Bank loss rates for unsecured consumer loans. A material increase in RCS loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and, if such increase in RCS loan charge-offs persisted for an extended period of time, could lead to the discontinuation of the underlying products.\nConsumer installment loans originated for sale through the RCS segment represent a higher risk of loss on sale. RCS originates its installment loan product for sale and sells this product at a loss if the originated loan defaults on its first payment to RCS, which is generally 16 days following the loan\u2019s origination date. A material increase in first payment defaults for RCS installment loans would result in a material increase in these loans being sold at a loss. Such an increase could have a material adverse impact on the program, and if such losses persisted for an extended period of time, it could lead to the discontinuation of the underlying product.\nRCS loans represent a significant compliance and regulatory risk, and if the Company fails to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements it could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s earnings. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters relating to the offering of RCS loans. Changes in the federal or state legislative or regulatory framework governing and failure to comply with laws relating to the permissibility of interest rates and fees charged could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Bank\u2019s RCS products represent a significant third-party management risk, and if RB&T\u2019s third-party service providers fail to comply with all the statutory and regulatory requirements for these products or if RB&T fails to properly monitor its third-party service providers offering these products, it could have a material negative impact on earnings. RCS and its third-party service providers operate in a highly regulated environment and deliver products and services that are subject to strict legal and regulatory requirements. Failure by RB&T\u2019s third-party service providers or failure of RB&T to properly monitor the compliance of its third- party service providers with laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties that materially and adversely affect RB&T\u2019s earnings.\nWAREHOUSE LENDING\nThe Warehouse Lending business is subject to numerous risks that may result in losses. Risks associated with warehouse loans include, without limitation, (i) credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from the Bank, including but not limited to bankruptcy, (ii) the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of such mortgage bankers and their third-party service providers, (iii) changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker during the time in warehouse, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under a warehouse line of credit, or (iv) unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated, which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker. Failure to mitigate these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s financial statements and results of operations.\nOutstanding Warehouse lines of credit and their corresponding earnings could decline due to several factors, such as intense industry competition, declining mortgage demand, and a rising interest rate environment. With the rise of inflation during the latter half of 2021, the FOMC has signaled a more aggressive and hawkish approach to its monetary policies over the next few years. Included in its expected actions is raising the FFTR multiple times, ending its quantitative easing program of buying certain types of bonds in the open market, and implementing a quantitative tightening program by reducing the size of its balance sheet and selling certain types of bonds in the market.\nThe FOMC\u2019s signaling of these actions caused market interest rates for U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgages to begin to rise rapidly during the last quarter of 2021 and the first few weeks of 2022. With the rise in mortgage rates, mortgage refinance activity began to slow dramatically late in the fourth quarter of 2021, and as a result, Warehouse usage began to decline significantly. Further monetary tightening by the FOMC in 2022 will likely further decrease mortgage demand and Warehouse line usage. In addition, a decrease in usage across the Warehouse industry could also cause competitive pricing pressure on the Bank to lower its pricing to its Warehouse clients in order to maintain higher volumes.\nThe Bank will likely experience decreased earnings on its Warehouse lines of credit during 2022 due to expected rising market interest rates and strong industry competition and pricing pressures. Such decreased earnings could materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company may lose Warehouse clients due to mergers and acquisitions in the industry. The Bank\u2019s Warehouse clients are primarily mortgage companies across the United States. Mergers and acquisitions affecting such clients may lead to an end to the client relationship with the Bank. The loss of a significant number of clients may materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nTRADITIONAL BANK LENDING AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS\nThe ACLL could be insufficient to cover the Bank\u2019s actual loan losses. The Bank makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans. In determining the amount of the ACLL, among other things, the Bank reviews its loss and delinquency experience, economic conditions, etc. If its assumptions are incorrect, the ACLL may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions to its ACLL. In addition, regulatory agencies periodically review the ACLL and may require the Bank to increase its Provision or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in the ACLL or loan charge-offs would have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDeterioration in the quality of the Traditional Banking loan portfolio may result in additional charge-offs, which would adversely impact the Bank\u2019s operating results. When borrowers default on their loan obligations, it may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses associated with the increased allocation of management time and resources associated with the collection efforts. In certain situations where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable \u201cwork-out\u201d arrangements cannot be reached or performed, the Bank may charge-off loans, either in part or in whole. Additional charge-offs will adversely affect the Bank\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nMortgage Banking revenue will likely decline due to declining mortgage demand resulting from a rising interest rate environment, which will also lead to more intense industry competition for a shrinking mortgage market. Mortgage Banking is a significant operating segment of the Company. With the rise of inflation during the latter half of 2021, the FOMC has signaled a more aggressive\nand hawkish approach to its monetary policies over the next few years. Included in its expected actions is raising the FFTR multiple times, ending its quantitative easing program of buying certain types of bonds in the open market, and implementing a quantitative tightening program by reducing the size of its balance sheet and selling certain types of bonds in the market.\nThe FOMC\u2019s signaling of these actions caused market interest rates for treasury bonds and mortgages to begin to rise rapidly during the last quarter of 2021 and the first few weeks of 2022. With the rise in mortgage rates, mortgage refinance activity began to slow dramatically late in the fourth quarter of 2021, and as a result, mortgage origination volume began to decline significantly. Further monetary tightening by the FOMC in 2022 will likely further decrease mortgage demand. In addition, a decrease in mortgage demand across the mortgage industry could also cause competitive pricing pressure on the Bank to lower its mortgage pricing to maintain its volumes for a shrinking market, further causing its cash gains-as-a-percentage-of-loans-sold to decline.\nThe Bank will likely experience decreased Mortgage Banking revenue during 2022 due to expected rising market interest rates and strong industry competition and pricing pressures. Such decreased earnings could materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nLoans originated through the Bank\u2019s Consumer Direct channel will subject the Bank to credit and regulatory risks that the Bank does not have through its historical origination channels. The dollar volume of loans originated through the Bank\u2019s Consumer Direct channel is expected to be increasingly out-of-market. Loans originated out of the Bank\u2019s market footprint inherently carry additional credit and regulatory risk, as the Bank will experience an increase in the complexity of the customer authentication requirements for such loans. Failure to appropriately identify the end-borrower for such loans could lead to fraud losses. Failure to appropriately identify the end-borrower could also result in regulatory sanctions resulting from failure to comply with various customer identification regulations. Failure to appropriately manage these additional risks could lead to additional regulatory and compliance risks and burdens and reduced profitability and/or operating losses through this origination channel.\nThe Bank is highly dependent upon programs administered by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Bank\u2019s ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends significantly on programs administered by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. These entities play powerful roles in the residential mortgage industry, and the Bank has significant business relationships with them. The Bank\u2019s status as an approved seller/servicer for both is subject to compliance with their selling and servicing guides.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction or material change in, the operation of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae would likely prevent the Bank from originating and selling most, if not all, of its mortgage loan originations.\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and earnings could be negatively impacted to the extent the Bank relies on borrower information that is false, misleading, or inaccurate. The Bank relies on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by vendors, clients, and other parties in deciding whether to extend credit and/or enter transactions with other parties. If the Bank relies on incomplete and/or inaccurate information, the Bank may incur additional charge-offs that adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nThe Bank\u2019s use of appraisals as part of the decision process to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral. As part of the decision process to make a loan secured by real property, the Bank generally requires an independent third-party appraisal of the real property. An appraisal, however, is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. An error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of the appraisal. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, the Bank may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan. Additional charge-offs will adversely affect the Bank\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Bank is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title. In the course of its business, the Bank may own or foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Bank is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, the Bank may be subject to\ncommon law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect the Bank.\nPrepayment of loans may negatively impact the Bank\u2019s business. The Bank\u2019s clients may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within the Bank clients\u2019 discretion. If clients prepay the principal amount of their loans, and the Bank is unable to lend those funds to other clients or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, the Bank\u2019s interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income would have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY\nMortgage Banking activities could be adversely impacted by increasing or stagnant long-term interest rates. The Company is unable to predict changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates can impact the gain on sale of loans, loan origination fees, and loan servicing fees, which account for a significant portion of Mortgage Banking income. A decline in market interest rates generally results in higher demand for mortgage products, while an increase in rates generally results in reduced demand. Generally, if demand increases, Mortgage Banking income will be positively impacted by more gains on sale; however, the valuation of existing mortgage servicing rights will decrease and may result in a significant impairment. A decline in demand for Mortgage Banking products resulting from rising interest rates could also adversely impact other programs/products such as home equity lending, title insurance commissions, and service charges on deposit accounts.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability. The Bank\u2019s asset/liability management strategy may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition. The Bank\u2019s primary source of income is from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The Bank expects to periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to the Bank\u2019s position, earnings may be negatively affected.\nA flattening or inversion of the interest rate yield curve may reduce profitability. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve,\u201d or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates, could reduce the Bank\u2019s net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because the Bank\u2019s interest-bearing liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than its interest-earning assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, the Bank\u2019s net interest margin could decrease as its cost of funds rises higher and at a faster pace than the yield on its interest-earning assets. A rise in the Bank\u2019s cost of interest-bearing liabilities without a corresponding increase in the yield on its interest-earning assets, would have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s net interest margin and overall results of operations.\nThe Bank may be compelled to offer market-leading interest rates to maintain sufficient funding and liquidity levels. The Bank has traditionally relied on client deposits, brokered deposits, and advances from the FHLB to fund operations. Such traditional sources may be unavailable, limited, or insufficient in the future. If the Bank were to lose a significant funding source, such as a few major depositors, or if any of its lines of credit were cancelled or curtailed, such as its borrowing line at the FHLB, or if the Bank cannot obtain brokered deposits, the Bank may be compelled to offer market-leading interest rates to meet its funding and liquidity needs. Obtaining funds at market-leading interest rates may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income and overall results of operations.\nThe planned discontinuance of LIBOR presents risks to the Company because the Bank uses LIBOR as a reference rate for a material portion of its financial instruments. In July 2017, the FCA, the authority regulating LIBOR, along with various other regulatory bodies, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021. Subsequent to that announcement, in November 2020, the FCA announced that many tenors of LIBOR would continue to be published through June 2023. In compliance with regulatory guidance, the Bank discontinued referencing LIBOR for new financial instruments during 2021 and chose SOFR to be its primary alternative reference rate for most transaction types upon the discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR.\nRisks associated with the Bank\u2019s transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other alternative reference rates include the following:\n\u25cf SOFR is viewed as a near risk free rate because it is derived from rates on overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase transactions. These transactions are essentially overnight loans secured by U.S. Treasury securities, thus practically risk free. Changing to\nSOFR or a similar rate could result in a value transfer between contracting parties to instruments originally based on LIBOR. Historically, in periods of economic or financial industry stress, near risk free rates that are analogous to SOFR have been relatively stable. In contrast, LIBOR, which is designed to reflect the credit risk of banks, has widened relative to near risk free rates, reflecting increased uncertainty regarding the credit-worthiness of banks. Accordingly, assuming that SOFR will behave like its historical equivalents, an instrument that transitions from LIBOR to SOFR may not yield identical economic outcomes for each contracting party to an instrument had the instrument continued to reference LIBOR. Similarly, SOFR, because it is near risk free, tends to be a lower rate than LIBOR. To address these differences between LIBOR and SOFR, certain industry recommended LIBOR fallback provisions include a concept of an adjustment spread that is applied when a LIBOR-based contract transitions to SOFR and that is calculated based on a five-year median look-back of the historical spot difference between the applicable LIBOR tenor and the applicable SOFR tenor. However, because any such adjustment spread will be based on a historical median, it is likely that the adjustment spread may not reflect the spot difference between LIBOR and SOFR at certain points in time and there may be a value transfer between the contracting parties over the life of the instrument because the all-in rate applied to a contract, even taking into account the spread adjustment, might have behaved differently over the life of the instrument in the absence of LIBOR cessation.\nAny value transfer could be financially adverse to the Bank or to its counterparties. Repercussions from a change in reference rate would likely include changes to the yield on, and value of, loans or securities held by the Bank, and amounts received and paid on derivative instruments the Bank has contracted. Any theoretical benefit to the Bank could result in counterparty dissatisfaction, which, in turn could lead to litigation, potentially as class actions, or other adverse consequences, including dissatisfied clients or counterparties, resulting in loss of business. As a result, over the life of a transaction that transitions from LIBOR to a new reference rate, the Bank\u2019s obligations to its counterparties or vice versa and the yield the Bank contractually receives or pays may change from that which would have resulted from a continuation of LIBOR.\n\u25cf As of December 31, 2021, approximately $445 million of Bank loans were indexed to LIBOR and scheduled to mature after June 30, 2023. Contractual fallback/transition language within these LIBOR-based contracts may be deemed ambiguous or inadequate and may result in litigation, and in some cases may involve concession on the Bank\u2019s part that has the effect of reducing the value of the instrument to the Bank.\nAdditionally, the Bank\u2019s LIBOR-based interest rate derivative contracts executed prior to January 25, 2021 may not include adequate \u201cfallback\u201d language to use alternative indexes and margins when LIBOR ceases. In response, the industry trade group for derivatives, ISDA, published a protocol pursuant to which industry participants can agree with any other industry participant that adheres to the protocol to include ISDA\u2019s new LIBOR fallback provisions into legacy derivatives contracts. Although the Bank has adhered to the ISDA protocol, it is possible that many \u201cend users\u201d of swaps, i.e., Bank loan clients who have hedged their interest rate payment obligations, may not adhere. In addition, there are differences between the new ISDA fallback provisions and the fallback provisions that have been proposed for loans, which differences could result in a mismatch between the reference rate or other economics in Bank borrowers\u2019 legacy derivative contracts and their loans for which such derivative contracts are intended as a hedge. For these end-user counterparties, one-on-one negotiation with each counterparty will be necessary in order to amend legacy swaps to adequately address LIBOR cessation. If the Bank is unable to agree to appropriate LIBOR cessation provisions with these swap counterparties, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect the Bank\u2019s rights and obligations under its legacy swap contracts. Although legislative solutions to address LIBOR cessation in derivative contracts have been proposed, there is no assurance such solutions will be implemented, and the Bank may seek to negotiate with impacted counterparties or, if not possible, effect reference rate transition through other means. Addressing transition under these circumstances may be challenging or ineffective, could result in litigation, and in some cases may involve concession on the Bank\u2019s part that has the effect of reducing the value of the instrument to the Bank.\n\u25cf Transitioning from LIBOR to alternative indexes may result in operational errors during the transition such that the replacement index is not applied in a timely manner or is incorrectly applied. This is particularly true given the volume of contracts that will require transition, the variety of potential approaches to transition, and the possible short duration of the transition period.\nIt is also possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to the currently anticipated cessation date. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time for preparing for the transition.\nThe Bank\u2019s failure to successfully implement the transition from LIBOR to alternative indexes could result in reduced interest income on its loans that reprice with LIBOR, and/or increased regulatory scrutiny and actions by regulators, including fines and other supervisory sanctions.\nDEPOSITS AND RELATED ITEMS\nClients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing the Bank to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing superior expected returns. If clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, the Bank could lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing its funding costs and negatively impacting its overall results of operations.\nThe loss of large deposit relationships could increase the Bank\u2019s funding costs. The Bank has several large deposit relationships that do not require collateral; therefore, cash from these accounts can generally be utilized to fund the loan portfolio. If any of these balances are moved from the Bank, the Bank would likely utilize overnight borrowing lines on a short-term basis to replace the balances. The overall cost of gathering brokered deposits and/or FHLB advances, however, could be substantially higher than the Traditional Bank deposits they replace, increasing the Bank\u2019s funding costs and reducing the Bank\u2019s overall results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s \u201cOverdraft Honor\u201d program represents a significant business risk, and if the Bank terminated the program, it would materially impact the earnings of the Bank. There can be no assurance that Congress, the Bank\u2019s regulators, or others, will not impose additional limitations on this program or prohibit the Bank from offering the program. The Bank\u2019s \u201cOverdraft Honor\u201d program permits eligible clients to overdraft their checking accounts up to a predetermined dollar amount for the Bank\u2019s customary overdraft fee(s). Limitations or adverse modifications to this program, either voluntary or involuntary, would significantly reduce net income.\nCOMPANY COMMON STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s common stock generally has a low average daily trading volume, which limits a stockholder\u2019s ability to quickly accumulate or quickly sell large numbers of shares of Republic\u2019s stock without causing wide price fluctuations. Republic\u2019s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, as detailed in the next risk factor. A low average daily stock trading volume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to several factors, including those discussed below. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that may cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf Variations in the Company\u2019s and its competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated quarterly or annual fluctuations in operating results, cash flows, and financial condition;\n\u25cf Changes in earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to the Bank or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf Announcements by the Company or its competitors of mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships;\n\u25cf Additions or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf The announced exiting of or significant reductions in material lines of business within the Company;\n\u25cf Changes or proposed changes in banking laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations;\n\u25cf Events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf Developments relating to regulatory examinations;\n\u25cf Speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to the Company\u2019s reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf Future issuances or re-sales of equity or equity-related securities, or the perception that they may occur;\n\u25cf General conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u25cf Domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance;\n\u25cf Developments related to litigation or threatened litigation;\n\u25cf The presence or absence of short selling of the Company\u2019s common stock; and,\n\u25cf Future sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or debt securities.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, has historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This is due, in part, to investors\u2019 shifting perceptions of the effect of changes and potential changes in the economy on various industry sectors. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their performance or prospects. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, notwithstanding its actual or anticipated operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate due to many factors, including prevailing interest rates, other economic conditions, operating performance, and investor perceptions of the outlook for the Company specifically and the banking industry in general. There can be no assurance about the level of the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock in the future or that you will be able to resell your shares at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe Company\u2019s insiders hold voting rights that give them significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval. The Company\u2019s Executive Chair/CEO and Vice Chair hold substantial voting authority over the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote and each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten votes. This group generally votes together on matters presented to stockholders for approval. These actions may include, for example, the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to corporate documents, the approval of mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, and the continuation of the Company as a registered company with obligations to file periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. Consequently, other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence Company actions through their vote may be limited and the non-insider stockholders may not have sufficient voting power to approve a change in control even if a significant premium is being offered for their shares. Majority stockholders may not vote their shares in accordance with minority stockholder interests.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock is not an insured deposit. The Company\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Company\u2019s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION / ECONOMIC FACTORS\nThe Company is significantly impacted by the regulatory, fiscal, and monetary policies of federal and state governments that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s liquidity position and earnings. These policies can materially affect the value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments and can also adversely affect the Company\u2019s clients and their ability to repay their outstanding loans. In addition, failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or adverse examination findings, could result in significant penalties, negatively impact operations, or result in other sanctions against the Company. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine, in large part, the Company\u2019s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return the Company earns on these loans and investments, all of which impact net interest margin.\nThe Company and the Bank are heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels and are subject to various routine and non-routine examinations by federal and state regulators. This regulatory oversight is primarily intended to protect depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system, not the stockholders of the Company. Changes in policies, regulations and statutes, or the interpretation thereof, could significantly impact the product offerings of Republic causing the Company to terminate or modify its product offerings in a manner that could materially adversely affect the earnings of the Company.\nFederal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible non-banking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. Various federal and state regulatory agencies possess cease and desist powers, and other authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulations. The FRB possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These, and other restrictions, can limit in varying degrees, the way Republic conducts its business.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions, including but not limited to those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition, and earnings. Enacted financial reform legislation has changed and will continue to change the bank regulatory framework. Ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the effect of new legislation and regulatory actions in response to these conditions, may adversely affect Company operations by restricting business activities, including the Company\u2019s ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These measures are likely to increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business and may have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s lending activities, financial performance, and operating flexibility. In addition, these risks could affect the performance and value of the Company\u2019s loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect financial performance.\nThe Company may be subject to examinations by taxing authorities that could adversely affect results of operations. In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to examinations from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments it has made and the businesses in which the Company is engaged. Federal and state taxing authorities have continued to be aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, they could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMANAGEMENT, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ACQUISITIONS, ETC.\nThe Company is dependent upon the services of key qualified personnel. The Company is dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of its key management personnel who have substantial experience with Company operations, the financial services industry, and the markets in which the Company offers services. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or more of its key personnel would have an adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be impacted if its third-party service providers experience difficulty. The Company depends on several relationships with third-party service providers, including core systems processing and web hosting. These providers are well-established vendors that provide these services to a significant number of financial institutions. If these third-party service providers experience difficulty or terminate their services and the Company is unable to replace them with other providers, its operations could be interrupted, which would adversely impact its business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations, including third-party and client interactions, are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased the risks related to cyber security. The Company is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Management has observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks may be carried out directly against the Company, or against the Company\u2019s clients or vendors by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. While the Company has not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, the Bank may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if the Bank, the Bank\u2019s clients, or one of the Bank\u2019s third-party service providers fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include: remediation costs for stolen assets or information; system repairs; consumer protection costs; increased cyber security protection costs that may include organizational changes; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from\nunauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract clients following an attack; litigation and payment of damages; and reputational damage adversely affecting client or investor confidence.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the impact of the failure or interruption of information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrences of any failures or interruptions of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks. From time to time, the Company may develop and grow new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. All service offerings, including current offerings and those that may be provided in the future, may become riskier due to changes in economic, competitive, and market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect earnings. Reputational risk is the risk to Company operations from negative public opinion. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived way the Company conducts its business activities, including product offerings, sales practices, practices used in origination and servicing operations, the management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues, and the Company\u2019s protection of confidential client information. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to keep and attract clients and can expose the Company to litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully complete acquisitions will affect its ability to grow and compete effectively in its market footprint. The Company has announced plans to pursue a policy of growth through acquisitions to supplement internal growth. The Company\u2019s efforts to acquire other financial institutions and financial service companies or branches may not be successful. Numerous potential acquirers exist for many acquisition candidates, creating intense competition, which affects the purchase price for which the institution can be acquired. In many cases, the Company\u2019s competitors have significantly greater resources than the Company has, and greater flexibility to structure the consideration for the transaction. The Company may also not be the successful bidder in acquisition opportunities that it pursues due to the willingness or ability of other potential acquirers to propose a higher purchase price or more attractive terms and conditions than the Company is willing or able to propose. The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in its market footprint. The risks presented by the acquisition of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSuccessful Company acquisitions present many risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. An institution that the Company acquires may have unknown asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities that the Company did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process, thereby resulting in unanticipated losses. The acquisition of other institutions also typically requires the integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution, to make the transaction economically advantageous. The integration process is complicated and time consuming and could divert the Company\u2019s attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to its clients and the clients of the acquired institution. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in the loss of key clients and employees and prevent the Company from achieving expected synergies and cost savings. Acquisitions and failed acquisitions also result in professional fees and may result in creating\ngoodwill that could become impaired, thereby requiring the Company to recognize further charges. The Company may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s leverage and reducing liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nREPUBLIC INSURANCE SERVICES, INC.\nTransactions between the Company and its insurance subsidiary, the Captive, may be subject to certain IRS responsibilities and penalties. The Company\u2019s Captive is a Nevada-based, wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of the Company that provides property and casualty insurance coverage to the Company and the Bank as well as a group of other third-party insurance captives for which insurance may not be available or economically feasible. The Treasury Department of the United States and the IRS by way of Notice 2016-66 have stated that transactions believed similar in nature to transactions between the Company and the Captive may be deemed \u201ctransactions of interest\u201d because such transactions may have potential for tax avoidance or evasion. If the IRS ultimately concludes such transactions do create tax avoidance or evasion issues, the Company could be subject to the payment of penalties and interest.\nBANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE\nThe Bank holds a significant amount of BOLI, which creates credit risk relative to the insurers and liquidity risk relative to the product. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank held BOLI on certain employees. The eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of the various insurance companies to pay death benefits or to return the cash surrender value to the Bank if needed for liquidity purposes. The Bank continually monitors the financial strength of the various insurance companies that carry these policies. However, any one of these companies could experience a decline in financial strength, which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return the Bank\u2019s cash surrender value. If the Bank needs to liquidate these policies for liquidity purposes, it would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value and penalties for early termination, both of which would adversely impact earnings.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES/ESTIMATES\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and estimates are critical components of the Company\u2019s presentation of its financial statements. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates. Actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. Management has identified certain accounting policies and estimates as being critical to the presentation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These policies are described in Part II Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d The Company\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many accounting policies and methods to comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management may select an accounting policy that might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the Company\u2019s reporting different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates.\nThe Bank may experience goodwill impairment, which could reduce its earnings. The Bank performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 as of September 30, 2021. The evaluation of the fair value of goodwill requires management judgment. If management\u2019s judgment was incorrect and goodwill impairment was later deemed to exist, the Bank would be required to write down its goodwill resulting in a charge to earnings, which could materially, adversely affect its results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86287, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RBCAA"}
