These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe have incurred losses since inception, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nWe expect that we will need additional funding before we can become profitable from any potential future sales of cytisinicline. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may be unable to complete the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent upon a single company for the manufacture and supply of cytisinicline.\n\u2022\nCytisinicline is currently our sole product candidate and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and commercialize cytisinicline.\n\u2022\nThe development of our product candidate is dependent upon securing sufficient quantities of cytisinicline from trees and other plants, which grows outside of the United States in a limited number of locations.\n\u2022\nIf we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and/or other countries, we will not be able to sell cytisinicline.\n\u2022\nIt is difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future prospects and forecast our financial performance and growth.\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our business, including our non-clinical development activities and planned clinical trials.\n\u2022\nWe expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture cytisinicline for use in clinical trials, and we intend to exclusively rely on Sopharma to produce and process cytisinicline, if approved, which may be impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including the possibility of expanded regional or global conflict and related economic sanctions.\n\u2022\nOur commercialization of cytisinicline could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if Sopharma fails to obtain approval of government regulators, fails to provide us with sufficient quantities of product, or fails to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\n\u2022\nSopharma may breach its supply agreement with us and sell cytisinicline into our territories or permit third parties to export cytisinicline into our territories and negatively affect our commercialization efforts of our products in our territories.\n\u2022\nWe face substantial competition, and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\n\u2022\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to cytisinicline, product compounds and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other periodic and current reports and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This list is not exhaustive, and the order of presentation does not reflect management's determination of priority or likelihood.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred losses since inception, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical development-stage specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history, are not profitable, have incurred losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future.\nPharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop cytisinicline, including providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible promissory notes. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or grants.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We further expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue the clinical development of cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nadvance cytisinicline development into larger, more expensive clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninitiate additional non-clinical, clinical, or other trials or studies for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nseek to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nundertake the manufacturing of cytisinicline or increase volumes manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nmake milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license and/or supply agreements;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product for which we may obtain marketing approval and market for ourselves;\n\u2022\nseek to discover, identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to establish, maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with the development and potential for regulatory approval of cytisinicline such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned studies, additional major studies, or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nWe expect that we will need additional funding before we can become profitable from any potential future sales of cytisinicline. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may be unable to complete the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have expended and continue to expend substantial funds in connection with our product development activities and clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, cytisinicline and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval.\nFunds generated from our operations will be insufficient to enable us to bring all of our products currently under development to commercialization. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations from the sale of our securities, debt, partnering arrangements, non-dilutive fundraising or other financing transactions in order to finance the commercialization of our product candidate. The current financing environment in the United States, particularly for biotechnology companies like us, is exceptionally challenging and we can provide no assurances as to when such an environment will improve. Further, the uncertainty with respect to our operations and the market generally due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also make it challenging to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all. For these reasons, among others, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when and as needed or, if available, that it will be available on acceptable terms. If financing is available, it may be on terms that adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. If adequate financing is not available, we may need to continue to reduce or eliminate our expenditures for research and development of cytisinicline, and may be required to suspend development of cytisinicline. Our actual capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour commercialization activities and arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nthe progress of our non-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights with respect to our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes and developments in our existing collaborative, licensing and other relationships;\n\u2022\nthe effect of interest rate increases, which may increase the cost of our borrowing under our loan facility, which includes an adjustable-rate component; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of any new collaborative, licensing, commercialization and other arrangements that we may establish.\nWe may not be able to secure sufficient financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize cytisinicline. We do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncompleting research and development of cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing product and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially feasible, satisfy regulatory requirements and meet our supply needs in sufficient quantities to satisfy market demand for cytisinicline, if approved;\n\u2022\nmarketing, launching and commercializing any product for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022\nobtaining reimbursement or pricing for cytisinicline that supports profitability;\n\u2022\ngaining market acceptance of cytisinicline as a treatment option;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing products, including the potential for generic cytisinicline products;\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, if any, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, commercialization, or other arrangements into which we may enter; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if a product candidate that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing that candidate. Additionally, if we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of any approved products to cover our operating costs, we may never become profitable. If we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidate may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidate in those markets.\nWe are dependent upon a single company for the manufacture and supply of cytisinicline.\nOur single product candidate, cytisinicline, has been in-licensed from a third party. We are required to continue to contract with Sopharma AD, or Sopharma, to continue our development of, and potential commercialization of, cytisinicline pursuant to a supply agreement with Sopharma. Sopharma currently manufactures all of its cytisinicline API in its facilities in Bulgaria. The conflict in Ukraine, including the possibility of expanded regional or global conflict and related economic sanctions, may have negative impacts on Sopharma\u2019s business, which could cause them to reduce or terminate investments in the cytisincline program. If the supply agreement with Sopharma is terminated, we will need to develop or acquire alternative supply and manufacturing capabilities for cytisinicline, which we may not be able to do on commercially viable terms or at all.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidate Cytisinicline\nCytisinicline is currently our sole product candidate and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and commercialize cytisinicline.\nWe are currently dependent on the potential development of a single product candidate, cytisinicline. We are still developing our sole product candidate, and cytisinicline cannot be marketed or sold in the United States or in foreign markets until regulatory approval has been obtained from the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive and time consuming. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may never approve cytisinicline for sale and marketing, and even if cytisinicline is ultimately approved, regulatory approval may be delayed or limited in the United States or in other jurisdictions. Even if we are authorized to sell and market cytisinicline in one or more markets, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully market cytisinicline or that cytisinicline will achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate profits. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize cytisinicline due to failure to obtain regulatory approval for cytisinicline, to successfully market cytisinicline, to generate profits from the sale of cytisinicline, or due to other risk factors outlined in this report, it would have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations as cytisinicline is currently our sole product candidate.\nResults of earlier clinical trials of cytisinicline are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any advances of cytisinicline into clinical trials may not have favorable results or receive regulatory approval.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will be consistent with the results of the earlier clinical trials of cytisinicline. Positive results in non-clinical testing and past clinical trials with respect to the safety and efficacy of cytisinicline do not ensure that results from subsequent clinical trials will also be positive, and we cannot be sure that the results of subsequent clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and non-clinical testing. Any such failure may cause us to abandon cytisinicline, which would negatively affect our ability to generate any product revenues.\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trial will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\nfailure to permit the conduct of a clinical trial by regulatory authorities, after review of an investigational new drug or equivalent foreign application or amendment;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting qualified patients in its clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to perform in accordance with the good clinical practices requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our supply chain for the cytisinicline required for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatients terminating enrollment in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to continue to conduct research and development due to adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nadverse events or tolerability issues significant enough for the FDA or other regulatory agencies to put any or all clinical trials on hold;\n\u2022\ninability to generate satisfactory non-clinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data or diagnostics to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nanimal toxicology issues significant enough for the FDA or other regulatory agencies to disallow investigation in humans;\n\u2022\noccurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in ongoing or other planned indications for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of impurities in our cytisinicline drug product, such as nitrosamines, above the regulators\u2019 prescribed thresholds; and\n\u2022\ndelays in the manufacture or packaging of sufficient quantities of cytisinicline for use in clinical trials.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for cytisinicline could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to cytisinicline, we may need to conduct additional non-clinical trials or the results obtained from such new formulation may not be consistent with previous results obtained. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize cytisinicline and may harm our business and results of operations.\nCytisinicline may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval, limit the commercial viability of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by cytisinicline could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or terminate clinical trials or even if approved, result in a restrictive label or delay regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities.\nAdditionally, even if cytisinicline receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by cytisinicline, potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the cytisinicline label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of cytisinicline, even if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe development of our product candidate is dependent upon securing sufficient quantities of cytisinicline from trees and other plants, which grows outside of the United States in a limited number of locations.\nThe therapeutic component of our product candidate, cytisinicline, is derived from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides trees and other plants, which grows in the mountains of Southern Europe and other limited locations around the world. We currently secure cytisinicline exclusively from Sopharma, a Bulgarian third-party supplier. Our current supply agreement with Sopharma expires on July 28, 2037, unless extended by mutual agreement of us and Sopharma. There can be no assurances that Laburnum anagyroides trees and other plants will continue to grow in sufficient quantities to meet commercial supply requirements or that the countries from which we can secure them will continue to allow the exportation of cytisinicline. For example, Laburnum anagyroides trees take approximately four to six years to reach maturity for harvesting and have a productive life expectancy of 20 to 25 years. There is no guarantee that Sopharma will plant sufficient trees or secure sufficient quantities of cytisinicline drug product to manage supply for our markets or to meet our forecasts. Additionally, economic or political instability or disruptions, such as the conflict in Ukraine, could negatively affect our supply chain or increase our costs. If these types of events or disruptions continue to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event we are no longer able to obtain cytisinicline from Sopharma, or in sufficient quantities, we may not be able to produce our proposed products and our business will be adversely affected.\nOur product development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take cytisinicline or our other product candidates may experience. The number of subjects exposed to cytisinicline or our other product candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance findings, that may only be detected once the product is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. We cannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of cytisinicline will be uncovered. Such rare and severe side effects may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to cytisinicline or over a significantly longer period of time. If such safety problems occur or are identified after cytisinicline reaches the market in the United States, or if such safety problems occur or are identified in foreign markets where cytisinicline is currently marketed, the FDA may require that we amend the labeling of cytisinicline or recall it, or may even withdraw approval for cytisinicline.\nIf the use or misuse of cytisinicline harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to cytisinicline, our regulatory approvals, if any, could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of cytisinicline in clinical trials and the sale of cytisinicline if marketing approval is obtained, exposes us to the risk of potential product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product. There is a risk that cytisinicline may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, during the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events for reasons that may be related to cytisinicline. Such\nevents could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market cytisinicline, if any, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which an adverse event is unrelated to cytisinicline, an investigation into such circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. Such investigations may delay our regulatory approval process or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals cytisinicline receives or maintains. As a result, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we obtain marketing approval for cytisinicline, we will need to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. We cannot know if we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage.\nWhere we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may also bring a product liability claim against us alleging that cytisinicline causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites or limitations on approved indications;\n\u2022\nan inability to commercialize, or if commercialized, a decreased demand for, cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nif commercialized, product recalls, withdrawals of labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions or the need for product modification;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue, if any;\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;\n\u2022\nincreased product liability insurance rates, or inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products and our technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be negatively affected by weather conditions, natural disasters, and the availability of natural resources, as well as by climate change.\nIn recent years, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns such as storms, flooding, drought, and temperature changes appear to have become more common. The production of cytisinicline from the Laburnum anagyroides and other plant depends on the availability of natural resources, including sufficient rainfall. Our exclusive supplier of cytisinicline, Sopharma, could be adversely affected if it experiences a shortage of fresh water due to droughts or if it experiences other adverse weather conditions. The long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are unclear and may heighten or intensify existing risk of natural disasters. As a result of such events, we could experience cytisinicline shortages from Sopharma, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the manufacturing and other operations of Sopharma are located near earthquake fault lines in Sofia, Bulgaria. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions from the disruption of our cytisinicline supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may conduct clinical trials internationally, which may trigger additional risks.\nIf we decide to conduct clinical trials in Europe or other countries outside of the United States, we will have additional regulatory requirements that we will have to meet in connection with our manufacturing, distribution, use of data and other matters. Failure to meet such regulatory requirements could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of cytisinicline by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or the commercialization of cytisinicline, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with some programs or product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. We may also enter into additional strategic collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize some of our programs and potential product candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaborations, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Cytisinicline and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and/or other countries, we will not be able to sell cytisinicline.\nWe will need approval from the FDA to commercialize cytisinicline in the United States and approvals from similar regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize cytisinicline in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of cytisinicline, we must submit an NDA to the FDA, demonstrating that cytisinicline is safe, pure and potent, and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research including completion of clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cytisinicline or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in data that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications of cytisinicline. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our applications. We may never obtain regulatory approval for cytisinicline. Failure to obtain approval from the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize cytisinicline will leave us without saleable products and therefore without any source of revenues. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product or permit continued marketing, if previously approved. If conditional marketing approval is obtained, the results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. In foreign jurisdictions, the regulatory approval processes generally include the same or similar risks as those associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot be certain that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize cytisinicline for sale either within or outside the United States.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for cytisinicline, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements in connection with the sale and distribution of cytisinicline.\nEven if cytisinicline is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials, and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-approval information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and the requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Compliance with such regulatory requirements will likely be costly and the failure to comply would likely result in penalties, up to and including, the loss of such approvals from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to continuously comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current cGMP regulations and corresponding foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements. As such, we, Sopharma and other contract manufacturers, if any, will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA or marketing authorization application.\nOngoing post-approval monitoring and clinical trial obligations may be costly to us and the failure to meet such obligations may result in the withdrawal of such approvals.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for cytisinicline, if any, may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which cytisinicline may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of cytisinicline. We will be required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing product safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. If our original marketing approval for cytisinicline was obtained through an accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing clinical trial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nrequire a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law would be expected to require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate adverse publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products and the value of us and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for cytisinicline and begin commercializing it in the United States, our operations may be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Healthcare Reform Law requires manufacturers of products, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including governmental and private payors, to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Healthcare Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Healthcare Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and its results of operations.\nHealthcare legislative and executive reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Healthcare Reform Law was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Law, among other things, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of specified branded prescription products, and promotes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.\nThere have also been multiple recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and adopted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. In addition, Congress and multiple presidential administrations have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. We anticipate that additional state and federal healthcare measures could be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for cytisinicline, or additional pricing pressures. Currently, the Healthcare Reform Law provides coverage for smoking cessation-related activities, including two counseling attempts for smoking cessation per year and medications for smoking cessation. If these provisions are repealed, in whole or in part, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nFurther, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly known as Brexit). Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from the regulations of the European Union, Brexit could materially change the regulatory framework applicable to the approval of cytisinicline, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. Brexit may also result in other significant regulatory and legislative changes in the United Kingdom, which could, for example, affect the pricing of pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom, which could in turn result in diminished performance for us. Even if the substance of regulatory changes resulting from Brexit does not have a significant impact on our operations, it is reasonable to expect that we would incur potentially significant costs in connection with complying with any new regulations.\nBrexit may also have adverse effects on potential customers and collaborators of ours, which could indirectly have an adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to obtain services, reimbursement or funding may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending in the United States as well as globally.\nU.S. federal government agencies currently face potentially significant spending reductions. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, the failure of Congress to enact deficit reduction measures of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggered automatic cuts to most federal programs. These cuts would include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 1, 2013, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. The full impact on our business of these automatic cuts is uncertain.\nIf government spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop. Any reductions in government spending in countries outside the United States may also impact us negatively, such as by limiting the functioning of international regulatory agencies in countries outside the United States or by eliminating programs on which we may rely.\nIn July 2021, we announced that we were awarded a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to evaluate the use of cytisinicline as a treatment for cessation of nicotine e-cigarette use. This initial grant award, in the amount of $320,000, commenced on August 1, 2021, and is being utilized to complete critical regulatory and clinical operational activities, such as protocol finalization, clinical trial site identification, and submission of a new IND to the FDA for investigating cytisinicline in nicotine e-cigarette users. Upon completion of these milestones, as assessed by the NIH and subject to available funding, we expect to receive the next stage of the grant award of approximately $2.5 million, which will enable initiation of the Phase 2 ORCA-V1 clinical study evaluating cytisinicline in approximately 150 adult nicotine e-cigarette users in the United States.\nThe full grant award of $2.8 million is expected to cover approximately half of the ORCA-V1 clinical study costs. If amounts allocated to federal grants were reduced or eliminated, we would be required to fund the shortfall in the ORCA-V1 clinical study costs, which may result in delay of initiation of or cancellation of the study.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, or CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, or CROs, which could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws, provide accurate information to the FDA, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Further, even if we are successful in asserting a defense, we may incur substantial costs in preparing and maintaining our defense and any such action would be time- and resource-intensive and potentially divert management\u2019s attention from the business, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nIt is difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future prospects and forecast our financial performance and growth.\nTo date our business activities have been focused primarily on the development and regulatory approval of cytisinicline and its various alternative forms. Although we have not generated revenue to date, we expect that, after any regulatory approval, any receipt of revenue will be attributable to sales of cytisinicline, primarily in the United States, the European Union (including the United Kingdom) and Asia. Because we devote substantially all of our resources to the development of cytisinicline and rely on cytisinicline as our sole source of potential revenue for the foreseeable future, any factors that negatively impact this product, or result in decreasing product sales, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development and other resources in order to successfully pursue our development and commercialization efforts for our existing and future product candidates. We expect to need additional scientific, technical, operational, financial and other personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, such as management, clinical and preclinical personnel, including our executive chairman Richard Stewart and our executive officers John Bencich, Cindy Jacobs, Anthony Clarke and Jaime Xinos. In addition, although we have entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Stewart, Mr. Bencich, Dr. Jacobs, Dr. Clarke and Ms. Xinos, such agreements permit those executives to terminate their employment with us at any time, subject to providing us with advance written notice.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, if at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in development and commercialization of cytisinicline may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of the services of our current personnel may impede the progress of our research, development, and commercialization objectives and would negatively impact our ability to succeed in our product development strategy.\nWe will need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe may need to expand our organization, which may require us to divert a disproportionate amount of our attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in its infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Expanded growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability\nto commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nIn the future, we may invest in the development of additional indications for cytisinicline. If we invest in and are unsuccessful in developing additional indications for cytisinicline, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may invest in the research and development of new indications for cytisinicline to address nicotine addictions associated with the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Given their recent introduction, the use of vaping products is not fully understood which may increase the risk of failure in this area. We are considering potential clinical studies in users of e-cigarettes and have been awarded a grant by the NIH to pursue the initial feasibility of this development. In order to obtain NIH funding to support reimbursement of clinical study costs, the NIH will need to determine that certain milestones under the current award have been achieved. There is no guarantee that we will achieve these milestones or that the NIH agree with our assessment to provide future funding. Even if we successfully achieve these milestones, future grant funding under the award will still be subject to availability of funds at the NIH, and such funding will not be sufficient to cover the full clinical costs of the planned Phase 2 trial. We expect that we will need to invest significant amounts of capital complete the planned Phase 2 trial and pursue development of an e-cigarette cessation indication. If we are unable to provide such additional capital when needed, we may be unable to complete the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of an e-cigarette cessation indication.\nThe development of additional indications for cytisinicline is highly uncertain. During the research and development cycle, we may expend significant time and resources on developing additional indications without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of additional indications, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. Further, any new indications may not be accepted by physicians and the medical community at large, and competitors may develop and market equivalent or superior products. Failure to launch commercially successful new indications for cytisinicline after significant investment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our non-clinical development activities and planned clinical trials.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar pandemics, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, manufacturing, non-clinical development activities, non-clinical studies and planned clinical trials, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or disruptions in non-clinical development activities, including non-clinical experiments and investigational new drug application-enabling good laboratory practice standard toxicology studies due to unforeseen circumstances in supply chain;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact timelines for regulatory submission, trial initiation and regulatory approval;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays in our CROs and collaborators meeting expected deadlines or complying with regulatory requirements related to non-clinical development activities, non-clinical studies and planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruptions of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidate from Sopharma due to staffing shortages, productions slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in any planned clinical site initiation, including difficulties in obtaining IRB approvals, recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nincreased adverse events or rates of patients withdrawing from any planned clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19 or being forced to quarantine;\n\u2022\nlower efficacy rates due to diminished patient motivations, increased patient stress, inability to attend behavioral counseling sessions or patients withdrawing from clinical trials as a result of contracting COVID-19 or being forced to quarantine;\n\u2022\ninterruption of planned key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and planned clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee or collaborator resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our non-clinical development activities, non-clinical studies and ongoing or planned clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, an increased reliance on working from home or mass transit disruptions; and\n\u2022\nreduced ability to engage with the medical and investor communities due to the cancellation of conferences scheduled throughout the year.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen as the pandemic continues, which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct non-clinical development activities, non-clinical studies and planned clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results. With respect to our ORCA-2 clinical trial, we have experienced delays in enrollment. We may in the future experience more significant delays in enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis that could materially adversely impact our business, timing of trial results, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies, as well as the broader equity and debt markets, have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on economic activity. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital when needed, and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms to us. Further, to the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be diluted.\nThe extent to which the pandemic may impact our business, manufacturing, non-clinical development activities, non-clinical studies and planned clinical trials and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and actions to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nFor example, in March 2020, the FDA halted most field inspections of biopharmaceutical facilities and clinical research sites due to travel and contact restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has restricted the FDA\u2019s ability to perform facilities inspection and has resulted in the delay for the approval of new products. Increasing delay of approvals by the FDA could have a significant negative effect on our business, including the timing of any proposed interactions with the FDA related to any NDA filing and or new product approval.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party collaborators or other service providers, may fail or suffer security breaches and cyber attacks, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs.\nWe believe that we take reasonable steps that are designed to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store, and disclose, but inadvertent or unauthorized data access may occur despite our efforts. For example, our system protections may be ineffective or inadequate, or we could be impacted by software bugs or other technical malfunctions, as well as employee error or malfeasance. Additionally, privacy and data protection laws are evolving, and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data handling safeguards and practices that could result in fines, lawsuits, and other penalties, and significant changes to our or our third-party collaborators or service providers business practices and products and service offerings. To the extent that the measures we or our third-party collaborators or service providers have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations, or regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties, damages, harm to our reputation, or loss of customers. While we have not experienced any material losses as a result of any system failure, accident or security breach to date, we have been the subject of certain phishing attempts in the past. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. Additionally, a party who circumvents our security measures could, among other effects, appropriate patient information or other proprietary data, cause interruptions in our operations, or expose our collaborators to hacks, viruses, and other disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events may not be adequate to cover all potential losses. The development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nTo the extent that any disruption, security breach, or cyber attack were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our patient data, we may also have obligations to notify patients and regulators about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to credit monitoring services, pay significant fines to one or more regulators, or pay compensation in connection with a class-action settlement (including under the new private right of action under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which is expected to increase security breach litigation). Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises customer data. Additionally, the financial exposure from the events referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we may maintain, and there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture cytisinicline for use in clinical trials, and we intend to exclusively rely on Sopharma to produce and process cytisinicline, if approved. Our commercialization of cytisinicline could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if Sopharma fails to obtain approval of government regulators, fails to provide us with sufficient quantities of product, or fails to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have nor do we currently plan to develop the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture cytisinicline on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently exclusively rely on Sopharma to manufacture cytisinicline for use in clinical trials and plan to continue relying on Sopharma to manufacture cytisinicline on a commercial scale, if approved.\nOur reliance on Sopharma exposes us to the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nSopharma might be unable to timely manufacture cytisinicline or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify manufacturers other than Sopharma on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nSopharma may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately;\n\u2022\nSopharma may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products;\n\u2022\nSopharma is or will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over Sopharma\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u2022\nwe may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by Sopharma in the manufacturing process for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nwe do not own all the intellectual property rights to cytisinicline, and Sopharma could license such rights to third parties or begin supplying other third parties with cytisinicline; and\n\u2022\nSopharma could breach or terminate their agreement with us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any of cytisinicline by the FDA or the commercialization of cytisinicline or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to package the cytisinicline used in our clinical trials. If any of these CMO\u2019s fail to timely deliver supplies needed then our clinical studies could be delayed materially. Third-party manufacturers may fail to perform under their contractual obligations, or may fail to deliver the required commercial product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. If we are required to identify and qualify an alternate manufacturer, we may be forced to delay or suspend our clinical trials. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future.\nThe manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in the supply of cytisinicline or in the Sopharma manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot be assured that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of cytisinicline will not occur in the future. Additionally, Sopharma may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or political instability in the countries in which Sopharma conducts its operations. For example, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and hinder our ability to find the materials we need to make our product candidate. If Sopharma were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with its contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials could be delayed or suspended. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Similar political instability could also harm the commercial production and supply of cytisinicline in the event that cytisinicline is ultimately approved for commercial sale.\nIn June 2021, Pfizer Inc. halted the distribution of its smoking cessation drug, Chantix (varenicline), after heightened levels, above the FDA\u2019s acceptable daily intake limit, of nitrosamines were found in some lots of Chantix pills. In September 2021, Pfizer announced a nationwide recall in the United States of all lots of Chantix and have also withdrawn the product in other countries around the globe. If contaminants, or impurities such as nitrosamines, are discovered in quantities above regulators\u2019 thresholds within our supply of cytisinicline, we may need to halt our clinical trials for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination or impurity, which may potentially delay product development and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform other services. If these third parties do not successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize cytisinicline and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe plan to rely upon third-party CROs to conduct, monitor and manage our ongoing clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of clinical trials and manage and control only some aspects of their activities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, including those required by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, the results generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be assured that our CROs and other vendors will meet these requirements, or that upon inspection by any regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that efforts, including any of our clinical trials, comply with applicable requirements. Our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and guidelines may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would be costly and delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs in a timely manner or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs may not prioritize our clinical trials relative to those of other customers and any turnover in personnel or delays in the allocation of CRO employees by the CRO may negatively affect our clinical trials. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, continued development of cytisinicline may be delayed or terminated and we may not be able to meet our current plans with respect to cytisinicline. CROs may also involve higher costs than anticipated, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop or potentially commercialize cytisinicline.\nOur business plan relies heavily on third party collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations, clinical investigators, vendors or other third parties to support our research and development efforts and to conduct clinical trials for cytisinicline. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for, or maintain relationships with, these third parties on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. If we fail to establish or maintain such third-party relationships as anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaborations which we may enter into with other companies for the development and commercialization of cytisinicline.\nWe may enter into a collaboration with third parties concerning the development and/or commercialization of cytisinicline; however, there is no guarantee that any such collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncollaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of cytisinicline;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\nany such collaboration may significantly limit our share of potential future profits from the associated program, and may require us to relinquish potentially valuable rights to cytisinicline, or other potential products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of cytisinicline if the collaborators view cytisinicline as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of cytisinicline, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\nthe collaborations may not result in us achieving revenues to justify such transactions; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of cytisinicline.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of cytisinicline.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from our or our sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to our collaboration agreements, we indemnify our collaborators from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right by a third party. With respect to consultants, we indemnify them from claims arising from the good faith performance of their services.\nShould our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any of our current or future product candidates that we commercialize, including services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize any of our current or future product candidates will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of any of our current or future product candidates, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers may provide key services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, and cash collection, and, as a result, most of our inventory may be stored at a single warehouse maintained by one such service provider. If we retain a service provider, we would substantially rely on it as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired and we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nIn addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other services for us relating to adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, or these third parties otherwise fail to comply with regulatory requirements related to adverse event reporting, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nAdditionally, if a third-party errs in calculating government pricing information from transactional data in our financial records, it could impact our discount and rebate liability and potentially cause government programs to overpay providers for our products, which could expose us to significant False Claims Act liability and other civil monetary penalties.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Cytisinicline\nWe face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to cytisinicline and the other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We are aware that many companies have therapeutics marketed or in development for smoking cessation, including Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Merck & Co., Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Embera Neurotherapeutics, Inc., 22nd Century Group, Inc., Quit4Good, zpharm, NAL Pharmaceuticals, , Omeros, , Adamed, Aflofarm, Axsome, Amygdala, Antidote Therapeutics, NFL Biosciences, Currax, Palisades Therapeutics, Ro and others.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, name recognition, manufacturing, marketing, research, technical and other resources than us. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Further, our competitors may develop new products that are safer, more effective or more cost-efficient than cytisinicline. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in non-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for products. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Failure of cytisinicline to effectively compete against established treatment options or in the future with new products currently in development would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of cytisinicline will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement or insurance coverage for products, if any, could limit our ability to market cytisinicline and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nEven with the approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of cytisinicline will depend in part on the healthcare providers, patients, and third-party payors accepting cytisinicline as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Cytisinicline may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors. The degree of market acceptance of cytisinicline will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy, if any, of cytisinicline as demonstrated in clinical trials and potential advantages over competing treatments, if any;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which approval is granted, if any, including any limitations or warnings contained in cytisinicline\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment;\n\u2022\nthe perceived ratio of risk and benefit of these therapies by physicians and the willingness of physicians to recommend the product to patients based on such risks and benefits;\n\u2022\nthe marketing, sales and distribution support for cytisinicline;\n\u2022\nthe publicity concerning cytisinicline or competing products and treatments;\n\u2022\nthe pricing and availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nnegative perceptions or experiences with our competitor\u2019s products may be ascribed to cytisinicline; and\n\u2022\navailability of cytisinicline from other suppliers and/or distributors.\nEven if cytisinicline displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile upon approval, market acceptance of cytisinicline remains uncertain. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of cytisinicline, if any, may require significant investment and resources and may never be successful. Additionally, third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, may also encourage the use of generic products instead of cytisinicline, or a generic version of cytisinicline, which require a prescription or may be available OTC. If our products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and other healthcare providers, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nThe pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of cytisinicline, if any, must be sufficient to support our commercial efforts and other development programs and the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including\ngovernmental and private insurers, are essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of cytisinicline, if any, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of cytisinicline will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or government payors and private payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited amounts, we may have to subsidize or provide cytisinicline for free or we may not be able to successfully commercialize cytisinicline.\nIn addition, there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel product candidates such as cytisinicline and what reimbursement codes cytisinicline may receive if approved.\nOutside the United States, selling operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of products. In many countries, the prices of products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our products, if any. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the potential revenue may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and private payors in the United States and abroad to limit or reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of cytisinicline, if any, may be more difficult to achieve even if regulatory approval is received.\nSopharma may breach its supply agreement with us and sell cytisinicline into our territories or permit third parties to export cytisinicline into our territories and negatively affect our commercialization efforts of our products in our territories.\nWe are currently dependent on the exclusivity provisions of our supply agreement with Sopharma to conduct our business and to prevent Sopharma from competing, directly and indirectly, with us in the United States and Western Europe. If Sopharma were to breach the exclusivity provisions of the supply agreement with us and sell or distribute cytisinicline directly into our territories or permit third parties to export cytisinicline into our territories, among other things, the increase in competition within our anticipated markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of cytisinicline, stolen products, or alternative third-party distribution and sale of cytisinicline could have a negative impact on our financial performance or reputation.\nCytisinicline is not patentable in the United States as it is a naturally occurring substance. As such, third parties are able to manufacture, sell or distribute cytisinicline without royalties or other payments to us and compete with our products in the United States and potentially worldwide and negatively impact our commercialization efforts of our products. We are aware of additional cytisinicline products approved in several European countries and we may not be able to block other third parties from launching generic versions of cytisinicline. Third parties may also sell or distribute cytisinicline as an herbal or homeopathic product. Other than regulatory exclusivity or other limitations, there may be little to nothing to stop these third parties from manufacturing, selling or distributing cytisinicline. Because we have no ability to set rigorous safety standards or control processes over third party manufacturers, sellers or distributors of cytisinicline, excluding Sopharma, these formulations of cytisinicline may be unsafe or cause adverse effects to patients and negatively impact the reputation of cytisinicline as a safe and effective smoking cessation aid.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of cytisinicline, especially on online marketplaces, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards under cGMP. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and may even be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or no active pharmaceutical ingredients at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit products, increased levels of counterfeiting, or unsafe cytisinicline products could materially affect patient confidence in our cytisinicline product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit or other non-Achieve cytisinicline products will mistakenly be attributed to our cytisinicline product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation, and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity in cytisinicline as a result of\ncounterfeiting, theft, or improper manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIt is illegal to sell unapproved prescription medicines in the United States. Sopharma\u2019s cytisinicline brand is currently approved for sale in certain Central and Eastern European countries. Cytisinicline has not yet received a marketing approval from the FDA and we intend to conduct the requisite clinical trials to obtain approval for the marketing of cytisinicline in the United States and in major global markets. We are aware that products purporting to be Sopharma\u2019s cytisinicline brand are available, via third party internet sites, for importation in the United States and other global markets. We have no control over the authenticity of products purchased through these sites, which may be counterfeit or sourced from distributors in Central and Eastern Europe without authorization to sell into the United States or European Union.\nWe may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to cytisinicline, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may attempt to form strategic collaborations, create joint ventures or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic collaboration for cytisinicline on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. This may be because cytisinicline may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the competitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, or cytisinicline\u2019s patent protection insufficient, and/or third parties may not view cytisinicline as having sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nAny delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop and/or commercialize cytisinicline could delay the development or commercialization of cytisinicline, which may reduce our competitiveness even if we reach the market. Absent a strategic collaborator, we would need to undertake development and/or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development and/or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our product candidate cytisinicline or bring it to market and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in any efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on clinical testing, approval, and potential commercialization of cytisinicline, our sole product candidate, the success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nour potential product candidates may not succeed in non-clinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022\nour potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our potential product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\npotential product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a potential product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na potential product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na potential product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to cytisinicline, product compounds and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently, we have rights to intellectual property through trade secrets, licenses, patents from third parties, and patents and applications that we own. Our product candidate may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective proprietary rights for our product candidate or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our proposed markets.\nWe currently rely primarily on trade secret protection and on confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Trade secrets can be difficult to protect, however, and even where they are protected they generally provide less intellectual property protection to the holder of the trade secret than to a holder of a patent. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe are currently developing cytisinicline for smoking cessation. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patent rights of third parties. We are not aware of any patents or patent applications that would prevent the development, manufacture or marketing of cytisinicline for smoking cessation.\nWe are aware of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties that cover certain other therapeutic uses of cytisinicline. We are currently monitoring these patents and patent applications. We may in the future pursue available\nproceedings in the U.S. and foreign patent offices to challenge the validity of these patents and patent applications. In addition, or alternatively, we may consider whether to seek to negotiate a license of rights to technology covered by one or more of such patents and patent applications for these certain additional therapeutic uses. If any third-party patents or patent applications cover our product candidates or technologies in other therapeutic uses, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates for additional therapeutic uses, absent such a license, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to specified limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our product candidates or the use of our product candidates.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidate. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidate may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe intend to rely on patent rights for certain aspects of our product candidates and certain future product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain an adequate proprietary position from this approach, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nAlthough we rely or will rely primarily on trade secret protection as part of our intellectual property rights strategies, we also intend to rely on patent rights to protect certain aspects of our technologies and upon the patent rights of third parties from which we license certain of our technologies.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United Kingdom, United States and certain other countries around the world related to future product candidates. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or at all. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsolved. The patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patent applications or our patents (once issued) have been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our future product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our future product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other\npatents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any future product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a future product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain effective protection of exclusivity from our regulatory efforts and intellectual property rights, including patent protection or data exclusivity, for our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nObtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained, if any. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIn Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to naturally occurring substances are not patentable. Cytisinicline is a naturally occurring product and is not patentable. Our intellectual property strategy involves novel formulations of cytisinicline and there is no guarantee that such patents will be issued or if issued, will be broad enough to prevent competitors from developing competing cytisinicline products. Although we do not believe that any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications directed at our product candidate, if issued in their currently pending forms, as well as patent rights licensed by us, will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patent rights. There could be similar changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions that may impact the value of our patent rights or our other intellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we have written agreements and make every effort to ensure that our employees, consultants, and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or intellectual property rights of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to any claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and as a result we may not be able to ensure their protection. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan and will eventually expire.\nMarket exclusivity awarded by the FDA upon the approval of an NDA is limited in scope and duration. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and defending against third-party challenges, patent and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire, as well as the related manufacturing methods. We will be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that the technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, should we enter into additional collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement of our patent applications and patents. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to\ndate in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents and patent applications or in third-party patents and patent applications. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Moreover, the patent application process is also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting any of our current or future product candidates that we may develop, license, or acquire by obtaining and defending patents. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to conceive of and reduce to practice the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that none of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nthe issued patents may not cover commercially viable active products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\npatents of others may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nnoncompliance with requirements of governmental patent agencies can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction, potentially allowing competitors to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u2022\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates; or\n\u2022\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of available patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In most countries, including the United States, the expiration of a patent is typically 20 years from the date that the application for the patent is filed. Various extensions of patent term may be available in particular countries; however, in all circumstances the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, has a limited term. If we encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product under patent protection could be reduced. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. Such possible extensions include those permitted under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 in the United States, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years to cover an FDA-approved product. The actual length of the extension will depend on the amount of patent term lost while the product was in clinical trials. However, the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data, and then may be able to launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other governmental fees on patents or patent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various patent agencies\noutside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ and rely on reputable law firms and other professionals to effect payment of these fees to the USPTO and non-U.S. patent agencies for the patents and patent applications we own and those that we in-license. We also employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with the various documentary and other procedural requirements with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own and those that we in-license. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents, our in-licensed patents, or other intellectual property that we own or in-license. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part; construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly; or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources than we do. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nWe or our licensors may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patent applications and patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price for our common stock is volatile.\nThe market prices for our common stock and that of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital, the terms of such capital, and our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe ability of us or our partners to develop cytisinicline and other product candidates and conduct clinical trials that demonstrate such product candidates are safe and effective;\n\u2022\nthe ability of us or our partners to obtain regulatory approvals for cytisinicline or other product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy, receive regulatory approval and achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our existing third-party license, manufacturing and supply agreements;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our candidates;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new or competing products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including intellectual property or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nif securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business and stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical conditions, including the current global economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasingly volatile global economic conditions resulting from the conflict in Ukraine;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to our markets generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u2022\ntweets or other social media posts related to our market and industry.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. An increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, may be the sole source of gain from an investment in our common stock. An investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for investors who require dividend income. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for stockholders for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, an investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for investors who require dividend income or investors who are not prepared to bear a significant risk of losses from such an investment.\nThe sale of additional shares of common stock pursuant to our existing equity sale agreements or the conversion of our convertible debt into shares of common stock, may cause the price of our common stock to decline and result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn September 2017 we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or LPC, which was amended in March 2020, pursuant to which we have the right, from time to time, in our sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to direct LPC to purchase additional shares of common stock having an aggregate value of approximately $10.0 million and we have exercised this right. We have directed LPC to purchase additional shares and may further direct LPC to purchase additional shares as often as every business day over the 54-month term of the Purchase Agreement in increments of up to 7,500 shares of common stock. The purchase price of shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement have been and will be based on prevailing market prices of common stock at the time of sale without any fixed discount, and we have controlled and will control the timing and amount of any sales of common stock to LPC. In addition, we have directed and we may direct LPC in the future to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an At-the-Market Offering Sales Agreement, or ATM, with Virtu Americas, LLC, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may sell shares of common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $25 million. Also in December 2021, we entered into a $25.0 million contingent convertible debt agreement, or Debt Agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and SVB Innovation Credit Fund VIII, L.P., or, together with SVB, the Lenders. As part of the contingent convertible debt agreement, the Lenders funded $15.0 million in the form of convertible indebtedness, or Convertible Debt, at closing. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Lenders may convert all or any part of the outstanding Convertible Debt and accrued and unpaid interest at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $9.34 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Additionally, all outstanding Convertible Debt, including accrued and unpaid interest, will mandatorily convert into shares of our common stock, at the conversion price, on such date, if any, when the closing price per share of our common stock has been equal to or greater than $24.00 for 30 consecutive trading days prior to such date.\nThe sale of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with LPC or our ATM, or the conversion of the Convertible Debt into shares of our common stock, would have a dilutive impact on our existing stockholders. Sales by us to LPC, or under the ATM, or the conversion of the Convertible Debt, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Sales of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement, or the ATM, the conversion of the Convertible Debt or the perception that such events will occur, could also encourage short sales by third parties, which could contribute to the further decline of the price of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement or ATM, the conversion of the Convertible Debt or the perception that such events will occur, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish.\nBecause our merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code for OncoGenex, pre-merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are now subject to limitations.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our 2017 merger involving OncoGenex and Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. resulted in an ownership change for OncoGenex and, accordingly, OncoGenex\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations on their use after the merger. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on the combined organization\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business, or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over the equity research analysts that provide research coverage of our common stock or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrades our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, including in circumstances where such declines occur in close proximity to the announcement of clinical trial results. Additionally, our stock price and those of other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Capital Market. These rules and regulations impose significant legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nIf we raise additional capital, the terms of the financing transactions may cause dilution to existing stockholders or contain terms that are not favorable to us.\nIn the future, we plan to raise additional capital through private placements or public offerings of our equity or debt securities. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional financing by issuing equity securities, we may do so at a price per share that represents a discount to the then-current per share trading price of our common stock and our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nBecause we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and\nour directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nU.S. federal tax reform and changes in other tax laws could increase our tax burden and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, significantly reforming the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate.\nIn addition, beginning in 2022, the recently enacted tax legislation will require research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the United States must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.\nNotwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the enacted federal tax law or any newly enacted federal legislation. In addition, new legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any governmental authority. We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Additionally, we use our best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations. However, a challenge by a taxing authority, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 82526, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACHV"}
