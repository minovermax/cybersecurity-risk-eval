{"cik": "839470", "company": "URANIUM RESOURCES INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming URI will continue as a going concern. This assumes continuing operations and the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.\nWe have incurred significant losses since ceasing production in 2009 and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and expenses related to maintaining our properties and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $8.9 million, cash of approximately $0.9 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $217.3 million. As a result, we have included a discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern in our consolidated financial statements, and our auditor\u2019s report for year ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Our capital needs have, in recent years, been funded through sales of our debt and equity securities. In the event that we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, long-term prospects and ability to continue as a viable business.\nDefaults under our secured loan agreement with RCF may result in RCF talking possession and disposing of any collateral, and restrictions under the secured loan agreement may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business.\nOur $8.0 million loan agreement with RCF matures on December 31, 2016, and we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or to refinance it. Our obligations under the loan agreement are secured by pledges of the equity interests of our subsidiaries and a lien on substantially all of our assets, and if we default on our obligations under the loan agreement, among other remedies, RCF could take possession and dispose of any collateral under the loan agreement and related documents, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Even if we are able to obtain new financing upon a default under the loan agreement, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIn addition, the loan agreement contains certain restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from, among other things:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npaying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmaking investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreating liens;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nguaranteeing indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under our loan agreement with RCF and payment of the indebtedness could be accelerated. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or to refinance it. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nURI is not producing uranium at this time. As a result, we currently have no sources of operating cash. If we cannot monetize certain existing assets, partner with another company that has cash resources, find other means of generating revenue other than uranium production and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business.\nAs a result of low uranium prices, we ceased production of uranium in 2009. While we have approximately 664,000 pounds of reserves at our South Texas properties, we are not planning to commence production at any of our South Texas properties until we are able to acquire additional reserves or mineralized material and uranium prices recover to levels that will ensure that production, once resumed, is sustainable in the 300,000 to 500,000 pound range per year. Our ability to begin plant construction and wellfield development in Turkey and New Mexico is subject to availability of financing and activation of our permits and licenses. In addition, in the event the sale to Laramide Resources is not completed, we expect that we will need to secure significant capital for the development of our Churchrock project in advance of beginning development activities on the project. We do not have a committed source of financing for the development of our Temrezli or Churchrock project. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing for these projects or our other projects. Our inability to develop the Temrezli or our other properties would have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nUntil we begin uranium production, we have no way to generate cash inflows unless we monetize certain of our assets or through financing activities. Our future uranium production, cash flow and income are dependent upon the results of exploration as well as our ability to bring on new, as yet unidentified wellfields and to acquire and develop additional reserves. We can provide no assurance that our properties will be placed into production or that we will be able to continue to find, develop, acquire and finance additional reserves. If we cannot monetize certain existing assets, partner with another company that has cash resources, find other means of generating revenue other than uranium production and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business and our stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nOur ability to function as an operating mining company will be dependent on our ability to mine our properties at a profit sufficient to finance further mining activities and for the acquisition and development of additional properties. The volatility of uranium prices makes long-range planning uncertain and raising capital difficult.\nOur ability to operate on a positive cash flow basis will be dependent on mining sufficient quantities of uranium at a profit sufficient to finance our operations and for the acquisition and development of additional mining properties. Any profit will necessarily be dependent upon, and affected by, the long and short term market prices of uranium, which are subject to significant fluctuation. Uranium prices have been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the demand for nuclear power, political and economic conditions in uranium producing and consuming countries, uranium supply from secondary sources and uranium production levels and costs of production. A significant, sustained drop in uranium prices may make it impossible to operate URI\u2019s business at a level that will permit us to cover our fixed costs or to remain in operation.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital, our business may fail and stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nWe had approximately $0.9 million in cash at December 31, 2015 and $0.3 million at March 11, 2016. On average, URI expended approximately $1.1 million of cash per month during 2015 (excluding costs related to the Anatolia Transaction of approximately $3.0 million), which is expected to decrease to $0.9 million per month during 2016. There can be no assurance that URI will be able to obtain additional capital after it exhausts its current cash. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would likely result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we borrow money, we will have to pay interest and may also have to agree to restrictions that limit our operating flexibility.\nIf additional capital is not available in sufficient amounts or on a timely basis, URI will experience liquidity problems, and URI could face the need to significantly curtail current operations, change our planned business strategies and pursue other remedial measures. Any curtailment of business operations would have a material negative effect on operating results, the value of our outstanding stock is likely to fall, and our business may fail, causing our stockholders to lose their entire investment.\nOur foreign operations subject us to a number of significant regulatory and legal risks that may have a material adverse impact on our prospects, projects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of Anatolia Energy significantly increased the importance of foreign operations to our future prospects and growth, and our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks. These risks include such things as:\n\u2022\nenforcement of unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate, mineral tenure, contract, water use, mine safety and environmental laws and policies;\n\u2022\nchallenges to mining, processing and related permits and licenses, or to applications for permits and licenses, by or on behalf of regulatory authorities, indigenous populations, non-governmental organizations or other third parties;\n\u2022\nwar, crime, terrorism, sabotage, civil unrest and uncertain political and economic environments;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation, nullification or forced modification of existing contracts, licenses, permits, approvals, concessions or the like;\n\u2022\ncorruption;\n\u2022\nchallenges in overseeing employees and contractors, including the risk that our employees and independent contractors may engage in unauthorized or illegal activity;\n\u2022\nexchange and currency controls and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on foreign exchange and repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mineral production and price controls;\n\u2022\nseizure of mineral production and expropriation or nationalization of property;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation, including changes related to taxation, new or increased mining royalty interests, import and export regulations, foreign ownership, foreign trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation; and\n\u2022\nlabor practices and disputes.\nIn addition, we face the numerous risks as a new acquirer that our expectations may not be realized and that we may encounter unexpected problems. After the closing of the Anatolia Transaction, we have begun to review Anatolia Energy\u2019s operations in Turkey, including compliance with local laws and applicable permitting requirements. In the event we determine material noncompliance, we could face fines or restrictions on our ability to develop our projects in Turkey, which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, projects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, regulatory, permitting and business arrangements in foreign jurisdictions are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent improper payments, fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business arrangements that are commonplace in such foreign jurisdictions, and violations of such laws and regulations could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties.\nThe benefits of integrating URI and Anatolia Energy may not be realized.\nTo be successful on a going forward basis, we will need to combine and integrate the operations of URI and Anatolia Energy into one company. Integration will require substantial management attention and could detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. We could encounter difficulties in the integration process, such as the need to revisit assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs, including synergies, the loss of key employees or commercial relationships or the need to address unanticipated liabilities. If we cannot integrate URI\u2019s and Anatolia Energy\u2019s businesses successfully, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the Anatolia Transaction.\nThe market price of URI\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Anatolia Transaction.\nThe market price of URI\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Anatolia Transaction if the integration of Anatolia Energy\u2019s business is unsuccessful, the perceived benefits of the Anatolia Transaction are not achieved as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or the effect of the Anatolia Transaction on the combined company\u2019s financial results after the completion of the Anatolia Transaction is not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.\nThe Anatolia Transaction is expected to result in an ownership change for URI under Section 382 of the Code, potentially limiting the use of URI\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in future years. In addition, URI\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2015, URI had approximately $219.2 million of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards available to reduce U.S. federal taxable income in future years. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its postchange income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.\nThe Anatolia Transaction is expected to result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code for URI, potentially limiting the use of URI\u2019s NOL carryforwards in future taxable years for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These limitations may affect the timing of when these NOL carryforwards can be used which, in turn, may impact the timing of when cash is used to pay the taxes of URI and have a negative impact on URI\u2019s financial position and results of operations. In addition, URI\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will be dependent on its ability to generate taxable income. Some portion of the NOL carryforwards could expire before URI generates sufficient taxable income.\nApproximately 18.0% of our common stock is beneficially owned by a significant stockholder.\nAs of March 18, 2016, approximately 13.9% of our common stock is owned by Resource Capital Fund V L.P. (\u201cRCF\u201d). In addition, under the terms of the RCF loan agreement, RCF has the right to acquire an additional 256,410 shares of our common stock upon conversion of the $8.0 million currently drawn under a loan agreement between RCF and URI, which would increase RCF\u2019s ownership to approximately 18.0% of our common stock. In addition, under a stockholders\u2019 agreement between RCF and URI, RCF is entitled to have two designees placed in nomination for a seat on the Board so long as any amounts remain outstanding under the loan agreement or RCF\u2019s partially-diluted ownership exceeds 25% of our common stock, and RCF has the right to participate in future equity offerings by URI in proportion to its percentage ownership (assuming conversion of amounts drawn under the RCF loan agreement) of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nBecause of RCF\u2019s ownership of URI common stock, RCF has the ability to exercise a substantial degree of control over matters requiring stockholder approval. Those matters include the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of URI or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult without the support of RCF, including transactions in which other stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. In addition, RCF could privately sell its stake in URI without other stockholders realizing any premium. RCF may also have other interests that are different from, in addition to or not always consistent with URI\u2019s interests or with the interests of other stockholders.\nWe have previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we cannot maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may need to restate our financial statements and we may be delayed or prevented from accessing the capital markets.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, particularly Section 404, and the applicable SEC rules and regulations that require an annual management report on our internal controls over financial reporting. The management report includes, among other matters, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for certain financial periods in 2012 and 2013 and we may not be capable of maintaining an effective system of internal control in the future. Our ability to identify and remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls could affect our ability to prepare financial reports in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations, and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory and financial risks, and integrate any acquired businesses. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting requirements in the future, including as a result of integrating the businesses of Anatolia Energy and URI could result in a restatement, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations, delay or prevent us from accessing the capital markets, and harm our reputation and the market price for our common stock.\nThe Navajo Nation\u2019s ban on uranium mining in what it considers to be Navajo Indian Country and its opposition to the transportation of radioactive substances over and across what it views as Navajo Nation lands may have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nIn April 2005, the Navajo Nation (\u201cNation\u201d) Council passed the Din\u00e9 Natural Resources Protection Act of 2005, 18 Navajo Nation Code \u00a71303, which prohibits uranium mining and processing on any sites within \u201cNavajo Indian Country\u201d as defined by 7 Navajo Nation Code \u00a7 254(A). The ban may impede or prevent us from developing and operating our properties located in federally defined Indian Country for two reasons. First, the Nation takes a more expansive view of its own jurisdiction over \u201cNavajo Indian Country\u201d than does current federal law. Specifically, 7 N.N.C. \u00a7 254(A) provides that the term \u201cNavajo Indian Country\u201d applies to all land within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation or of the Eastern Navajo Agency, Navajo Indian allotments, dependent Indian communities, and all land held in trust for, owned in fee by, or leased by the United States to the Nation. This may conflict with federal law as codified by Congress and interpreted by the federal courts. The term \u201cIndian Country\u201d is derived from jurisdictional determinations in criminal law enforcement proceedings under the federal Indian Country statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151, and understood to encompass territory situated within Indian reservations, land owned by Indian Allottees, and land within a dependent Indian community. Second, while the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has specifically held, en banc, that our Section 8 property in Churchrock, New Mexico is not Indian Country, approximately one-third of our in-place mineralized uranium material is located elsewhere in federally defined Indian Country. Consequently, with respect to the Nation, our ability to operate will be adversely affected unless Navajo law is modified or a waiver or other exemption is provided.\nIn February 2012, the Navajo Nation Council passed The Radioactive and Related Substances, Equipment, Vehicles, Persons and Materials Transportation Act of 2012 which would prohibit the transport across Nation lands of any equipment, vehicles, persons or materials for the purposes of exploring for or mining, producing, processing or milling any uranium ore, yellowcake, radioactive waste or other radioactive products on or under the surface of or adjacent to Nation lands unless the transporter has first (i) obtained Nation consent and a federal grant of easement, (ii) consented to full subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the Nation, and (iii) agreed to terms and conditions regarding clean-up and remediation. The Act would also require the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cNNEPA\u201d) to promulgate regulations implementing notice requirements, license fees, bonding requirements, route restrictions and curfews for the transportation of radioactive substances over and across Nation lands or otherwise within Navajo Indian Country. The Act, which may conflict with federal laws and regulations governing the transport of radioactive materials, could have a material adverse effect on our future operations, including our ability to transport equipment and personnel to and from our properties and to transport resin from New Mexico to our processing facilities in Texas or the Republic of Turkey.\nIn April 2012, the Nation\u2019s Division of Natural Resources issued a Notice of Violation and Order to Comply with the Navajo Nation Civil Trespass Act (the \u201cNOV\u201d) against our subsidiary Hydro Resources, Inc. (\u201cHRI\u201d). The NOV assessed a $50 civil assessment for alleged trespass on Section 9, Township 16 North, Range 16 West, N.M.P.M. (\u201cSection 9\u201d), which is land held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Nation (\u201cTrust Lands\u201d). The NOV stated that HRI\u2019s Section 8 Churchrock property cannot be reached from New Mexico State Highway 566 without crossing either Section 9 or Section 17, both of which are Trust Lands, and that the Highway 566 right-of-way does not abut or extend into the Section 8 Churchrock property. The NOV demanded that HRI cease entering upon and crossing Section 9 and Section 17 for the purpose of transporting vehicles, equipment and/or personnel to the Section 8 Churchrock property until HRI either (i) provided documentation of a validly existing right-of-way or easement; or (ii) obtained an appropriate right-of-way from the Nation.\nIn July 2012, HRI and the Nation resolved the NOV by entering into a Temporary Access Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement, HRI and its contractors may now access Section 8 through either Section 9 or 17 to support site visits by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and to satisfy other administrative permitting and licensing requirements related to the Churchrock Project. The Agreement does not extend to construction-related or earth-disturbing activities. HRI has further agreed to remediate any radioactive contamination now existing on Sections 8 and 17 surface lands created by prior operators prior to commencing mining operations on Section 8. Under the terms and for the duration of this Agreement, HRI has agreed to the jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement. HRI and the Nation have been engaged in additional settlement discussions since 2012 in order to determine effective compliance with the remediation requirement included in the Agreement and to address longer-term surface access to the entire licensed Project site consistent with applicable law. While we have entered into an agreement to sell HRI to a third party, if further agreement with the Nation is not reached and we continue to hold HRI, our development plan could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of our mineral properties may be subject to defects in title and we are at risk of loss of ownership.\nMany of our mining properties are unpatented mining claims to which we have only possessory title. The validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain and such validity is always subject to contest. Unpatented mining claims are generally considered subject to greater title risk than patented mining claims or other real property interests that are owned in fee simple. Because unpatented mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained, they possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims from public real property records, and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location, perfection and maintenance of an unpatented mining claim. The present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the exclusive right to remove locatable minerals, such as uranium. We are also allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. However, legal ownership of the public land remains with the federal government. We remain at risk that the mining claims may be lost either to the federal government or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements. In addition, we may not have, or may not be able to obtain, all necessary surface rights to develop a property.\nWe may incur significant costs related to defending the title to our properties. A successful claim contesting our title to a property may cause us to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property or lose our rights to explore and develop that property. This could result in us not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property.\nExploration and development of uranium properties are risky and subject to great uncertainties.\nThe exploration for and development of uranium deposits involve significant risks. It is impossible to ensure that the current and future exploration programs on our existing properties will establish reserves. Whether a uranium ore body will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; uranium prices, which cannot be predicted and which have been highly volatile in the past; mining, processing and transportation costs; perceived levels of political risk and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide project financing; availability of labor, labor costs and possible labor strikes; availability of drilling rigs; and governmental regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting materials, foreign exchange, environmental protection, employment, worker safety, transportation, and reclamation and closure obligations. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of uranium and there can be no assurance that any of our exploration stage properties will be commercially mineable or can be brought into production.\nWe may enter into acquisitions, dispositions or other material transactions at any time.\nWe are regularly engaged in a review of opportunities to acquire or dispose of properties, to partner with other companies on projects or to acquire or merge with companies. We currently, and generally at any time, have such opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and participation in discussions or negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions. Any such acquisition or disposition could be material to us. We could issue common stock or incur additional indebtedness to fund our acquisitions. Issuances of common stock may dilute existing stockholders. In addition, any such acquisition, disposition or other transaction may have other transaction specific risks associated with it, including risks related to the completion of the transaction, the project or the jurisdictions in which the project is located. We could enter into one or more acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions at any time.\nThe developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan continue to have a negative impact on the uranium markets and public acceptance of nuclear energy is uncertain.\nThe developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake and tsunami that struck parts of Japan in March 2011 created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear power plants and the ability to safeguard the material used to fuel nuclear power plants. The impact on the perception of the safety of nuclear power resulting from this event may cause increased volatility of uranium prices in the near to mid-term as well as uncertainty involving the continued use and expansion of nuclear power in certain countries. A reduction in the current or the future generation of electricity from nuclear power could result in a reduced requirement for uranium to fuel nuclear power plants which may negatively impact URI in the future.\nMaintaining the demand for uranium at current levels and future growth in demand will depend upon acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity. The developments at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant may affect public acceptance of nuclear technology. Lack of public acceptance of nuclear technology would adversely affect the demand for nuclear power and potentially increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry.\nThe only significant market for uranium is nuclear power plants world-wide, and there are a limited number of customers.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of electric utilities that buy uranium for nuclear power plants. Because of the limited market for uranium, a reduction in purchases of newly produced uranium by electric utilities for any reason (such as plant closings) would adversely affect the viability of our business.\nThe price of alternative energy sources affects the demand for and price of uranium.\nThe attractiveness of uranium as an alternative fuel to generate electricity may be dependent on the relative prices of oil, gas, coal and hydro-electricity and the possibility of developing other low-cost sources of energy. If the prices of alternative energy sources decrease or new low-cost alternative energy sources are developed, the demand for uranium could decrease, which may result in a decrease in the price of uranium.\nWe may not be able to mine a substantial portion of our uranium in New Mexico until a mill is built in New Mexico.\nA substantial portion of our uranium in New Mexico lends itself most readily to conventional mining methods and may not be able to be mined unless a mill is built in New Mexico. We have no immediate plans to build, nor are we aware of any third party\u2019s plan to build, a mill in New Mexico and there can be no guarantee that a mill will be built. In the event that a mill is not built, a substantial portion of our uranium may not be able to be mined. Our inability to mine all or a portion of our uranium in New Mexico would have a material adverse effect on future operations.\nOur operations are each subject to environmental risks.\nWe are required to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements in the United States and the Republic of Turkey, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. We have expended significant resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. The material laws and regulations within the U.S. include the Atomic Energy Act, Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, or UMTRCA, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Park System Mining Regulations Act, the State Mined Land Reclamation Acts or State Department of Environmental Quality regulations and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the NNEPA, as applicable.\nWe are required to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by UMTRCA, by applying for and maintaining an operating license from the NRC and the state of Texas. Uranium operations must conform to the terms of such licenses, which include provisions for protection of human health and the environment from endangerment due to radioactive materials. The licenses encompass protective measures consistent with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Mining operations may be subject to other laws administered by the USEPA and other agencies.\nThe uranium industry is subject not only to the worker health and safety and environmental risks associated with all mining businesses, but also to additional risks uniquely associated with uranium ISR, mining and milling. The possibility of more stringent regulations exists in the areas of worker health and safety, storage of hazardous materials, standards for heavy equipment used in ISR, mining or milling, the disposition of wastes, the decommissioning and reclamation of exploration, mining and ISR sites, climate change and other environmental matters, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the cost or the viability of a particular project.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation, regulation or policy will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation, generally, is toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. This recent trend includes, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, reclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of certain species and the preservation of certain lands. These regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities. These laws and regulations may also limit or prohibit activities on certain lands. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may necessitate significant capital outlays, may materially affect our results of operations and business or may cause material changes or delays our intended activities.\nOur operations may require additional analysis in the future including environmental, cultural and social impact and other related studies. Certain activities require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits that may be required to continue our operation or exploration of our properties or, if feasible, to commence development, construction or operation of mining facilities at such properties on terms which enable operations to be conducted at economically justifiable costs. If we are unable to obtain or maintain permits or water rights for development of our properties or otherwise fail to manage adequately future environmental issues, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nClosure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for uranium operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and closure plans that may change materially. Any underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income in the related period.\nThe laws and regulations governing closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.\nBecause mineral exploration and development activities are inherently risky, we may be exposed to environmental liabilities and other dangers. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance, or liabilities exceed the limits of our insurance policies, we may be unable to continue operations.\nThe business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production. Unusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are other risks involved in extraction operations and the conduct of exploration programs. Previous mining operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of our properties. It may be difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by us or by the activities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be ineffective. If any of our properties are found to have commercial quantities of uranium, we would be subject to additional risks respecting any development and production activities.\nAlthough we carry liability insurance with respect to our mineral exploration operations, we may become subject to liability for damage to life and property, environmental damage, cave-ins or hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of cost or other business reasons. In addition, the insurance industry is undergoing change and premiums are being increased. If we are unable to procure adequate insurance because of cost, unavailability or otherwise, we might be forced to cease operations.\nReserve and other mineralized material calculations are estimates only, and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the price of uranium, inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of uranium in the recovery process.\nThe calculation of reserves, other mineralized material tons and grades are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and geostatistical relationships or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and mineralized material and their corresponding grades. Until reserves and other mineralized materials are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of reserves and other mineralized materials may vary depending on the price of uranium. Any material change in the quantity of reserves, other mineralized materials, mineralization or grade may affect the economic viability of our properties.\nOur inability to obtain financial surety would threaten our ability to continue in business.\nFuture financial surety requirements to comply with federal and state environmental and remediation requirements and to secure necessary licenses and approvals will increase significantly as future development and production occurs at certain of our sites in the United States and Turkey. The amount of the financial surety for each producing property is subject to annual review and revision by regulators. We expect that the issuer of the financial surety instruments will require us to provide cash collateral for a significant amount of the face amount of the bond to secure the obligation. In the event we are not able to raise, secure or generate sufficient funds necessary to satisfy these requirements, we will be unable to develop our sites and bring them into production, which inability will have a material adverse impact on our business and may negatively affect our ability to continue to operate.\nCompetition from better-capitalized companies affects prices and our ability to acquire both properties and personnel.\nThere is global competition for uranium properties, capital, customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. In the production and marketing of uranium, there are a number of producing entities, some of which are government controlled and all of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Many of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than we have.\nOur future uranium production will also compete with uranium recovered from the de-enrichment of highly enriched uranium obtained from the dismantlement of United States and Russian nuclear weapons and imports to the United States of\nuranium from the former Soviet Union and from the sale of uranium inventory held by the United States Department of Energy. In addition, there are numerous entities in the market that compete with us for properties and are attempting to become licensed to operate ISR and/or underground mining facilities. If we are unable to successfully compete for properties, capital, customers or employees or with alternative uranium sources, it could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we have limited capital, inherent mining risks pose a significant threat to us compared with our larger competitors.\nBecause we have limited capital we may be unable to withstand significant losses that can result from inherent risks associated with mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, flooding, earthquake, interruptions due to weather conditions and other acts of nature which larger competitors could withstand. Such risks could result in damage to or destruction of our infrastructure and production facilities, as well as to adjacent properties, personal injury, environmental damage and processing and production delays, causing monetary losses and possible legal liability. Our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business and mineral exploration programs depend upon our ability to employ the services of geologists, engineers and other experts. In operating our business and in order to continue our programs, we compete for the services of professionals with other mineral exploration companies and businesses. In addition, several entities have expressed an interest in hiring certain of our employees. Our ability to maintain and expand our business and continue our exploration programs may be impaired if we are unable to continue to employ or engage those parties currently providing services and expertise to us or identify and engage other qualified personnel to do so in their place. To retain key employees, we may face increased compensation costs, including potential new stock incentive grants and there can be no assurance that the incentive measures we implement will be successful in helping us retain our key personnel.\nThe availability for sale of a large amount of shares may depress the market price of URI\u2019s common stock.\nAs of March 18, 2016, approximately 5.2 million shares of our common stock were outstanding, all of which, except for the certain shares owned by RCF and Aspire Capital, are freely transferable. As of March 18 2016, there were 12,313 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options issued under our equity incentive plans, 577,663 shares issuable upon the exercise of options issued to former Anatolia Energy option holders in connection with the Anatolia Transaction, 5,832 shares issuable upon the exercise of options issued to Insight Transportation Services LLC in connection with the closing of the Anatolia Transaction, 32,706 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, 183,333 shares underlying warrants issued in connection with our March 2015 registered direct offering, and 256,410 shares issuable upon the conversion of amounts outstanding under the RCF loan agreement. The availability for sale of a large amount of shares by any one or several stockholders may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the public sale of our common stock. We have has no arrangement with any of the holders of the foregoing shares to address the possible effect on the price of our common stock of the sale by them of their shares.\nThe availability for sale of a large amount of shares by any one or several stockholders may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the public sale of our common stock. We have has no arrangement with any of the holders of the foregoing shares to address the possible effect on the price of our common stock of the sale by them of their shares.\nTerms of subsequent financings may adversely impact our stockholders.\nIn order to finance our future production plans and working capital needs, we may have to raise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Depending on the type and the terms of any financing we pursue, stockholders\u2019 rights and the value of their investment in our common stock could be reduced. A financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. We currently have no authorized preferred stock. In addition, if we issue secured debt securities, the holders of the debt would have a claim to our assets that would be prior to the rights of stockholders until the debt is paid. Interest on these debt securities would increase costs and negatively impact operating results. If the issuance of new securities results in diminished rights to holders of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nShareholders could be diluted if we were to use common stock to raise capital.\nWe may need to seek additional capital to carry our business plan. This financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be dilutive to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75672, "SIC": 1090, "TIC": "WWR"}
