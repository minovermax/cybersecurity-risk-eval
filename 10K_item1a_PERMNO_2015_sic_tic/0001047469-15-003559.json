{"cik": "77449", "company": "PEP BOYS MANNY MOE & JACK", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThe following section discloses all known material risks that we face. However, it does not include risks that may arise in the future that are yet unknown nor existing risks that we do not judge material to the presentation of our financial statements. If any of the events or circumstances described as risk below actually occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Pep Boys\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur long-term strategic plan, which we update annually, includes numerous initiatives including our \"Road Ahead\" remodels and store growth programs to increase sales, enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nSuccessful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry, many of which may be beyond our control (see \"Risks Related to Our Industry\").\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, our liquidity will suffer and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations.\nWe require significant capital to fund our business. While we believe we have the ability to sufficiently fund our planned operations and capital expenditures for the next fiscal year, circumstances could arise that would materially affect our liquidity. For example, cash flows from our operations could be affected by changes in consumer spending habits or the failure to maintain favorable supplier payment terms or our inability to successfully implement sales growth initiatives. We may be unsuccessful in securing alternative financing when needed, on terms that we consider acceptable, or at all.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences on investments in our securities, including the following risks:\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022 a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of rent and the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022 our failure to comply with financial and operating restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries by our credit facilities could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or our prospects; and\n\u2022 if we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, we might be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do.\nWe have recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges and may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nAt January 31, 2015, we had $32.9 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. Certain factors, including consumer and business spending levels, industry and macroeconomic conditions, competition, the price of our stock and the future profitability of our business might have a negative impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. Our reporting units have experienced challenging economic, industry and operating pressures, and if these pressures were to continue for a sustained period of time, this would increase the risk associated with their significant goodwill balances. The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions and estimates, and our goodwill may become impaired in future periods. The amount of this impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe depend on our relationships with our suppliers and a disruption of these relationships or of our suppliers' operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with our suppliers. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example, financial difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or might interrupt our source of supply. In addition, our failure to promptly pay or order sufficient\nquantities of inventory from our suppliers may increase the cost of products we purchase or could lead to suppliers refusing to sell products to us at all.\nA disruption of our supplier relationships or a disruption in our suppliers' operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management team and our other personnel, and we face substantial competition for qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management team. Our continued success will also depend on our ability to retain existing, and attract additional, qualified field personnel to meet our needs. We face substantial competition, both from within and outside of the automotive aftermarket, to retain and attract qualified personnel. In addition, we believe that the number of qualified automotive service technicians in the industry is generally insufficient to meet demand.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and may be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, the ownership and operation of real property and the sale of small engine merchandise. When we acquire or dispose of real property or enter into financings secured by real property, we undertake investigations that may reveal soil and/or groundwater contamination at the subject real property. All such known contamination has either been remediated, or is in the process of being remediated. Any costs expected to be incurred related to such contamination are either covered by insurance or financial reserves provided for in the consolidated financial statements. However, there exists the possibility of additional soil and/or groundwater contamination on our real property where we have not undertaken an investigation. A failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA breach of our security could compromise customer, employee or Company information and could harm our reputation, lead to substantial additional costs, or possible litigation.\nIn the course of business, personal information about our customers and employees is stored both electronically and physically. We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to safeguard this information. If this information is compromised, however, our reputation could be damaged resulting in lost business, we could incur additional costs in remediating the issue, or we could face possible regulatory action. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures we have implemented are adequate to safeguard all confidential information, and a breach of this information could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness interruptions may negatively impact our store hours, operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nWar or acts of terrorism, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or other natural disasters, or the threat of any of these calamities or others, may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores, result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time, negatively affect the lives of our customers or associates, or otherwise negatively impact our operations. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become\ndifficult or impossible to import into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected.\nIn the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores.\nTerrorist attacks, war, or insurrection involving any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel and other types of energy. Such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers, and also would negatively impact our customers' disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business, sales, profit margins and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory, process transactions and report results. Any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory. Any such loss, if widespread or extended, could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive, and price competition in some segments of the automotive aftermarket, or a loss of trust in our participation in the \"do-it-for-me\" market, could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings.\nThe automotive aftermarket retail and service industry is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with the following types of businesses in each segment of the automotive aftermarket:\nRetail\nDo-It-Yourself\n\u2022 automotive parts and accessories stores;\n\u2022 automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories;\n\u2022 mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and select non-automotive merchandise that appeals to automotive \"Do-It-Yourself\" customers, such as generators, power tools and canopies; and\n\u2022 online retailers\nCommercial\n\u2022 mass and on-line merchandisers, wholesalers and jobbers (some of which are associated with national parts distributors or associations).\nService\nDo-It-For-Me\n\u2022 regional and local full service automotive repair shops;\n\u2022 automobile dealers that provide repair and maintenance services;\n\u2022 national and regional (including franchised) tire retailers that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services; and\n\u2022 national and regional (including franchised) specialized automotive (such as oil change, brake and transmission) repair facilities that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services.\nTires\n\u2022 national and regional (including franchised) tire retailers; and\n\u2022 mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell tires.\nA number of our competitors have more financial resources, are more geographically diverse, have a higher geographic market concentration or have better name recognition than we do, which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors. Because we seek to offer competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices we may reduce our prices, which could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings.\nWith respect to the service labor category, the majority of consumers are unfamiliar with their vehicle's mechanical operation and, as a result, often select a service provider based on trust. Potential occurrences of negative publicity associated with the Pep Boys brand, the products we sell or installation or repairs performed in our service bays, whether or not factually accurate, could cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services in the short or long term, and cause them to choose our competitors for their automotive service needs.\nVehicle miles driven may decrease, resulting in a decline of our revenues and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur industry is significantly influenced by the number of vehicle miles driven. Factors that may cause the number of vehicle miles and our revenues and our results of operations to decrease include:\n\u2022 the weather-as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather;\n\u2022 the economy-as during periods of poor economic conditions, customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair and drive less due to unemployment, and during periods of good economic conditions, consumers may opt to purchase new vehicles rather than service the vehicles they currently own and replace worn or damaged parts;\n\u2022 gas prices-as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles; and\n\u2022 travel patterns-as changes in travel patterns may cause consumers to rely more heavily on mass transportation.\nEconomic factors affecting consumer spending habits may continue, resulting in a decline in revenues and could negatively impact our business.\nMany economic and other factors outside our control, including consumer confidence, consumer spending levels, employment levels, consumer debt levels and inflation, as well as the availability of consumer credit, affect consumer spending habits. A significant deterioration in the global financial markets and economic environment, recessions or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits and result in lower levels of economic activity. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. Any of these events and factors could cause consumers to curtail spending, especially with respect to our more discretionary merchandise offerings, such as automotive accessories, tools and personal transportation products.\nConsolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business.\nOur industry has experienced consolidation over time. If this trend continues or if our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, the Company may face greater competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate.", "PERMNO": 35238, "SIC": 5531, "TIC": "PBY.1"}
