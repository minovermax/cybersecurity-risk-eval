{"cik": "1675149", "company": "Alcoa Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAlcoa\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing Alcoa\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those\nprojected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Alcoa or that Alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe aluminum industry and aluminum end-use markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.\nThe aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical, and we are subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum end-use markets. The demand for aluminum is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in industries that are cyclical, such as the commercial construction and transportation, automotive, and aerospace industries, which may change as a result of changes in the global economy, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond our control. The demand for aluminum is highly correlated to economic growth. For example, the European sovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009 had an adverse effect on European demand for aluminum and aluminum products. The Chinese market is a significant source of global demand for, and supply of, commodities, including aluminum. A sustained slowdown in China\u2019s economic growth and aluminum demand, or a significant slowdown in other markets, that is not offset by decreases in supply of aluminum or increased aluminum demand in emerging economies, such as India, Brazil, and several South East Asian countries, could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices.\nWhile we believe the long-term prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive, we are unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength of the global economy and the effects of government intervention. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, a downturn in the commodity sector, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile the aluminum market is often the leading cause of changes in the alumina and bauxite markets, those markets also have industry-specific risks including, but not limited to, global freight markets, energy markets, and regional supply-demand imbalances. The aluminum industry specific risks can have a material effect on profitability for the alumina and bauxite markets.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices, including global, regional and product-specific prices.\nThe overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components: (i) the underlying base metal component, which is typically based on quoted prices from the LME; (ii) the regional premium, which comprises the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States); and (iii) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., coil, billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy. Each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability. The LME price is typically driven by macroeconomic factors, global supply and demand of aluminum (including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories), and trading activity of financial investors. An imbalance in global supply and demand of aluminum, such as decreasing demand without corresponding supply declines, could have a negative impact on aluminum pricing. Speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years, contributing to higher levels of price volatility. In 2016, the cash LME price of aluminum reached a high of $1,777 per metric ton and a low of $1,453 per metric ton. High LME inventories, or the release of substantial inventories into the market, could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum. Declines in the LME price have had a negative impact on our results of operations. Additionally, our results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum. Regional premiums tend to vary based on the supply of and\ndemand for metal in a particular region and associated transportation costs. LME warehousing rules and surpluses have caused regional premiums to decrease, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product premiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular region. Periods of industry overcapacity may also result in a weak aluminum pricing environment. A sustained weak LME aluminum pricing environment, deterioration in LME aluminum prices, or a decrease in regional premiums or product premiums could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.\nMost of our alumina contracts contain two pricing components: (1) the API price basis and (2) a negotiated adjustment basis that takes into account various factors, including freight, quality, customer location and market conditions. Because the API component can exhibit significant volatility due to market exposure, revenue associated with our alumina operations are exposed to market pricing. Our bauxite-related contracts are typically one to two-year contracts with very little, if any, market exposure; however, we intend to enter into long-term bauxite contracts and therefore, our revenue associated with our bauxite operations may become further exposed to market pricing.\nChanges to LME warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease.\nSince 2013, the LME has been engaged in a program aimed at reforming the rules under which registered warehouses in its global network operate. The initial rule changes took effect on February 1, 2015. Additional changes occurred throughout 2015 and 2016, culminating in an increased minimum daily load-out rate and caps on warehouse charges. These rule changes, and any subsequent changes the exchange chooses to make, could impact the supply/demand balance in the primary aluminum physical market and may impact regional delivery premiums and LME aluminum prices. Decreases in regional delivery premiums and/or decreases in LME aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits from our strategy of creating a lower cost, competitive commodity business by optimizing our portfolio.\nWe are continuing to execute a strategy of creating a lower cost, competitive integrated aluminum production business by optimizing our portfolio. We are creating a competitive standalone business by taking decisive actions to lower the cost base of our upstream operations, including closing, selling or curtailing high-cost global smelting capacity, optimizing alumina refining capacity, and pursuing the sale of our interest in certain other operations.\nWe have made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline our portfolio. There is no assurance that anticipated benefits of our strategic actions will be realized. With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, we may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders. In addition, we may incur unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Our business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee Separation Transaction costs, asset impairment charges and other measures. There can be no assurance that divestitures or closures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned at the anticipated cost, or that such actions will be beneficial to the Company.\nMarket-driven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by non-market forces or other impediments to production closures.\nIn response to market-driven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum and alumina, we have curtailed or closed portions of our aluminum and alumina production capacity. Certain other industry producers have independently undertaken to reduce production as well. Reductions in production may be delayed or impaired by the terms of long-term contracts to buy power or raw materials.\nThe existence of non-market forces on global aluminum industry capacity, such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry self-sufficiency, may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers\u2019 smelters, irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve. For example, Chinese excess capacity and increased exports from China of heavily subsidized aluminum products could materially disrupt world aluminum markets causing pricing deterioration. If industry overcapacity exists due to the disruption by such non-market forces on the market-driven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum, a resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of the Company.\nOur operations consume substantial amounts of energy; profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted.\nOur operations consume substantial amounts of energy. Although we generally expect to meet the energy requirements for our alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, certain conditions could negatively affect our results of operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in fuel oil or natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nunavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts, hurricanes or other natural causes;\n\u2022\nunavailability of energy due to local or regional energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in energy supply or unplanned outages due to equipment failure or other causes;\n\u2022\ncurtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to the inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or to negotiate new arrangements on cost-effective terms or due to the unavailability of energy at competitive rates; or\n\u2022\ncurtailment of one or more smelters due to discontinuation of power supply interruptibility rights granted to us under an interruptibility regime in place under the laws of the country in which the smelter is located, or due to a determination that such arrangements do not comply with applicable laws, thus rendering the smelter operations that had been relying on such country\u2019s interruptibility regime uneconomic.\nIf events such as those listed above were to occur, the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit we received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur global operations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe have operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Guinea, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\neconomic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical risks, such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, changes to import or export regulations and fees, renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;\n\u2022\nwar or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nmajor public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, the Ebola virus or the Zika virus), which could cause disruptions in our operations or workforce;\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nunexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.\nWhile the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events.\nOur global operations expose us to various legal and regulatory systems, and changes in conditions beyond our control in foreign countries.\nIn addition to the business risks inherent in operating outside the United States, legal and regulatory systems may be less developed and predictable and the possibility of various types of adverse governmental action more pronounced. Unexpected or uncontrollable events or circumstances in any of these foreign markets, including actions by foreign governments such as changes in fiscal regimes, termination of our agreements with such foreign governments or increased government regulation could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSubstantial changes to fiscal, tax and trade policies and legislation could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nExecutive and legislative actions, including changes in fiscal, tax and trade policies, may adversely affect our business. At this time it is unclear what the new U.S. administration and Congress may do with respect to these policies, regulations, and legislation. The new U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in U.S. import tariffs. Changes in international trade agreements, regulations, restrictions, and tariffs may increase our operating costs and make it more difficult for us to compete in the U.S. and overseas markets, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe face significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.\nWe compete with a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. aluminum industry competitors. Our metals also compete with other materials, such as steel, titanium, plastics, composites, ceramics, and glass, among others. Technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Alcoa\u2019s competitors or customers could affect our results of operations. In addition, our competitive position depends, in part, on its ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets and having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. See \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d\nOur business is capital intensive, and if there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend operations with respect to those industries, which could result in our recording asset impairment charges or taking other measures that may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business operations are capital intensive, and we devote a significant amount of capital to certain industries. If there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations with respect to those industries, including laying-off employees, recording asset impairment charges and other measures. In addition, we may not realize the benefits or expected returns from announced plans, programs, initiatives and capital investments. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in our capital expenditures.\nWe require substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of our existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact our ability to fund as planned our sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. We may also need to address commercial and political\nissues in relation to reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our interest in our joint ventures is diluted or we lose key concessions, our growth could be constrained. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements, and we are exposed to risks associated with financial, credit, capital and banking markets.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we expect to seek to access competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets. Currently, we believe we have adequate access to these markets to meet our reasonably anticipated business needs based on our historic financial performance, as well as our expected continued strong financial position. To the extent our access to competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets was to be impaired, our operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nDeterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit.\nThe major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations and execution. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive impact our borrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms that will be advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets. In addition, our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating, our borrowing costs would increase, and our funding sources could decrease. As a result of these factors, a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.\nOur indebtedness restricts our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.\nOn September 16, 2016, Alcoa and Alcoa Nederland Holding B.V. (\u201cANHBV\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein, as amended, (the \u201cRevolving Credit Agreement\u201d). The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our notes include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain disqualified equity interests and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, including a limit on dividends on equity securities or payments to redeem, repurchase or retire equity securities or other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmaterially alter the business we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into certain restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Alcoa\u2019s, ANHBV\u2019s or a subsidiary guarantor\u2019s assets; and\n\u2022\ntake any actions that would reduce our ownership of AWAC entities below an agreed level.\nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires that we maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 2.25 to 1.00 and an interest expense coverage ratio no less than 5.00 to 1.00, in each case, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of Alcoa.\nFor more information on the restrictive covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement, see Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities.\u201d\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Agreement or the indenture governing our notes.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our notes, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument also could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.\nWe may not realize expected benefits from our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.\nWe have undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including procurement strategies for raw materials, labor productivity, improving operating performance, deployment of Company-wide business process models, such as our degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and overhead cost reductions. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to us or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.\nCyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of our intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt our business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.\nWe believe that we face a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries we serve and the locations of our operations. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of our information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on our financial condition\nor results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of our investment in research and development.\nOur profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or LME-linked costs or by large or sudden shifts in the global inventory of aluminum and the resulting market price impacts.\nOur results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials, including energy, carbon products, caustic soda and other key inputs, as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Similarly, our operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or LME-linked. For example, declines in the costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period. We could also be adversely affected by large or sudden shifts in the global inventory of aluminum and the resulting market price impacts. Increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum, or shifts in global inventory of aluminum that result in changes to market prices, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nJoint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful.\nWe participate in joint ventures and have formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For example, AWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited. AWAC consists of a number of affiliated entities, which own, operate or have an interest in, bauxite mines and alumina refineries, as well as an aluminum smelter, in seven countries. In addition, Alcoa Corporation is party to a joint venture with Ma\u2019aden, the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex (including a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter and rolling mill) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Although the Company has, in connection with these and our other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances, sought to protect our interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not the Company holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, our partners may:\n\u2022\nhave economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company;\n\u2022\nexercise veto rights so as to block actions that we believe to be in our or the joint venture\u2019s or strategic alliance\u2019s best interests;\n\u2022\ntake action contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to our investments; or\n\u2022\nas a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.\nThere can be no assurance that our joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to us, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or joint venture partner.\nA significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or joint venture partner could affect our results of operations in a particular period. Our customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses. If we are not successful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected. Our joint venture partners could be rendered unable to contribute their share of operating or capital costs, having an adverse impact on our business.\nCustomer concentration and supplier capacity in the Rolled Products segment could adversely impact margins.\nOur Rolled Products segment primarily serves the North American aluminum food and beverage can and bottle markets. Four aluminum can and bottle manufacturers comprise over 90% of the aluminum beverage can and bottle market; Rolled Products competes with both domestic and foreign sheet rolling mills to supply these manufacturers. In this segment, customers tend to sign multiple year supply contracts for the vast majority of their requirements. Our customer mix reflects industry concentrations and norms; loss of existing customers or renegotiated pricing on new contracts could adversely affect both operating levels and profitability.\nAn adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense we record for our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. We calculate income or expense for our plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nThese valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by the Company to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to stockholders\u2019 equity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d and Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefits.\u201d Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities we would contribute to the pension plans.\nPotential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (\u201cMAP-21\u201d), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like the Company who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (\u201cHATFA\u201d) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\u201cBBA 2015\u201d) was enacted, which extends the relief period provided by HAFTA. We believe that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company\u2019s U.S. pension plans\u2019 funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans\u2019 funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on our cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase our liabilities related to such plans, adversely affecting our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, and other economic factors in the countries in which we operate.\nEconomic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which we operate, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, particularly the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Euro and Norwegian kroner, may affect our profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while our products are generally sold in U.S. dollars. In addition, although a strong U.S. dollar generally has a positive impact on our near-term profitability, over a longer term, a strong U.S. dollar may have an unfavorable impact on our position on the global aluminum cost curve due to the company\u2019s U.S. smelting portfolio. As the U.S. dollar strengthens, the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the United States but costs for our U.S. smelting portfolio may not decline.\nWeakness in global economic conditions or in any of the industries or geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 businesses generally or sustained uncertainty in financial markets, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability by reducing demand and margins.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and in global capital markets. There has been extreme volatility in the capital markets and in the end markets and geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, which has negatively affected our revenues. Many of the markets in which our customers participate are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions, consumer demand, raw material and energy costs, and government actions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nA decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business. We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers\u2019 business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. These conditions and a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events could adversely affect our profitability, cash flow and financial condition.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the company\u2019s tax expense and profitability. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes\ncontinue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. Significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.\nOur results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to the Company. We may become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. We are also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, anti-bribery laws, competition laws and sales and trading practices. We could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. In addition, if we violate the terms of our agreements with governmental authorities, we may face additional monetary sanctions and such other remedies as a court deems appropriate.\nWhile we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. See \u201cItem 3, Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note R under the caption \u201cContingencies and Commitments-Contingencies-Litigation\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.\nOur operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites, at sites previously operated by the Company, at sites owned by our predecessors or at sites that we may acquire in the future. Compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. Our results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows.\nClimate change, climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nEnergy is a significant input in a number of our operations. There is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies in areas of the world where we operate have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. We will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which we operate. These regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the Company\u2019s assets. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the Company and, indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nWe may be subject to claims under federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liabilities Act (CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund). Such claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate currently, as well as at sites that we and companies we acquired owned or operated in the past, and at contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties. Liability may be without regard to fault and may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.\nThese and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us.\nLoss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management team. The loss of the services of any member of our executive management team or other key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnion disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. See \u201cBusiness-Employees.\u201d We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nRisks Related to the Separation Transaction\nWe have only operated as an independent company since November 1, 2016, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the time periods represented and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical information about Alcoa Corporation in this report refers to Alcoa Corporation\u2019s businesses as operated by and integrated with ParentCo prior to November 1, 2016. Our historical financial information included in this report is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of ParentCo. Accordingly, the historical financial information and fourth quarter and fiscal year financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nGenerally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of ParentCo. Following the completion of the Separation Transaction, our results of operations and cash flows are likely to be more volatile and we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation Transaction, our business was operated by ParentCo as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. ParentCo or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, human resources, investor relations, and finance. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from ParentCo for such functions, which are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nHistorically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with the other businesses of ParentCo. While we have sought to separate these arrangements with minimal impact on Alcoa, there is no guarantee these arrangements will continue to capture these benefits in the future.\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation Transaction, as a part of ParentCo, we took advantage of ParentCo\u2019s overall size and scope to procure more advantageous distribution arrangements, including shipping costs and arrangements. As now a standalone company, we may be unable to obtain similar arrangements to the same extent as ParentCo did, or on terms as favorable as those ParentCo obtained, prior to completion of the Separation Transaction.\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for our business may be higher than ParentCo\u2019s cost of capital prior to the Separation Transaction.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from ParentCo. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated financial statements, see \u201cSelected Financial Data of Alcoa Corporation,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction, and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation Transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation Transaction was expected to provide various benefits, including enabling each company to more effectively pursue its own distinct operating priorities and\nstrategies, to focus on its core business, and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for long-term growth and profitability, including capital structures and capital allocation strategies. We may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including that we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations, including fluctuations in commodities prices than if we were still a part of ParentCo because our business is less diversified than ParentCo\u2019s business prior to the Separation Transaction, we may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those ParentCo obtained prior to the Separation Transaction, and the Separation Transaction required and may continue to require Alcoa to pay costs that could be substantial and material to our financial resources. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation Transaction, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe costs incurred with respect to the Separation Transaction may not yield the expected benefits, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nThe process of completing the Separation Transaction was time-consuming and involved significant costs and expenses. For example, for the first ten months of 2016, ParentCo recorded nonrecurring Separation Transaction costs of $152 million, of which $68 million was allocated to the Company, which costs were primarily related to third-party consulting, contractor fees and other incremental costs directly associated with the Separation Transaction process. The Separation Transaction costs may not yield a discernible benefit if the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction are not realized. Executing the Separation Transaction also required significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort, which diverted management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business. Other challenges associated with effectively executing and implementing the Separation Transaction include attracting, retaining and motivating employees; addressing disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing and other operations resulting from separating ParentCo into two large but independent companies; separating ParentCo\u2019s information systems; and establishing a new brand identity in the marketplace. We have incurred, as a result of the Separation Transaction, both one-time and ongoing costs and expenses. These increased costs and expenses arose and may continue to arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), tax administration, and legal and human resources related functions), and it is possible that these costs will be material to our business.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our future access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain investment grade credit ratings.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are and will be subject as a standalone publicly traded company.\nOur financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of ParentCo, and we believe that our reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company. However, we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). As a standalone, publicly traded company, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, and will be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, require the hiring of additional finance, accounting and other personnel, entail\nsubstantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, adequate internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nArconic may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation Transaction or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic entered into the separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a stockholder and registration rights agreement with respect to Arconic\u2019s continuing ownership of Alcoa common stock, intellectual property license agreements, a metal supply agreement, real estate and office leases, a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the North American packaging business. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation Transaction for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides that Alcoa will pay over to Arconic the proceeds in respect of the sale of Alcoa\u2019s Yadkin hydroelectric project. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the Separation Transaction. Alcoa will rely on Arconic to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Arconic is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that ParentCo provided to us. However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services, we may incur additional costs in connection with, or following, the implementation of these systems and services, and we may not be successful in transitioning data from ParentCo\u2019s systems to ours.\nIn connection with our Separation Transaction from ParentCo, Arconic has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to Arconic, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Arconic indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Arconic will be allocated responsibility, and Arconic may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with ParentCo, Arconic has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d Indemnities that we may be required to provide Arconic are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Arconic has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnity from Arconic may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Arconic may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be held liable to Arconic if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement, and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations.\nAlcoa Corporation and Arconic entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the Separation Transaction pursuant to which Alcoa and Arconic provide each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, employee benefits administration, specialized technical and training services and access to certain industrial equipment, information technology services, regulatory services, continued industrial site remediation and closure services on discrete projects, project management services for certain equipment installation and decommissioning projects, general administrative services and other support services. If we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement, we may be held liable for any resulting losses suffered by Arconic, subject to certain limits. In addition, during the transition services periods, our management and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to Arconic, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable capital-raising or strategic transactions following the Separation Transaction.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Separation Transaction and the Distribution, and in addition to Alcoa\u2019s indemnity obligation described above, the tax matters agreement restricts Alcoa Corporation, for the two-year period following the Distribution, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of Alcoa stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of Alcoa stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of its businesses or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the Distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. For more information, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nThe terms we will receive in our agreements with Arconic could be less beneficial than the terms we may have otherwise received from unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements we entered into with Arconic in connection with the Separation Transaction, including a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a stockholder and registration rights agreement with respect to Arconic\u2019s continuing ownership of Alcoa common stock, intellectual property license agreements, a metal supply agreement, real estate and office leases, a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the North American packaging business were prepared in the context of the Separation Transaction while Alcoa Corporation was still a wholly owned subsidiary of ParentCo. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, we did not have an independent Board of Directors or a management team that was independent of ParentCo. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nIf the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arconic, Alcoa Corporation, and Arconic stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, Alcoa Corporation could be required to indemnify Arconic for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation Transaction and the Distribution received\nby ParentCo remain valid and be satisfactory to the ParentCo Board of Directors and (ii) ParentCo receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the ParentCo Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and rely on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of ParentCo and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Arconic or Alcoa breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel will represent the judgment of such counsel and will not be binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by ParentCo of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Arconic, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic stockholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIf the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Arconic stockholders who receive Alcoa shares in the Distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa, we may be required to indemnify Arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa or (iii) any of Alcoa\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For a more detailed discussion, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d In addition, Arconic, Alcoa, and their respective subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation Transaction, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from Separation Transactions in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material.\nCertain contingent liabilities allocated to Alcoa Corporation following the Separation Transaction may mature, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of ParentCo may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the ParentCo consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Distribution is severally liable for the entire U.S. federal income tax liability of the ParentCo consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group for that taxable period. Consequently, if Arconic is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation Transaction period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. For a\ndiscussion of the tax matters agreement, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nThe transfer to us of certain contracts, permits and other assets and rights may still require the consents or approvals of, or provide other rights to, third parties and governmental authorities. If such consents or approvals are not obtained, we may not be entitled to the benefit of such contracts, permits and other assets and rights, which could increase our expenses or otherwise harm our business and financial performance.\nThe separation and distribution agreement provided that certain contracts, permits and other assets and rights are to be transferred from Arconic or its subsidiaries to Alcoa or its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation Transaction. The transfer of certain of these contracts, permits and other assets and rights may still require consents or approvals of third parties or governmental authorities or provide other rights to third parties. In addition, in some circumstances, we and Arconic are joint beneficiaries of contracts, and we and Arconic may need the consents of third parties in order to split or bifurcate the existing contracts or the relevant portion of the existing contracts to us or Arconic. Some parties may use consent requirements or other rights to seek to terminate contracts or obtain more favorable contractual terms from us. The termination or modification of these contracts or permits or the failure to timely complete the transfer or bifurcation of these contracts or permits could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nArconic owns 12,958,767 shares of our common stock. We have registered on a registration statement on Form S-1 such shares under the terms of a stockholder and registration rights agreement between us and Arconic. The sale of such shares in one or more offerings may cause our stock price to decline.\nAny sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, in connection with an offering by Arconic or otherwise, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Upon completion of an offering by Arconic of its shares, we will continue to have an aggregate of approximately 184 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Shares will generally be freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), except for shares owned by one of our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.\nFollowing the Distribution, Arconic retained approximately 19.9% of outstanding shares of our common stock, and as of March 1, 2017, it owns approximately 7.0% of outstanding shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the IRS private letter ruling, Arconic is required to dispose of such shares of our common stock that it owns as soon as practicable and consistent with its reasons for retaining such shares, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.\u201d We have registered on a registration statement on Form S-1 such shares under the terms of a stockholder and registration rights agreement between us and Arconic. Any disposition by Arconic, or any significant stockholder, of our common stock in the public market in one or more offerings, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could enable our management to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our stockholders, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nAlcoa\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Alcoa\u2019s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent unless such written consent is unanimous;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to call a special stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make Alcoa immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Alcoa and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and Delaware law, that have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Alcoa stock.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, Alcoa is required to indemnify Arconic for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against Alcoa and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, a state court located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Alcoa, any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer of Alcoa to Alcoa or to Alcoa stockholders, any action asserting a claim against Alcoa or any current or former director or officer of Alcoa arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any action asserting a claim relating to or involving Alcoa governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if a Delaware state court dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the action may be brought in the federal court for the District of Delaware. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with Alcoa or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against Alcoa and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nYour percentage of ownership in Alcoa may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Alcoa may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will grant to our directors, officers and\nemployees. Our employees have stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock as a result of conversion of their ParentCo stock-based awards. Our compensation committee has granted stock-based awards to our employees, and we anticipate that the committee will grant additional stock-based awards to our employees in the future. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee the existence, timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe existence, timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our stockholders falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors\u2019 decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we commence paying dividends.", "PERMNO": 16347, "SIC": 3330, "TIC": "AA"}
