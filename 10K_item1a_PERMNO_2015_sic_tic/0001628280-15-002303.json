Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, in particular, certain statements about our plans, strategies and prospects. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements include those set forth in this Risk Factors section. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d include Industrial Services of America, Inc. and subsidiaries.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur business has a major involvement in ferrous and non-ferrous metals. This market is extremely competitive and prices are volatile. Changes in prices, demand, including foreign demand, regulation, economic slowdowns or increased competition could result in a reduction of our revenue and consequent decrease in our common stock price.\nThe metal recycling business is highly competitive and is subject to significant changes in economic and market conditions. Metal prices were volatile throughout 2014 with increased volatility in early 2015. Pricing and proximity to a metal source are the major competitive factors in the metal recycling business. Volatility in the metals markets can adversely affect our revenues. Lower prices adversely affect revenues. Additionally, volatility can lower volumes of metal that our suppliers are willing to sell to us. Many companies offer or are engaged in the development of products or the provisions of services that may be or are competitive with our current products or services. Although we expanded our facilities and increased our processing efficiencies in previous years, certain of our competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and other resources and assets than we possess. In addition, the industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation, which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share or obtain our desired market share based on the competitive nature of this industry.\nVolatility in market prices of our scrap metal recycling inventory may cause us to re-assess the carrying value of our inventory and adversely affect our balance sheet.\nWe make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable value in order to assess that we record our ferrous and non-ferrous inventory properly at the lower of cost or market. We base our assumptions on historical experience, current market conditions and current replacement costs. If the anticipated future selling prices of scrap metal and finished steel products should decline due to the cyclicality of the business or otherwise, we would re-assess the recorded net realizable value of such inventory which could result in downward adjustments to reduce the value of such inventory (and increase cost of sales) to the lower of cost or market.\nWe are in default under our credit facility, and the lender could, among other actions, terminate the facility and demand immediate repayment of any outstanding debt.\nEvents of default have occurred under the credit facility which permits the lender to increase the interest on the outstanding principal by 2%, to cause an acceleration of the maturity of borrowings, to restrict advances, and to terminate the credit facility. On March 17, 2015, we received a letter from the lender reserving its rights and asserting the existence of events of default under the credit facility relating to the failure to achieve the minimum EBITDA for the period ended December 31, 2014, failure to achieve the minimum EBITDA for the period ended January 31, 2015, and failure to deliver the required financial statements and compliance certificate required under the credit facility. As of March 19, 2015, the lender has decreased the borrowing base block, thereby increasing the availability of capital under our revolving line of credit by $350,000. We are charged $5,000 per week for each week in which we utilize this additional $350,000.\nOur credit facility provides that as a result of the events of default identified in the written notice of the lender, as well as the other events of defaults referenced above, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. While the lender\u2019s notice did not terminate the credit facility or demand immediate repayment of any outstanding debt and the payment of accrued interest thereunder, it does reserve the rights of the lender to do any of the foregoing or seek any other available remedies. There can be no assurance that these actions will not occur at any time as a result of the events of default referenced in the notice or the occurrence of other events of default.\nWe are in discussions with the lenders concerning the aforementioned events of default and negotiation of a resolution, which may include a restructuring of the credit facility, a refinancing of our long-term debt or a forbearance agreement to address the consequences of the defaults and to waive any events of default. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing resolutions will be obtained.\nOur auditors have reported that there are substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nMountjoy Chilton Medley LLP, our independent auditor, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, given our recurring losses from operations and debt default conditions as described above. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business.\nWe are currently in discussions with the lender under our credit facility regarding a resolution to the defaults, and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us resolving the outstanding indebtedness. Our failure to cure the defaults could result in an acceleration of the debt by the lender, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Since a substantial portion of our operating assets are subject to liquidation by the creditors, a liquidation could result in limited or no assets being left for the stockholders after the creditors receive their required payment.\nEven if we are able to refinance or extend our indebtedness, the substantial indebtedness we have incurred could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nEven if we are able to refinance or extend our indebtedness, our indebtedness could still have important consequences to us. It is possible that refinanced or extended debt will contain terms, such as more restrictive operational and financial covenants and higher fees and interest rates that are less attractive than the terms contained in the debt being refinanced or extended. Our substantial indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business and the general economy. In addition, we may be required to dedicate a substantial and increasing portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments. This could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other needs, and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry and capitalize on business opportunities. This may also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may have greater financial strength than we do.\nIn addition, we may not be able to fund our future capital needs, including necessary working capital, funds for capital expenditures or acquisition financing from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may have to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may be unable to obtain third-party financing on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity. Any additional debt would increase our leverage, which would reduce our operational flexibility and increase our risk exposure.\nThe restrictive financial and other covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the incurrence of such debt, and our increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to that on a recent historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness.\nWe have limited liquidity and may need to arrange for additional liquidity on terms that are unfavorable to our stockholders, if we are able to obtain additional liquidity at all.\nOur liquidity remains constrained such that it may not be sufficient to meet our cash operating needs. Our ability to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures is limited by the net cash provided by operations, cash on hand and the liquidity available under the credit facility. Additional declines in net cash provided by operations or further decreases in the availability under the credit facility could rapidly exhaust our liquidity. Our inability to increase our liquidity would adversely impact our future performance, operations and results of operations. Our liquidity problems have worsened as a result of the events of default under our credit facility. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into a settlement or forbearance\nagreement under our credit facility. There can be no assurance that a settlement or forbearance agreement will be entered into or that an amendment or waiver will be obtained.\nOur ability to obtain additional liquidity will depend upon a number of factors, including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions. We cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nDue to reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows, coupled with substantial interest payments, we may be unable to maintain adequate liquidity and our ability to make interest payments in respect of our indebtedness could be adversely affected.\nRecent declines in commodity prices have caused a reduction in our available liquidity and we may not have the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, therefore, sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service and other liquidity needs. We are currently evaluating strategic alternatives to address our liquidity issues and high debt levels. We cannot assure you that any of these efforts will be successful or will result in cost reductions or additional cash flows or the timing of any such cost reductions or additional cash flows. In order to increase our liquidity to levels sufficient to meet our commitments, we are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions including (i) dispositions of non-core assets, (ii) actively managing our debt capital structure, (iii) in- and out-of-court restructuring, (iv) minimizing our capital expenditures, (v) obtaining waivers or amendments from our lenders, (vi) effectively managing our working capital and (vii) improving our cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these transactions or that these transactions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations. We cannot assure you that any refinancing or debt or equity restructuring would be possible or that additional equity or debt financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our strategies will yield sufficient funds to meet our working capital or other liquidity needs, including for payments of interest and principal on our debt in the future, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations.\nAn increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are dependent upon fuel, which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis. Direct fuel costs include the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products used to operate our shredder, fleet of cranes and heavy equipment. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which include fuel surcharges from vendors. When we have experienced increases in the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products in the past, we were able to pass a portion of these increases on to our customers. However, because of the competitive nature of the industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers. In 2013, the nationwide average price for one gallon of regular gasoline decreased by twelve cents as compared to the nationwide average price for one gallon of regular gasoline in 2012. This same average decreased by another fifteen cents from 2013 to 2014. A significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business, which adverse impact would be magnified if combined with a decrease in revenue caused by a decrease in commodity prices.\nWe could incur substantial costs in order to comply with, or to address any violations under, environmental laws that could significantly increase our operating expenses and reduce our operating income.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including laws and regulations addressing materials used in the processing of our products. In addition, certain of our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures, in addition to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Material environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where we disposed of materials from our operations, which could result in future expenditures that we cannot currently estimate and which could reduce our profits.\nOur financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nWe have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions we made. Actual results could differ from these amounts. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long-lived assets, valuation allowances for accounts receivable, inventory, lower of cost or market, stock option values, liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental remediation and deferred taxes.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nOur success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our management team or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and continuing to grow our business at a rate necessary to achieve and maintain future profitability.\nThe concentration of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSales to North American Stainless, our largest customer, represented approximately 13.3% and 37.5% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We require working capital between the time we acquire scrap metal for processing and the time we receive payment for these goods. The loss of this or other significant customers or our inability to collect accounts receivable would negatively impact our revenues and profitability and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers. Downturns in the economy led to bankruptcy filings by many of our customers in previous years, which could occur again and cause us to recognize more allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, changes in economic conditions or any weakness in the steel and metals industries could cause potential credit losses from our significant customers, which could adversely impact our future earnings or financial condition.\nOur debt may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns.\nWe are vulnerable to higher interest rates because interest expense on certain of our borrowings is based on margins over a variable base rate. We may experience material increases in our interest expense as a result of increases in general interest rate levels. Upon a breach of covenants in our lending facilities, our lenders could exercise their remedies related to any material breaches, including acceleration of our payments and taking action with respect to their loan security. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with debt covenants under our primary credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank. From time to time, we have relied upon and will rely on borrowings under various credit facilities and from other lenders to operate our business. However, the recent financial crisis has adversely affected many financial institutions and, as a result, such financial institutions have ceased or reduced the amount of lending they have made available to their customers. As a result, we may not have the ability to borrow from other lenders to operate our business. We are in discussions with the lenders concerning the aforementioned events of default and negotiation of a resolution, which may include a restructuring of the credit facility, a refinancing of our long-term debt or a forbearance agreement to address the consequences of the defaults and to waive any events of default. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing resolutions will be obtained.\nSeasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather, which could decrease the collection and shipment volume of recycling materials.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock could depress our market price and diminish the value of your investment.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. If our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares, the market price of our common stock could significantly decline. Moreover, the perception in the public market that our existing shareholders and in particular Kletter affiliates might sell shares of common stock could depress the market for our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nIn recent periods, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur quarterly operating results or the operating results of our companies in the waste management or stainless steel, ferrous, non-ferrous and fiber recycling industry;\n\u2022\nChanges in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets or the stainless steel, ferrous, non-ferrous and fiber recycling industry;\n\u2022\nLoss of significant customers; and\n\u2022\nIncreases in materials and other costs.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.", "PERMNO": 83875, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "IDSA"}
