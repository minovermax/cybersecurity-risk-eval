{"cik": "1364954", "company": "CHEGG, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including on our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d or in other filings by Chegg with the SEC, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our business operations and financial results. Because of the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n\u2022The uncertainty surrounding the evolving educational landscape, the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of the student, and the demand for our evolving offerings make it difficult to predict our operational trends and results of operations.\n\u2022Our future revenue and growth depend on our ability to continue to attract new students to, and retain existing students on, our learning platform.\n\u2022If our efforts to build and maintain strong brands are not successful, we may not be able to grow our student user base, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business, key metrics, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways.\n\u2022We intend to offer new products and services to students to grow our business. If our efforts are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our current operations are international in scope and we plan to expand our international operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\n\u2022We face competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to increase.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n\u2022We rely on AWS and other third-party software and service providers to provide systems, storage, and services for our website and any disruption of such services or a material change to our arrangements could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we fail to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on our learning platform, or if platforms such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Firefox limit our access to advertising and marketing audiences, or the data required to effectively reach those audiences, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022Government regulation of education and student information is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\u2022Colleges and certain governments may restrict online access or access to our website, which could lead to the loss of or slowing of growth in our student user base and their level of engagement with our platform.\n\u2022If we become subject to liability for the Internet content that we publish or that is uploaded to our websites by students, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Computer malware, viruses, hacking, phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\n\u2022We may be subject to short selling strategies that may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Growth\nThe uncertainty surrounding the evolving educational landscape, the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of the student, and the demand for our evolving offerings make it difficult to predict our operational trends and results of operations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the evolving educational landscape, the COVID-19 pandemic, employment opportunities for students, the number of classes and the difficulty of the classes that the students take, and the demand and market for our products and services make it difficult to predict our operational trends and results of operations, particularly with respect to our newer offerings, and the ultimate market size for our products and services. If the market and demand for a comprehensive learning platform does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of this market, our business and prospects would be harmed. We face risks, expenses, and difficulties related to our specific business model, including the risks more fully described throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, which impede our ability to successfully accomplish the following, among other items:\n\u2022enhance and expand our Chegg Services offerings including developing new products and services;\n\u2022develop and pursue a profitable business model and pricing strategy;\n\u2022acquire complementary products and services to expand and enhance our offerings;\n\u2022attract and retain students and increase their engagement with both Chegg Services and Required Materials;\n\u2022expand our offerings internationally;\n\u2022prevent students from sharing accounts with other students;\n\u2022prevent students from misusing our products and services in ways that violate our terms of services, applicable laws, or the code of conduct at their educational institutions; and\n\u2022develop and scale a high-performance technology infrastructure to efficiently handle increased usage by students, especially during peak periods prior to each academic term.\nWe anticipate that our ability to accurately forecast financial results for future periods will be most limited at the time we present our second quarter financial results, which will generally occur midsummer and precede the \u201cfall rush.\u201d Additionally, we expect our results of operations to fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and difficult to predict. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be a good indicator of our future or long-term performance. The following factors may affect us from period-to-period and may affect our long-term performance:\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain and engage students with our offerings;\n\u2022changes to search engines and application marketplaces that drive traffic to our platform;\n\u2022the rate of adoption of our offerings;\n\u2022price competition and our ability to react appropriately to such competition;\n\u2022the strength of the economy and the availability of attractive employment opportunities for our students;\n\u2022the trend of declining college enrollment;\n\u2022the types of classes our students are taking and whether they choose to take those classes pass/fail;\n\u2022the number and difficulty of assignments that professors are assigning and the number of assessments that professors are administering;\n\u2022changes by our competitors to their product and service offerings, including price and materials;\n\u2022our ability to integrate acquired businesses, including personnel;\n\u2022our ability to identify and target sales of complementary products and services to our students;\n\u2022changes in demand and pricing for print textbooks and eTextbooks;\n\u2022the ability of our logistics partner to efficiently manage and operate fulfillment;\n\u2022disruptions to our and our fulfillment partner\u2019s informational technology systems, particularly during peak periods;\n\u2022government regulations, in particular regarding privacy, academic integrity, advertising and taxation policies;\n\u2022operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business; and\n\u2022general macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19.\nWe have focused in the past, and expect to continue to focus in the future, on expanding our offerings, in many instances through the acquisition of other companies, such as Busuu, Mathway and Thinkful. Our newer products and services, such as skills-based learning and language learning, may not be integrated effectively into our business, achieve or sustain profitability, or achieve market acceptance at levels sufficient to justify our investment. We have encountered and will continue to encounter these risks and if we do not manage them successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future revenue and growth depend on our ability to continue to attract new students to, and retain existing students on, our learning platform.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new students to use our products and services and to increase the level of engagement by existing students with our learning platform. The substantial majority of our revenues depends on small transactions made by a widely dispersed student population with an inherently high rate of turnover primarily as a result of graduation. The rate at which we expand our student user base and increase student engagement with our learning platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including, among others:\n\u2022our ability to engage students with our suite of Chegg Services and to introduce new products and services that are favorably received by students;\n\u2022our ability to produce compelling and engaging services, mobile applications and websites for students;\n\u2022the efficacy of our \"Learn with Chegg\" initiative and the ability of the enhanced personalization of our content to further retain and engage students on our learning platform;\n\u2022our ability and our fulfillment partner\u2019s ability to consistently provide students with a convenient, high- quality experience for selecting, receiving, and returning print textbooks;\n\u2022our ability to grow our skills partnerships with providers who link us to employers and their learners;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast and respond to student demand for print textbooks;\n\u2022the pricing of our physical textbooks and eTextbooks for rental or sale in relation to other alternatives;\n\u2022the rate of adoption of eTextbooks and our ability to capture a significant share of that market;\n\u2022changes in student spending levels or the number of students attending college; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, including generating word-of-mouth referrals.\nIf we do not attract more students or if students do not increase their level of engagement with our platform, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline. The student demographic is characterized by rapidly changing tastes, preferences, behavior, brand loyalty, and price sensitivity. Developing an enduring business model to serve this population is particularly challenging. Attracting new students depends not only on investment in our brand and our marketing efforts, but also on the perceived value of our products and services versus alternatives. If our efforts to satisfy our existing student user base are not successful or become less effective, or if the cost of such efforts were to significantly increase, we may not be able to attract new students as successfully or efficiently and we may not be able to retain existing students on our platform. As a result, our business, growth, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, even if we succeed in establishing brand awareness and loyalty, we may be unable to maintain and grow our student user base if we cannot offer competitive prices for our products and services or adequately prevent unauthorized account sharing of our subscription program services. If we fail to maintain and expand our user base, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to build and maintain strong brands are not successful, we may not be able to grow our student user base, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe our brands are a key asset of our business. Developing, protecting, and enhancing our \u201cChegg\u201d brands are critical to expanding our student user base and increasing student engagement. Strong brands also help to counteract the significant student turnover we experience from year to year as students graduate, and differentiate us from our competitors.\nTo succeed in our efforts to strengthen our brands\u2019 identities, we must, among other activities:\n\u2022maintain our reputation as a trusted technology platform and source of content, services, and textbooks for students;\n\u2022maintain and improve the quality of our existing products, services, and technologies;\n\u2022introduce compelling products and services;\n\u2022adapt to changing technologies and changes in the learning environment;\n\u2022protect user data, such as passwords and personally identifiable information;\n\u2022adapt to students\u2019 rapidly changing tastes, preferences, behavior, and brand loyalties;\n\u2022continue to expand our reach to students in high school, graduate school, and internationally;\n\u2022ensure that the student-posted content to our website is reliable and does not infringe on third-party copyrights or violate other applicable laws, our terms of use, or the ethical codes of those students\u2019 colleges;\n\u2022protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022convert and integrate the brands and students that we acquire into the Chegg brand and Chegg.com; and\n\u2022maintain and control the quality of our brand.\nOur ability to successfully achieve these goals is not entirely within our control and we may not be able to maintain the strength of our brands or do so cost-effectively. Factors that could negatively affect our brands include, among others:\n\u2022changes in student sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products and services;\n\u2022technical or other problems that prevent us from providing our products and services reliably or otherwise negatively affect the student experience with our products and services;\n\u2022concern from colleges about how students use our content offerings, such as our Expert Questions and Answers service;\n\u2022brand conflict between acquired brands and the Chegg brand;\n\u2022student concerns related to privacy and use of data in our products and services;\n\u2022the reputation or products and services of competitive companies; and\n\u2022students\u2019 misuse of our products and services in ways that violate our terms of services, applicable laws, or the code of conduct at their colleges.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business, key metrics, and results of operations in volatile and unpredictable ways.\nThe full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted because of many uncertainties, including the deployment and long-term efficacy of vaccines and ongoing infection rate surges. Governments and businesses have taken mitigation actions, including school and business closures, travel restrictions, and quarantines. These actions could continue to cause a general slowdown in the U.S. and global economy, adversely impact our customers and partners, disrupt our operations, and cause significant volatility in financial markets.\nWhile our overall business was not materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic may still have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations in the near-term. We are continuously monitoring our business and operations to take appropriate actions to mitigate risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there can be no guarantee that the actions we take will be successful. Should the situation worsen or not improve, or our steps or risk mitigation fail, our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nMost employees are currently working remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health of our employees is of primary concern and at this time and we cannot reasonably predict when our employees can return to our offices. We may need to take further precautionary measures to protect the health of our employees. Additionally, our management team is focused on ongoing planning for and mitigating the risks of COVID-19, which may reduce their time for other initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to employee inefficiencies, operational and cybersecurity risks, logistics disruptions, and other circumstances which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nA significant number of U.S. and international colleges ceased in-person classes during 2021 in an attempt to ensure the safety of their students. Additionally, according to The New York Times, total undergraduate college enrollment decreased 3.1% from the fall of 2020 to the fall of 2021, bringing the total decline since the fall of 2019 to 6.6% or approximately 1.2 million fewer students. Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue, college enrollment may continue to decline. Our business, growth, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of a continued decrease in college enrollment.\nAs students returned to school in the fall of 2021, we started to see a slowdown in the education industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a decline in traffic to education technology services, such as the ones we provide. A combination of variants, increased employment opportunities and compensation, along with fatigue, all led to significantly fewer enrollments than expected. Moreover, those students who have enrolled are taking fewer and less rigorous classes and are receiving less graded assignments. As a result, we experienced a deceleration in the growth rates of our services and revenues that may continue. Any reduction in the number of students accessing our learning platform could harm our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have forced colleges to pay heightened attention to alternative methods of instruction, including online learning and related concerns, such as proctoring exams. This increase in attention and demand may lead to additional scrutiny from the faculty of more traditional institutions, such as colleges or universities.\nWe intend to offer new products and services to students to grow our business. If our efforts are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain students and increase their engagement with our learning platform depends on our ability to connect them with appropriate products, people, or services. Part of our strategy is to offer students new products and services in an increasingly relevant and personalized way. We may develop such products and services independently, by acquisition, or in conjunction with third parties. In the future, we may invest in new products and services and other initiatives, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful. The markets for new products and services may be unproven, and these products may include technologies and business models with which we have little or no prior experience or may significantly change our existing products and services. In addition, we may be unable to obtain long-term licenses from third-party content providers and/or government regulatory approvals and licenses necessary to allow a new or existing product or service to function. If our new or enhanced products and services do not engage our students or attract new students, or if we cannot obtain desirable third party content, we may not grow our student base or generate sufficient revenues, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, student engagement with our website could decline, which may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend in part on various search engines to direct a significant amount of traffic to our website. Similarly, we depend on mobile app stores such as Google Play Store and the Apple App Store to allow students to locate and download Chegg mobile applications that enable our services. Our ability to maintain the number of students directed to our website is not entirely within our control. Our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or search engines could revise their methodologies to improve their search results, which could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our search result page ranking or in ways that make it harder for students to find our website, or if our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth could slow, including the number of subscribers to Chegg Services, student engagement could decrease, and fewer students may use our platform. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of students directed to our website could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur current operations are international in scope and we plan to expand our international operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. In addition to our employee base in the United States, we have employees in Germany, Israel, India, the United Kingdom and Spain, and we have retained professional employer organizations and staffing agencies to engage personnel in certain additional international locations. Our international operations subject us to the compensation and benefits regulations of those jurisdictions, as well as other employer duties and obligations, that differ from the compensation and benefits regulations and duties and obligations in the United States. Further, enrollments of learners from other countries requires us to comply with international data privacy and education regulations of those countries. Failure to comply with international regulations or to adequately adapt to international markets could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.\nWe intend to expand our international operations and presence, and to make our products and services available in more international markets. However, we have a limited operating history in international jurisdictions and expanding our international operations will require considerable management attention and resources to attract talented employees and students. Our expansion efforts into international markets may not be successful. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could constrain our operations, increase our cost structure, and compromise our growth prospects, including:\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt content for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages;\n\u2022local laws restricting students from accessing online education platforms such as ours;\n\u2022data privacy laws that may require data to be handled in a specific manner, including storing, processing, and encrypting data solely on local servers;\n\u2022varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure, and increased or varying network and hosting service provider costs;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor unions, employee representative bodies, workers\u2019 councils or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\n\u2022different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, difficulties in adopting and supporting new and different payment preferences, and collections issues;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition and practices which may favor local competitors;\n\u2022the ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights abroad;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, including, but not limited to, employment, tax, privacy and data protection, economic sanctions and export controls, U.S. and other anti-boycott authorities, anti-money laundering laws, and anti-bribery laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, complexities, and commercial infrastructures;\n\u2022risks associated with foreign tax regimes, trade tariffs, or similar issues, which could negatively impact international adoption of our offerings;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences, including the potential for required withholding taxes for our overseas employees; and\n\u2022regional and economic political conditions.\nIf we cannot address these challenges, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial conditions. Our ability to gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain and the distraction of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is seasonal, and increased risk from disruption during peak periods makes our operating results difficult to predict.\nWe derive a portion of our net revenues from print textbook rentals and, to a lesser extent, sale transactions, which occur in large part during short periods of time around the commencement of the fall, winter, and spring academic terms. In particular, we and our partners experience the largest increase in rental and sales volumes during the last two weeks of August and first two weeks of September and to a lesser degree in December and January. The increased volume of orders that we process during these limited periods of time means that any shortfalls or disruptions in our operations during these peak periods will have a disproportionately large impact on our Required Materials revenues. If our distribution partners limited their service or otherwise suffer from business disruptions during these peak periods, we may be required to find alternatives for delivery, which may be more expensive, or we may be unable to deliver textbooks timely. If there are delays in the delivery of our textbooks to students, we recognize less revenue from such transactions. Additionally, our students could become dissatisfied with such delays and discontinue their use of our service, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRevenues from Chegg Services, print textbooks that we own, and eTextbooks are primarily recognized ratably over the term a student subscribes to our Chegg Services, rents a print textbook or has access to an eTextbook. This has generally resulted in our highest revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year. As a result of this seasonality, which corresponds to the academic calendar, our revenues may fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter depending upon the timing of where we are in our \u201crush\u201d cycle and sequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons of our net revenues and operating results are not likely to be meaningful. In addition, should the current COVID-19 pandemic continue to worsen and colleges cannot withstand a prolonged shutdown, we may experience a shift or reduction in enrollments that could impact the seasonality of our business and further make our results of operations difficult to predict.\nWe face competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to increase.\nOur products and services compete for students and we expect such competition to increase. Chegg Services faces competition based on the particular offering. For Chegg Study, our competitors primarily include platforms that provide study materials and online instructional systems, such as Course Hero, Quizlet, Khan Academy, Bartleby, and Brainly. For Chegg Writing, we primarily face competition from other citation generating and grammar and plagiarism services, such as Grammarly. For Chegg Math Solver and Mathway, we face competition from other equation solver services, such as Photomath and Symbolab. For Busuu, our competitors primarily include language learning platforms, such as Duolingo and Babbel. For Thinkful, we face competition from other online learning platforms and online \u201cskills accelerator\u201d courses both in the direct-to-consumer category, including General Assembly, Galvanize, Inc., Flatiron School, Codecademy, DataCamp, and Lambda, Inc., as well as white-label and co-branded providers who compete for adult learners through third party institutions, including 2U, Inc., Simplilearn, and Kenzie Academy. Additionally, the market for textbooks is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We face competition from college bookstores, some of which are operated by Follett and Barnes & Noble Education, online marketplaces such as Amazon.com, providers of eTextbooks, as well as various private textbook rental websites.\nOur industry is evolving rapidly and some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies, less stringent standards for user-uploaded content, and devote substantially more resources to marketing, website, and systems development than we do. In addition, a variety of business models are being pursued for the provision of print textbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than ours. We also face risks from strategic alliances by other education ecosystem participants. New competition may come from companies with greater brand recognition, and have significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. We may, in the future, establish alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors. To the extent such alliances are terminated or new alliances and relationships are established, our business could be harmed.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees, complementary businesses, products, services, operations, or technologies. To be successful, we must timely and efficiently integrate acquired companies, including their technologies, products, services, operations, and personnel. Acquired companies can be complex and time consuming to integrate and we may incur significant integration costs and we may not be able to offset our acquisition costs. Acquisitions involve many risks that may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including the risks that the acquisitions may:\n\u2022require us to incur charges and substantial debt or liabilities;\n\u2022cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022result in acquired in-process research and development expenses or in the future may require the amortization, write-down, or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill, and other intangible assets; and\n\u2022give rise to various litigation and regulatory risks.\nIn addition:\n\u2022we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures to integrate an acquired company;\n\u2022an acquisition may disrupt our business, divert resources, increase expenses, and distract our management;\n\u2022an acquisition may reduce or delay adoption and engagement rates for our acquired products and services because of student uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness;\n\u2022an acquisition may subject us to laws and operational challenges in new jurisdictions with which we are unfamiliar;\n\u2022we may not successfully transition acquired users to the Chegg platform and therefore may not realize the potential benefits of these acquisitions;\n\u2022we may incur unforeseen costs as a result of the pre-acquisition activities of businesses and technologies we acquire;\n\u2022we may be required to honor the pre-existing contractual relationships of businesses we acquire, which contracts may be on terms that we would not have otherwise accepted;\n\u2022it may be difficult to monetize any acquired products and services;\n\u2022an acquisition may not ultimately be complementary to our offerings; and\n\u2022an acquisition may involve the entry into markets where we have little or no prior experience.\nOur ability to acquire and integrate larger or more complex businesses, products, services, operations, or technologies in a successful manner is unproven. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. To finance any future acquisitions, we may issue equity or equity-linked securities, which could be dilutive, or debt, which could be costly, potentially dilutive, and impose substantial restrictions on the conduct of our business. If we fail to successfully complete any acquisitions or integrate them into our company, or identify and address liabilities associated with the acquisition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nWe depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the contributions of our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-Chairperson, Dan Rosensweig. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, meaning they may terminate their employment relationship at any time. If we lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our executive offices are located, and if we cannot attract or retain the personnel we need to succeed, our business may suffer.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced significant net losses since our incorporation in July 2005, and we may continue to experience net losses in the future. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $1.5 million, $6.2 million, and $9.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $337.2 million. We expect to make significant investments in the development and expansion of our business and, as a result, our cost of revenues and operating\nexpenses may increase. We may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses, and our efforts to grow the business may be more expensive than we anticipate. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including slowing or lower demand for our products and services, increasing competition, decreased spending on education, and other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, challenges, complications, delays, and other unknown factors, many of which are exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as we pursue our business plan. While Chegg Services revenues have grown in recent periods, this growth may not be sustainable and we may not be able to achieve profitability. To achieve profitability, we may need to change our operating infrastructure, scale our operations more efficiently, reduce our costs, or implement changes in our product and services offerings. If we fail to timely implement these changes or we cannot implement them for any reason, including due to factors beyond our control, our business may suffer. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability.\nWe rely on AWS and other third-party software and service providers to provide systems, storage, and services for our website and any disruption of such services or a material change to our arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on AWS and other third-party software and service providers to provide systems, storage, and services, including user login authentication, for our website. Our reliance makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays in their operations. Any disruption in the services provided by third-party providers, including AWS, could harm our reputation or brand, cause us to lose subscribers or revenues or incur substantial recovery costs and distract management from operating our business. Further, these third-party software and service providers may experience operational difficulties due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, including increased usage of their software and services. If they cannot adapt to the increase in demand or fail to ensure availability of their software and services, our ability to service users\u2019 requests may be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on our result of operations.\nAWS may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Upon expiration or termination of our agreement with AWS, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nOur wide variety of accepted payment methods subjects us to third-party payment processing-related risks, including risks associated with credit card fraud.\nWe accept payments from students using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal. As we offer new payment options to students, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and incidents of fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins. For example, we have in the past experienced higher transaction fees from our third-party processors as a result of chargebacks on credit card transactions.\nWe rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing and information storage of credit cards and debit cards. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, our business could be disrupted. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to additional fines and higher transaction fees; lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our students or process electronic funds transfers; or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience some loss from fraudulent credit card transactions, including potential liability for not obtaining signatures from students in connection with the use of credit cards or fraudulent payments to educators as part of Uversity. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot be certain that other fraudulent schemes will not be successful. A failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on mobile app stores and operating systems to grow our student user base and their engagement with our learning platform.\nThere is no guarantee that students will use our mobile apps, such as the mobile version of our website, m.chegg.com, Chegg Prep, and Chegg Study, rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our mobile apps with popular third-party mobile operating systems such as Google's Android and Apple's iOS, and their placement in popular app stores like the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, and any changes in such systems that degrade our products\u2019 functionality or give preferential treatment or app store placement to competitive products could adversely affect the access and\nusage of our applications on mobile devices. If it is more difficult for students to access and use our apps on their mobile devices, our student growth and engagement levels could be harmed.\nIf we fail to convince brands of the benefits of advertising on our learning platform, or if platforms such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Firefox limit our access to advertising and marketing audiences, or the data required to effectively reach those audiences, our business could be harmed.\nOur business strategy includes increasing our revenues from brand advertising. Brands may not do business with us, or may reduce their advertising spend with us, if we do not deliver ads, sponsorships, and other commercial content and marketing programs effectively, or if they do not believe that their investment will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. Additionally, if platforms such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, limit our access to or understanding of advertising and marketing audiences, they could reduce our advertising rates and ultimately reduce our revenues from brand advertising. For example, the release of iOS 14 on Apple devices brought with it a number of new changes, including the need for app users to opt in before their identifier for advertisers (IDFA) can be accessed by an app. Apple\u2019s IDFA is a string of numbers and letters assigned to Apple devices which advertisers use to identify app users to deliver personalized and targeted advertising. As more users opt out of granting IDFA access, the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns at the user level may become significantly limited and we may experience increased cost per registration. Our ability to grow the number of brands that use our brand advertising, and ultimately to generate advertising revenues, depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as the impact of macroeconomic conditions and legal developments relating to data privacy, advertising, legislation and regulation and litigation.\nOur core value of putting students first may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.\nWe believe that adhering to our core value of putting students first is essential to our success and in the best interests of our company and the long-term interests of our stockholders. In the past, we have forgone, and in the future we may forgo, short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of students, even if our decision negatively impacts our results of operations in the short term. For example, we offer free services to students that require investment by us, such as our Chegg Internships service, to promote a more comprehensive solution. Our philosophy of putting students first may cause us to make decisions that could negatively impact our relationships with publishers, colleges, and brands, whose interests may not always be aligned with ours or those of our students. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our level of student satisfaction and engagement, business, and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nHistorically, investments in our business have substantially exceeded the cash we have generated from our operations. We have funded our operating losses and capital expenditures through proceeds from equity and debt financings, and cash flow from operations. Although we currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional financing. Additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked, or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nOur business depends on general economic conditions and their effect on spending behavior by students and advertising budgets.\nOur business is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, which affect student spending and brand advertising. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal funding levels at colleges across the United States remained below historic levels, which led to increased tuition and decreased amounts of financial aid offered to students. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected federal and state budgets for education and caused significant economic volatility. To the extent that these trends continue, students may elect to not attend colleges and universities and reduce the amount they spend on educational content and textbooks. In addition to decreased spending by students, colleges and brands may reduce their spend on our advertising services. Any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are not able to manage the growth of our business both in terms of scale and complexity, our business could be adversely affected.\nAs we grow, the operations and technology infrastructure we use to manage and account for our operations will become more complex, and managing these aspects of our business will become more challenging. Acquisitions of new companies,\nproducts, and services create integration risk, while developing and enhancing products and services involves significant time, labor, and expense as well as other challenges, including managing the length of the development cycle, entering new markets, regulatory compliance, evolution of sales and marketing, and protecting proprietary rights. Any future expansion will likely place significant demand on our resources, capabilities and systems, and we may need to develop new processes and procedures and expand our infrastructure to respond to these demands. If we are not able to manage the growth of our business, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues as anticipated or recover any associated acquisition or development costs, and our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nGovernment regulation of education and student information is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur ability to deliver course content to students enrolled in Thinkful skills-based learning programs may be subject to state oversight including regulatory approvals and licensure for the course content, the faculty members teaching the content, and the recruiting, admissions, and marketing activities associated with the business. Thinkful's efforts to obtain necessary approvals and licenses began prior to our acquisition of the business and continues following the acquisition. We monitor changes to the state regulatory requirements applicable to our business activities, including Thinkful; however, if we do not obtain the appropriate licenses or address evolving state requirements, it may result in governmental or regulatory proceedings or actions by private litigants, which could potentially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business may also be subject to laws specific to students, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the Delaware Higher Education Privacy Act, and a California statute which restricts the access by postsecondary educational institutions of prospective students\u2019 social media account information. Compliance requires, without limitation, making disclosures, obtaining consents, and restrictions on transferring data for which we may in the future need to build further infrastructure to support. We cannot guarantee that we or our acquired companies have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction, due to lack of clarity concerning how existing laws and regulations governing educational institutions affect our business and lengthy governmental compliance process timelines.\nMoreover, as the education industry continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state, and foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, California adopted the Student Online Personal Information Protection Act which prohibits operators of online services used for K-12 school purposes from using or sharing student personal information, Illinois adopted the Student Online Personal Protection Act which went into effect on July 1, 2021 and regulates how we collect and process data, and Colorado adopted House Bill 16-1423 designed to protect the use of student personal data in elementary and secondary school. These acts do not apply to general audience Internet websites but it is unclear how these acts will be interpreted and the breadth of services that will be restricted by them. Other states may adopt similar statutes. Additionally, for-profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, remain under intense regulatory and other scrutiny. Allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against for-profit higher education companies, even if unfounded, could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation or decreased demand for our offerings.\nCertain jurisdictions have also adopted statutes, such as California Education Code \u00a7 66400, which prohibit the preparation or sale of material that should reasonably be known will be submitted for academic credit. These laws and regulations are directed at enterprises selling term papers, theses, dissertations, and the like, which we do not offer, and were not designed for services like ours which are designed to help students understand the relevant subject matter. Although we will continue to work with academic institutions to enforce our honor code and otherwise discourage students from misusing our services, other jurisdictions (including international jurisdictions) may adopt similar or broader versions of these types of laws and regulations, or the interpretation of the existing or future laws and regulations may impact whether they are cited against us or where we can offer our services.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in the use of the Internet particularly for educational services, including laws limiting the content and learning programs that we can offer, and the audiences that we can offer that content to, may decrease demand for our service offerings and increase our cost of doing business. Future regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs, and result in additional historical or future liabilities for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our results of operations.\nWhile we expect and plan for new laws, regulations, and standards to be adopted over time that will be directly applicable to the Internet and to our student-focused activities, any existing or new legislation applicable to our business could\nexpose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations and potential penalties or fees for non-compliance, and could negatively impact the growth in the use of the Internet for educational purposes and for our services in particular. We may also run the risk of retroactive application of new laws to our business practices that could result in liability or losses. Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to change previous regulatory schemes or choose to regulate transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified, and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nColleges and certain governments may restrict online access or access to our website, which could lead to the loss of or slowing of growth in our student user base and their level of engagement with our platform.\nThe growth of our business and our brand depends on the ability of students to access the Internet and the products and services available on our website, in particular in non-U.S. countries. Colleges that provide students with access to the Internet either through on-campus computer terminals or Internet access points on campus could block or restrict access to our website, content, or services or the Internet generally for a number of reasons, including security, confidentiality, regulatory concerns, or if they believe our products or services contradict or violate their policies. If colleges modify their policies in ways that are detrimental to the growth of our student user base or in ways that make it harder for students to use our website, the overall growth in our student user base would slow, student engagement would decrease and we would lose revenues. Any reduction in the number of students directed to our website would harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we are required to discontinue certain of our current marketing activities, our ability to attract new students may be adversely affected.\nLaws or regulations may be enacted which restrict or prohibit use of emails or similar marketing activities that we currently rely on. For example: CAN-SPAM regulates unsolicited commercial emails and imposes civil and criminal penalties for abusive practices; the FTC imposes penalties on companies for misleading and deceptive marketing practices; TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment; and CCPA requires us to make certain disclosures regarding our marketing practices, allows consumers to opt-out of certain data sharing practices. Newly enacted laws such CDPA and CPA will place additional restrictions on our marketing practices.\nNotwithstanding existing laws, we may discontinue use or support of these activities if we become concerned that students or potential students deem them intrusive or they otherwise adversely affect our reputation, goodwill and brand. If our marketing activities are curtailed, our ability to attract new students may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. trade control laws that may impose restrict growth prospects and impose liability if we are non-compliant.\nAs a U.S. company with U.S. origin software applications, we are required to comply with U.S. trade controls. Our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which prohibit most transactions with embargoed jurisdictions or prohibited parties without a specific or general license from OFAC. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which restrict exports of software subject to the EAR to embargoed countries and prohibited parties. Although we have taken precautions to prevent our platform, services and software applications from being provided in embargoed jurisdictions and to prohibited parties, and we continue to enhance our policies and procedures relating to sanctions and export compliance, we may not be able to prevent all transactions that are noncompliant with U.S. trade controls. Sanctions and export violations can result in significant fines or penalties, as well as reputational harm and loss of business.\nOur customers outside of the United States generated approximately 11.1% of our net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and customer base across all major global markets. An escalation in sanctions or export controls against regions where we operate, or the issuance of new sanctions designations or export restrictions against individuals and entities located in various regions, could result in decreased ability to provide our platform, services and software applications to existing or potential customers. Any limitation on our ability to operate in various global markets could adversely affect our business performance and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Taxes and Accounting Matters\nWe may be subject to greater than anticipated liabilities for income, property, sales, and other taxes, and any successful action by federal, state, foreign, or other authorities to collect additional taxes could adversely harm our business.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state and foreign tax authorities and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing and allocating income from our intercompany transactions, which could increase our worldwide effective income tax rate. We collect sales taxes in all U.S. states with a sales tax and most local jurisdictions on our sales, rentals, and digital services sold through our commerce system including sales and rentals on behalf of our third-party publishers. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al ruled that a state can require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales and use tax on sales made to the state\u2019s residents. It is possible that such taxes could be assessed by certain states retroactively for periods before the Wayfair decision on acquired products that are not sold through our commerce system. Any successful action by federal, state, foreign or other authorities to impose or collect additional income tax or compel us to collect and remit additional sales, use, value-added or similar taxes, either retroactively, prospectively or both, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses of approximately $660 million and $485 million, respectively, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2028 and 2022 for federal and state purposes, respectively. An immaterial portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards expired in 2021. At December 31, 2021, we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $21.4 million, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2030, and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $15.7 million, which do not expire. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. For example, we have net operating loss carryforwards of $25.4 million related to our previous operations in Kentucky that will expire unused unless we have similar operations in Kentucky. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, California\u2019s Legislature passed Assembly Bill 85 (A.B. 85), which suspends the use of net operating losses for tax years beginning in 2020, 2021, and 2022 for taxpayers with taxable income of $1.0 million or more before an application of net operating loss. A.B. 85 includes an extended carryover period for the suspended net operating losses with an additional year carryforward for each year of suspension. A.B. 85 also limits the utilization of business incentive tax credits for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022, requiring that taxpayers can only claim a maximum of $5.0 million in tax credit on an aggregate basis.\nThe 2017 Tax Act changed both the federal deferred tax value of the net operating loss carryforwards and the rules of utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards. The 2017 Tax Act lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for our 2018 financial year. For net operating loss carryforwards generated in years prior to 2018, there is no annual limitation on the utilization and the carryforward period remains at 20 years; net operating loss carryforwards generated in years after 2017 will only be available to offset 80% of future taxable income in any single year but will not expire. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act temporarily repealed the 80% taxable income limitation for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021; net operating loss carried forward from 2018 or later to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 will be subject to the 80% limitation. Also, under the CARES Act, net operating loss arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 can be carried back five years.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock and the stock of acquired companies, we have previously experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d under Section 382 and comparable state tax laws. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future issuances and other transactions of our stock. It is possible that any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of new U.S. and worldwide tax laws and our interpretations of those new tax laws, which are subject to significant judgments and estimates. The ongoing effects of the new tax laws and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of new tax laws. The new tax laws could have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes once we release our valuation allowance. Due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of new tax legislation, we may make reasonable estimates of the effects in our financial statements. As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the new tax legislation, we may make adjustments that could affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards that we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require us to make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters including textbook library, revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, and share-based compensation expense. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues and profit. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different methods to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. For more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates.\u201d\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we become subject to liability for the Internet content that we publish or that is uploaded to our websites by students, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a publisher and distributor of online content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, or trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute. We also may face liability for content uploaded by students in connection with our community-related content. If we become liable, third parties may initiate litigation against us and our business may suffer. For example, on September 13, 2021, Pearson Education, Inc. (Pearson) filed a complaint captioned Pearson Education, Inc. v. Chegg, Inc. (Pearson Complaint) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company (Case 2:21-cv-16866), alleging infringement of Pearson\u2019s registered copyrights and exclusive rights under copyright in violation of the United States Copyright Act. Others may send us communications that make allegations without initiating litigation. We have in the past and may in the future receive such communications, which we assess on a case-by-case basis. We may elect not to respond to the communication if we believe it is without merit or we may try to resolve disputes out-of-court by removing content or services we offer or paying licensing or other fees. If we cannot resolve such disputes, litigation may result. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly, divert our technical and management personnel, render us unable to use our current website or to market our service or sell our products and therefore harm our results of operations. We may not be adequately insured to cover claims of these types or indemnified for all liability that may be imposed on us. Any adverse publicity resulting from actual or potential litigation may also materially and adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain content usage review systems that, through a combination of manual and automated blocks, monitor for and make us aware of potentially infringing content on our platform. Nevertheless, claims may continue to be brought and threatened against us for negligence, intellectual property infringement, or other theories and there is no guarantee that we will be able to resolve any such claims quickly and without damage to our business, our reputation or our operations. From time to time, we have been subject to copyright infringement claims, some of which we have settled. While these settlements have not had a material impact on our financial condition, we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future and the outcome of any such lawsuits may not be favorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nChanges in or our failure to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) could harm our business.\nThe DMCA has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting or for listing or linking to, content or third-party websites that include materials or other content that infringe copyrights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, provided we comply with the strict statutory requirements of the DMCA. The interpretations of the statutory requirements of the DMCA are constantly being modified by court rulings and industry practice. Accordingly, if we fail to comply with such statutory requirements or if the interpretations of the DMCA change, we may be subject to potential liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, content or third-party websites that include materials or other content that infringe copyrights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property and our other proprietary business information. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies or the steps we take to enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. If the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to customers and potential customers may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract customers may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may challenge any patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights owned or held by us. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement, misappropriation, or other violation without substantial expense to us. Additionally, if we fail to protect our domain names, it could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for students to find our website, our content, and our services. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property or proprietary rights, an adverse decision could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property or proprietary rights, limit the value of our intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of third-party intellectual property license agreements. For example, we have entered into agreements with textbook publishers that provide access to textbook questions and other content for our Chegg Study subscription service. We cannot guarantee that the third-party intellectual property we license will not be licensed to our competitors or others in our industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements. We cannot predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain or renew such third-party intellectual property license agreements on commercially competitive terms could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property claims, which are costly to defend and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, third parties have alleged and are likely to allege in the future that we or our business infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Many companies, including various \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d or \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d devote significant resources to developing or acquiring patents that could affect aspects of our business. For instance, on November 5, 2018, a non-practicing entity (NPE) filed an action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned NetSoc, LLC v. Chegg, Inc., Civil Action No. 1:18-CV-10262-RAC (the NetSoc Action). For further information on this action, see Note 12, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the publishing industry has been and will continue to be the target of counterfeiting and piracy. We have in the past received and expect to continue to receive, communications alleging that physical textbooks sold or rented by us are counterfeit. While our fulfillment partner has systems for inspecting the physical textbooks in our catalog of textbooks, many of the textbooks sold or rented to students are shipped directly from our suppliers, and, despite inspection, unauthorized or counterfeit textbooks may inadvertently be included in the catalog of textbooks we offer and may be, without our knowledge that they are unauthorized or counterfeit, subsequently sold or rented by us to students, and we may be subject to allegations of\ncivil or criminal liability. We may implement additional measures in an effort to protect against these potential liabilities that could require us to spend substantial resources. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to sales of unauthorized or counterfeit textbooks could harm our business, reputation, and financial condition.\nSome aspects of our technology include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could harm our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute or use open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy\nComputer malware, viruses, hacking, phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our security measures or those of our service providers or companies we may acquire are breached or are perceived to have been breached, including cyberattacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, or if third parties obtain unauthorized access to our data, including sensitive customer data, personal information, intellectual property and other confidential business information, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address the problem. Any such events could harm our business, increase our costs, including due to litigation and enforcement actions, indemnity obligations, damages, penalties and costs for remediation, and damage our reputation or brand. Cyberattacks and security threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFor instance, in April 2018, an unauthorized party gained access to user data for chegg.com and certain of our family of brands such as EasyBib (the 2018 Data Incident). The information that may have been obtained could include a Chegg user\u2019s name, email address, shipping address, Chegg username, and hashed Chegg password. To date, no social security numbers or financial information such as users\u2019 credit card numbers or bank account information were obtained. Additionally, Thinkful, prior to our acquisition of it, discovered an unauthorized party may have gained access to certain Thinkful company credentials (the Thinkful Data Incident). If we, or companies that we acquire, experience security compromises that result in website performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites, or the actual or perceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, such as credit card information, users may be harmed or lose trust and confidence in us, and decrease the use of our services or stop using our services in their entirety, and we would suffer reputational and financial harm, in addition to increased regulatory scrutiny, litigation, fines, and governmental enforcement actions.\nAs part of our regular cybersecurity efforts, including enhancements to our cybersecurity controls made following our discovery of these prior events, we have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to protect our systems. However, efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement, may limit the functionality of our services, and we may need to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our safeguards and protection against security breaches or to redress problems caused by security breaches and such efforts may not be fully effective. Additionally, our network security business disruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses and losses related to direct attacks on our website or systems we use. Any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products and services and technical infrastructure, or the actual or perceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of the data we collect and develop may lead our users to lose trust and confidence in us or otherwise harm our reputation, brand, and our ability to attract students to our website or may lead them to decrease the use of our services or applications or stop using our services in their entirety. Any significant disruption to our website or computer systems we use could result in a loss of students or advertisers and, particularly if disruptions occur during the peak periods at the beginning of each academic term, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a security breach or other privacy or security related incident, we may also have obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to credit monitoring services, payment of significant fines, or payment of compensation in connection with a class-action settlement (including under the new private right of action under the CCPA). Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nComplying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises our, our users\u2019, our employees\u2019, or other confidential or personal information.\nAny significant disruption, including those related to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks, to our computer systems, especially during peak periods, could result in a loss of students and/or brands which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on computer systems housed in six facilities, three located on the East Coast and three located on the West Coast, to manage our operations. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience periodic service interruptions and delays involving our systems. While we maintain a fail-over capability to switch our operations from one facility to another in the event of a service outage, that process would still result in service interruptions that could be significant in duration. Such interruptions could have a disproportionate effect on our operations if they were to occur during one of our peak periods or if multiple of our service facilities experiences outages at the same time. Our facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events.\nOur facilities and information systems, as well as those of our third-party service providers, are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, cybersecurity risks including cyberattacks such as computer viruses and denial of service attacks, the failure of physical, administrative, and technical security measures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, human error, the financial insolvency of our third-party vendors, and other unanticipated problems or events. These information systems have periodically experienced and will continue to experience both directed attacks and loss of, misuse of, or theft of data. For example, on or about April 9, 2020, we had a breach in which an outside hacker may have illegally obtained personal information, including name and social security number, from approximately 700 current and former employees. We notified impacted employees and regulatory officials, and made a credit-monitoring service available, at no charge, to impacted current and former employees. Moreover, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity related incidents as a result of our employees, service providers, and third parties working remotely on less secure systems. While we have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems, in the event of a system interruption or a security exposure or breach, they may not be as effective as intended and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for related losses. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material effect on our company; however, there can be no assurance that attacks will not be successful in the future or that any loss will not be material. In addition, our information systems must be constantly updated, patched, and upgraded to optimize performance and protect against known vulnerabilities, material disruptions, or slowdown. The access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe also rely on Internet systems and infrastructure to operate our business. The information systems used by our third-party service providers and the Internet generally are vulnerable to these risks as well. In particular, we rely heavily on SaaS enterprise resource planning systems to conduct our e-commerce and financial transactions and reporting. In addition, we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting and cloud-computing providers, or interruptions in our own systems or in the infrastructure of the Internet, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could hinder our ability to operate our business, damage our reputation or brand and result in a loss of students or brands which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe collect, process, store and use personal information and data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, store, and use personal information and data supplied by students and tutors. We may enable students to share their personal information with each other and with third parties and to communicate and share information into and across our platform. If we were to disclose data about our student users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation and brand could be adversely affected, and we could face legal claims that could impact our results of operations. In addition, there are numerous federal, state, and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, using, processing, disclosing and protecting of personal information and other user data, including from minors under the age of 18, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. However, U.S. federal, U.S. state, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including the CCPA and CPRA, are rapidly evolving and may be inconsistent and we could be deemed out of compliance as such laws and their interpretation change. In addition, foreign privacy, data protection, and other laws and regulations, particularly in Europe and including the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, are often at least as restrictive as those in the United States. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them.\nFurthermore, foreign court judgments or regulatory actions could impact our ability to transfer, process, and/or receive transnational data, including data relating to students or partners outside the United States, or alter our ability to use cookies to deliver advertising and other products to users. Such judgments or actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results if foreign students and partners are not able to lawfully transfer data to us. In addition, some countries and states are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Any changes in such laws and regulations or a change or differing interpretation or application to our business of the existing laws and regulations, including the GDPR, could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and, particularly if our compliance efforts are deemed to be insufficient, result in additional historical or future liabilities and regulatory scrutiny for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue, and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches. For instance, following the 2018 Data Incident, a purported securities class action captioned Shah v. Chegg, Inc. et. al. (Case No. 3:18-cv-05956-CRB) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and our CEO. The complaint was filed by a purported Chegg stockholder and alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, based on allegedly misleading statements regarding our security measures to protect users\u2019 data and related internal controls and procedures, as well as our second quarter 2018 financial results. Such litigation, regulatory investigations, and our technical activities intended to prevent future security breaches are likely to require additional management resources and expenditures.\nAdditionally, the CCPA provides for a private right of action for security breaches that is expected to increase security breach litigation that could lead to some form of remedy including regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. If our security measures fail to protect personal information and data supplied by students and tutors adequately, we could be liable to our students and tutors for their losses, we could face regulatory action, and our students and tutors could end their relationships with us, any of which could harm our business and financial results. Further, on June 18, 2020, we received a CID from the FTC to determine whether we may have violated Section 5 of the FTC Act or the COPPA, as they relate to deceptive or unfair acts or practices related to consumer privacy and/or data security. Also, as of October 2020, we have received notices that an aggregate of 16,691 arbitration demands were filed against us by individuals alleging to have suffered damages in connection with the 2018 Data Incident. For further information on such actions, see Note 12, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy or data-protection obligations to students or other third parties, our privacy or data-protection legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause students to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as colleges and brands, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our student users\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws across multiple jurisdictions which are highly complex, overlapping, and which create compliance challenges that may expose us to substantial costs, liabilities, or loss of customer trust. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws could harm our business.\nWe have internal and publicly posted policies regarding our collection, processing, use, disclosure, deletion and security of information. Although we endeavor to comply with our policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be accused of having failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide commitments about data privacy and security can subject us to potential actions if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or otherwise misrepresent our actual practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with inconsistent or new privacy and cybersecurity laws could impact our business\nstrategies and the availability of previously useful data, increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, require changes in business practices and policies and adversely impact our business.\nPublic scrutiny of Internet privacy issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could deter or prevent us from providing our current products and services to students, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, display, processing, transmission and security of personal information by companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including the White House, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Commerce, have reviewed the need for greater regulation of the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online, and social media companies. On June 18, 2020, we received a CID from the FTC to determine whether we may have violated Section 5 of the FTC Act or the COPPA, as they relate to deceptive or unfair acts or practices related to consumer privacy and/or data security, as further described in Note 12, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Similar actions may also impact us directly, particularly because of the current subject of the CID and because high school students who use our Chegg Writing and Chegg Prep services, may be under the age of 18, which subjects our business to laws covering the protection of minors. For example, various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. Although our services are not primarily directed to children under 13, our Chegg Writing service or our Chegg Prep service, in particular, could be used by students as early as in middle school, and the FTC could decide that our site now or in the future has taken inadequate precautions to prevent children under 13 from accessing our site and providing us information.\nOur business, including our ability to operate internationally, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our websites, mobile applications, products, features or our privacy policy. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the use or disclosure of data that students choose to share with us or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained may require us to modify our products and services, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products and services that make use of the data that we collect about our student users.\nOur reputation and relationships with students, tutors, and educators would be harmed if our users\u2019 data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\nWe maintain personal data regarding students, tutors, and educators, including names and, in many cases, mailing addresses, and, in the case of tutors and educators, information necessary for payment and tax filings. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our users\u2019 data. However, despite these measures, if we or our payment processing services experience any unauthorized intrusion into our users\u2019 data, current and potential users may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to engage with our platform, we could face legal claims and our business and reputation could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u2022our announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected results or our announcement of revenues or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts, including unfavorable reports or change in recommendation or downgrading of our common stock;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technologies, acquisitions, strategic relationships and partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the economic performance or market valuations of actual or perceived comparable companies;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors, and existing stockholders or the anticipation of such sales;\n\u2022issuances of additional shares of our common stock or convertible instruments in connection with acquisitions and capital raising transactions;\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares, including any common stock issued upon conversion of the notes;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, students, colleges, brands, publishers, or our competitors;\n\u2022the U.S. political climate, with a focus on cutting budgets, higher education, and taxation;\n\u2022terrorist attacks or natural disasters or similar events impacting countries where we operate; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, both domestic and international stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of companies in general and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Technology companies have been particularly susceptible to stock price volatility. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been and may continue to be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to short selling strategies that may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares. Because it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects, and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum. Short sellers can publicly attack a company\u2019s reputation and business on a broader scale via online postings. In the past, the publication of such commentary about us by a disclosed short seller has precipitated a decline in the market price of our common stock, and future similar efforts by other short sellers may have similar effects.\nIn addition, if we are subject to unfavorable allegations promoted by short sellers, even if untrue, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and defend ourselves from possible shareholder suits prompted by such allegations, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors can only be removed from office for cause and by the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022subject to certain limitations, our board of directors has the sole right to set the number of directors and to fill a vacancy resulting from any cause or created by the expansion of our board of directors, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022only our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders cannot act by written consent;\n\u2022our restated bylaws can only be amended by our board of directors or by the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation can only be amended by the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court.\nOur securities repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn November 2021, our board of directors approved a $500.0 million increase to our existing securities repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and/or convertible notes, through open market purchases, block trades, and/or privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, volume, and nature of the repurchases will be determined by management based on the capital needs of the business, market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement for $300.0 million and repurchased $100.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2025 notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate consideration of $184.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $57.4 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2023 notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate consideration of $149.6 million. As of December 31, 2021 $365.5 million remains under the repurchase program, which has no expiration date and will continue until otherwise suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason by our board of directors.\nRepurchases pursuant to our securities repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our securities repurchase program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our securities repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our business and service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase securities after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our securities repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes\nServicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or cash on hand to repay them, settle conversions in cash or to repurchase them upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase.\nIn August 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (2026 notes). The aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes includes $100 million from the initial purchasers fully exercising their option to purchase additional notes. In March 2019, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.125% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (2025 notes) and in April 2019, the initial purchasers fully exercised their option to purchase $100 million of additional 2025 notes for aggregate total principal amount of $800 million. The 2025 notes and 2026 notes are collectively referred to as the \u201cnotes.\u201d The notes were issued in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act . Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We may not be able to generate cash flow from operations, in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the notes, which may not be redeemed prior to September\n2023 for the 2026 notes, March 2022 for the 2025 notes subject to certain conditions related to the price of our common stock, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nHolders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted. If we elect to deliver shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, the issuance of our common stock may cause immediate and significant dilution.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing any future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversions of notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of notes.\nGeneral Risk Factor\nOur operations are susceptible to earthquakes, floods, rolling blackouts and other types of power loss, and public health crises, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. If these or other natural or man-made disasters were to occur, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of earthquakes, blackouts, or other power losses, floods, fires, telecommunications failures, break-ins, acts of terrorism, public health crises, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, inclement weather, shelving accidents, or similar events. Our executive offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an earthquake-sensitive area and susceptible to wildfires. If floods, fire, inclement weather including extreme rain, wind, heat, or cold, or accidents due to human error were to occur and cause damage to our properties or textbook library, or our distribution partners\u2019 ability to fulfill orders for print textbook rentals and sales, our results of operations would suffer, especially if such events were to occur during peak periods. We may not be able to effectively shift our operations due to disruptions arising from the occurrence of such events, and our business and results of operations could be affected adversely as a result. Moreover, damage to or total destruction of our executive offices resulting from earthquakes may not be covered in whole or in part by any insurance we may have.", "PERMNO": 14273, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CHGG"}
