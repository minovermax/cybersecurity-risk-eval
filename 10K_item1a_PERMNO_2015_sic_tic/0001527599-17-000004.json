{"cik": "1527599", "company": "Mirna Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this periodic report, including our financial statements and notes thereto and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives\nOur business to date has been almost entirely dependent on the success of MRX34, and we have decided to discontinue further development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline and devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, which may not be successful.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development of MRX34, which was our only product candidate to enter in clinical trials. On September 20, 2016, we voluntarily halted the Phase 1 trial following multiple immune-related SAEs and the IND for MRX34 was placed on full clinical hold. In November 2016, we discontinued research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that our process to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives will result in any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction, or if made what the terms thereof will be or that any transaction will be approved or consummated. If any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction is received, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that, if a definitive agreement is executed, the transaction will be consummated. In addition, there can be no assurance that any transaction, involving our company and/or assets, that is consummated would enhance shareholder value. There can be no assurance that this transaction would enhance shareholder value. There also can be no assurance that we will conduct further drug research or development activities in the future.\nAny such strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near-and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nhigher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of our company or any acquired businesses.\nIf we do not successfully consummate a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the process to identify a strategic transaction will result in a successfully consummated transaction. If no transaction is completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our\noperations while we evaluate our strategic alternatives. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) obligations under our employment and related agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our company; (ii) potential litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) non-cancelable facility lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of a strategic transaction.\nOur ability to successfully complete a strategic transaction depends in large part on our ability to retain certain of our remaining personnel, particularly Paul Lammers, M.D., M.Sc., our president and chief executive officer. Despite our efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees could potentially harm our ability to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, as well as fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not generated any product revenues and we do not expect to generate any product revenues for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses in each year since our founding in 2007 and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses is uncertain. None of our product candidates has been approved for sale. We have historically devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including our preclinical and nonclinical development activities. In November 2016, we discontinued research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. To date, we have derived all of our funding from our collaboration with our former parent company, Asuragen, Inc., or Asuragen, private and public placements of our capital stock and government grants for research and development. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $26.3 million. Since inception, we have incurred net losses leading to an accumulated deficit of approximately $102.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we evaluate strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether we will become profitable.\nOur short operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 2007 and did not exist as a standalone company until 2009. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying and evaluating potential product candidates and delivery technologies, undertaking nonclinical studies, filing an IND application with the FDA, and conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of MRX34. None of our product candidates are in clinical development and, in November 2016, we discontinued our research and development activities relating to our product candidates that were in preclinical development. We have not demonstrated our ability to initiate clinical trials for product candidates other than MRX34, or successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes many years to develop one new product candidate from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions\nabout our future success or viability, or any evaluation of our business or prospects, may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown challenges.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Commercialization\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Certain oligonucleotide therapeutics and liposomal drug delivery products have shown injection site reactions, infusion reactions, and pro-inflammatory effects, and may also lead to organ dysfunction, including impairment of kidney or liver function. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce similar adverse events. Patients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have product liability insurance that we feel is appropriate for our stage of development, which covers clinical trials in the United States, for up to $1 million per occurrence, up to an aggregate limit of $5 million; however, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Our product liability insurance policy for clinical trials completed in the United States expires on December 31, 2017. In addition, we have product liability insurance, which covers clinical trials in the Republic of Korea, for up to KRW 625,000,000 per occurrence, or approximately $500,000, up to an aggregate limit of KRW 2,500,000,000 or approximately $2,000,000. Our product liability insurance policy for clinical trials completed in the Republic of Korea includes one additional year of coverage expiring on October 11, 2017. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product candidates or products causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;\n\u2022\nan increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products and our technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to our product candidates, we may not be able to do so.\nWe may attempt to form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic partnership for any product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. This may be because our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the competitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nIf we entered into a collaboration, we may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nIf we enter into a collaboration with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration would be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncollaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\nany such collaboration may require us to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current product candidates, potential products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates if the collaborators view our product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time-consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\nthe collaborations may not result in us achieving revenues to justify such transactions; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to resume further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nReliance on government funding for our programs may add uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those programs and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the course of our development of our product candidates, we have been funded in significant part through federal and state grants, including but not limited to the substantial funding we have received from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT. In addition to the funding we have received to date, we have in the past applied for federal and state grants to receive additional funding. Contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government, state governments and their related agencies, including our contracts with the State of Texas pertaining to funds we have already received, include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022\npotentially require repayment of all or a portion of the grant proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event we violate certain covenants pertaining to various matters that include any potential relocation outside of the State of Texas, failure to achieve certain milestones or to comply with terms relating to use of grant proceeds, or failure to comply with certain laws;\n\u2022\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022\nclaim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022\nimpose qualifications for the engagement of manufacturers, suppliers and other contractors as well as other criteria for reimbursements;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022\nlimit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nIn addition to those powers set forth above, the government funding we may receive could also impose requirements to make payments based upon sales of our products in the future, if any. For example, under the terms of our 2010 award from CPRIT, we are required to pay CPRIT a portion of our revenues from sales of certain products by us, or received from our licensees or sublicensees, at a percentage in the low single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals a specified multiple of the grant amount, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent, subject to our right, under certain circumstances, to make a one-time payment in a specified amount to CPRIT to buy out such payment obligations. In addition, the 2010 grant contract also contains a provision that provides for repayment to CPRIT some amount not to exceed the full amount of the grant proceeds under certain specified circumstances involving relocation of our principal place of business outside Texas. See also \u201cBusiness-Strategic Partnerships and Licenses\u201d for a description of this CPRIT agreement, which includes a description of our obligations to make royalty payments.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. These and other provisions of government grants may also apply to intellectual property we license now or in the future.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u2022\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with any such requirements that may apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nRisks Related to Administrative Operations\nRecent changes in our executive leadership and any similar changes in the future may serve as a significant distraction for our management and employees.\nSince the beginning of 2016, there have been three changes to our executive leadership team. In May 2016, we transitioned our Chief Medical Officer from Dr. Sinil Kim to Dr. Vincent O\u2019Neill and, in June 2016, we mutually agreed with Dr. Miguel Barbosa that Dr. Barbosa would resign as our Chief Scientific Officer. Effective in December 2016, we terminated the employment of Jon Irvin, our Vice President of Finance, in connection with our restructuring as part of a plan to reduce operating costs. Such changes, or any other future changes in our executive leadership, may disrupt our operations as we adjust to the reallocation of\nresponsibilities and assimilate new leadership and, potentially, differing perspectives on our strategic direction. If the transition in executive leadership is not smooth, the resulting disruption could negatively affect our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs (if any) and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including the confidential medical information of clinical trial participants, we could incur liability.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors, if any, may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate information or data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRequirements associated with being a public company have increased and will continue to increase our costs significantly, as well as divert significant company resources and management attention.\nPrior to our initial public offering in 2015, we were not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or any securities exchange relating to public companies. We are working with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, the expenses associated with operating as a public company are material, particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies also requires considerable time and attention of management. In addition, the changes we have made, and continue to make, may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Because the JOBS Act has only recently been enacted, it is not yet clear whether investors will accept the more limited disclosure requirements that we may be entitled to follow while we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d If they do not, we may elect to comply with\ndisclosure requirements as if we were not an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d in which case we would incur the greater expenses associated with such disclosure requirements.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after the completion of our initial public offering, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the end of that fiscal year, or if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d immediately.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for fiscal year 2016, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We will be evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on, and eventually allow our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and eventual auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The aforementioned auditor attestation requirements will not apply to us until we are no longer considered an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Deficient internal controls could also cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and were not profitable in 2016 and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be further limited. We believe that we have experienced at least one ownership change in the past. We may also experience additional ownership changes as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Accordingly, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize any or a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nWe, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in\ncertain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, if we resume our research and development activities and integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, this would increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect such parties in our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are sued for infringing the patent rights or misappropriating the trade secrets of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding patent rights with respect to our technology or products candidates, including interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. We also monitor patent prosecution activities and pending applications of competitors and potential competitors in our field in order to identify third party patent rights that could pose a potential threat to our freedom to operate in the market with respect to our product candidates, once commercialized. We are currently pursuing and may in the future pursue available administrative proceedings in the U.S. or foreign patent offices to challenge third party patent rights that could adversely impact our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our current or future product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties, who may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future patent rights. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates and third parties could allege that our technology infringes such claims. Further, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s patent rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same\ntechnologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nParties making claims against us for infringement of their patent rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we could be required to redesign our infringing products or obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. It may be impossible to redesign our products and technology, or it may require substantial time and monetary expenditure, which could force us to cease commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees in the event we are found liable for willful infringement.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license patent rights to use, develop and commercialize our product candidates or our technologies from third parties or, in certain cases, we fail to meet certain development deadlines, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted rights to intellectual property that are important to our business and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future, if we resume our research and development activities which have been discontinued. These include our exclusive cross-license agreement with Asuragen, our exclusive licenses from Yale University, or Yale, Marina, the University of Zurich, and Rosetta Genomics Ltd., or Rosetta Genomics.\nOur existing license agreements, except our cross-license agreement with Asuragen, generally impose, and we expect that future license agreements (if any) would impose on us, various development, regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, and financial obligations, such as payment of milestones and/or royalties. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we may not be able to market products covered by the license. Our business could suffer, for example, if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. See \u201cBusiness-Strategic Partnerships and Licenses\u201d for a description of our license agreements, which sets forth the material terms and obligations, including a description of the termination provisions, under our agreements with Asuragen, Yale, Marina, the University of Zurich and Rosetta Genomics.\nAs we have done previously, if we commence research and development of product candidates, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance research or allow commercialization of product candidates, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology, if we resume our research and development activities. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed arise, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us. However, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Generally, the loss of any one of our current licenses, or any other license we may acquire in the future, could prevent or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates and thus materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe were previously involved in discussions with Yale regarding the inventorship and ownership of certain patents and patent applications licensed to us by Asuragen. An independent third party expert was engaged to determine the inventorship and the ownership of patents and patent applications potentially subject to Yale and Asuragen co-ownership. This determination confirmed Asuragen\u2019s sole ownership of the patents and patent applications where co-ownership had been under consideration and resulted in a determination that Yale should be removed as a co-owner of one of the pending patent applications, an action we are currently undertaking.\nAlthough we seek to protect our ownership of our patents and other intellectual property by ensuring that our agreements with our employees and certain collaborators and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring, for instance, such parties to assign rights in inventions to us, we may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents, in-licensed patents or other intellectual property. In some situations, our confidentiality agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships, and further, many of our consultants are currently retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and may be subject to conflicting obligations to these third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the ownership of rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions, arising, for example, from such conflicting obligations of consultants, employees or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ reputable law firms and other professionals and rely on such third parties to effect payment of these fees with respect to the USPTO and non-U.S. patent agencies with respect to the patents and patent applications we own, and we rely upon our licensors to effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we in-license. Even if we do not control prosecution and maintenance of our in-licensed patents, we may be responsible for reimbursing our licensors for some or all of the costs associated with such activities. If we fail to make timely payment to our licensors for such fees, our licensors may have the right to terminate the affected license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. We also employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with the various documentary and other procedural requirements with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or trade secrets of third parties or that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former or other employers.\nMany of our employees, independent contractors and consultants, including our senior management, have been previously employed or retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of third parties in their work for us, and do not perform work for us that is in conflict with their obligations to another employer or any other entity, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that an employee, advisor, consultant, or independent contractor performed work for us that conflicts with that person\u2019s obligations to a third party, such as an employer, and thus, that the third party has an ownership interest in the intellectual property arising out of work performed for us. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable personnel or intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report and others such as:\n\u2022\nannouncement of a strategic transaction, including the acquisition of our company or its assets;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to the receipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants;\n\u2022\nsuccess of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndisputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n\u2022\nlack of an active, liquid and orderly market in our common stock;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations regarding us.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market if we are unable to maintain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards.\nNASDAQ imposes, among other requirements, continued listing standards including minimum bid and public float requirements. The price of our common stock must trade at or above $1.00 to comply with NASDAQ's minimum bid requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ. If our stock trades at bid prices of less than $1.00 for a period in excess of 30 consecutive business days, the NASDAQ could send a deficiency notice to us for not remaining in compliance with the minimum bid listing standards. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, our common stock never traded below $1.00. However, if the closing bid price of our common stock fails to meet NASDAQ's minimum closing bid price requirement, or if we otherwise fail to meet any other applicable requirements of the NASDAQ and we are unable to regain compliance, NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock.\nAny delisting of our common stock could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Furthermore, if our common stock were delisted it could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and/or result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers, suppliers and employees.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2016, our officers and directors, together with holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 68.0% of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.\nIf our existing stockholders or holders of our options sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2016, we have a total of 20,841,393 shares of common stock outstanding\nIn addition, based on the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan, or 2008 Stock Plan, as of December 31, 2016, and including the initial reserves under our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or 2015 Plan, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options, outstanding but subject to vesting, or reserved for future issuance under the 2008 Stock Plan, 2015 Plan or ESPP will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules. We also filed a registration statement permitting certain shares of common stock issued in the future pursuant to the 2008 Plan, 2015 Plan and ESPP to be freely resold by plan participants in the public market, subject to the applicable vesting schedules and, for shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The 2015 Plan and ESPP also contain provisions for the annual increase of the number of shares reserved for issuance under such plans, which shares we also intend to register. If the shares we may issue from time to time under the 2008 Stock Plan, 2015 Plan or ESPP are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, by the award recipient in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain holders of approximately 13.6 million shares of our common stock at December 31, 2016 are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares purchased by affiliates. Sales of such shares could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to our initial public offering in October 2015, there had been no public market for our common stock, and an active public market for our shares may not be sustained. Further, certain of our existing institutional investors, including investors affiliated with certain of our directors, purchased approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock in our initial public offering and consequently fewer shares may be actively traded in the public market because these stockholders are restricted from selling the shares by restrictions under applicable securities laws, which would reduce the liquidity of the market for our common stock. If an active market for shares of our common stock is not maintained it may be difficult for our stockholders\u2019 to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable or it may result in volatility in our stock price. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies or in-license new product candidates using our shares as consideration.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nreceipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants, and the timing of payments we receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make under these arrangements; and\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president;\n\u2022\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u2022\na requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action, or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will specify that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nProvisions in our charter and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur employment agreements with our officers may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated in connection with a change of control of us, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur officers are parties to employment agreements providing for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately $2.5 million at December 31, 2016 for severance and other benefits in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change of control of us. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; therefore, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund our operations. In addition, the terms of any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies.\nAccounting methods and policies for biopharmaceutical companies, including policies governing revenue recognition, research and development and related expenses and accounting for stock-based compensation, are subject to further review, interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Changes to, or interpretations of, accounting methods or policies may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements, including those contained in this periodic report.", "PERMNO": 15787, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SYBX"}
