In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d above, you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the events highlighted in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be important to you, materialize, our business, results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to specific market risks due to our focus on agricultural lending.\nWe primarily concentrate our lending activities in the state of Wisconsin, which is to some extent dominated by an agricultural economy. Historically, our senior management\u2019s primary business lending experience has been in agricultural lending, with a specific expertise in and focus on dairy and dairy-related businesses. Although we attempt to maintain a diversified customer base and a diversified loan portfolio, we are more heavily dependent upon the agricultural economy than a typical commercial bank. At December 31, 2015, agricultural loans comprised $499 million, or approximately 66.8%, of our total loan portfolio.\nThe agricultural economy is subject to certain risks that are either inherently volatile or are beyond our ability, or the ability of farmers or other participants in the agricultural economy, to predict or control. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nWeather-Related Risks. Severe weather, including such things as drought, hail, excessive rain or other natural disasters, could impact the quantity and quality of feed necessary to support our borrowers\u2019 dairy operations and, in turn, increase their expenses. If significant adverse weather-related events occur, it could impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans and cause significant property damage, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\n\u00b7\nDisease-Related Risks. The operations of our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers depend primarily on their cattle. If the livestock were to contract an illness or disease, the borrowers would incur additional expenses, and the viability of their operations may be compromised if the disease is not properly managed. The existence of a widespread livestock disease or pandemic could have a significant impact on our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\n\u00b7\nReal Property Value. Our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers tend to grow and produce much of their feed as opposed to purchasing it from third parties, unlike many dairy farmers in other parts of the country. While this means they are often less subject to fluctuations in feed prices, they require more land. Accordingly, declines in real property values in the areas in which we operate could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers or an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, default and charge-offs, and could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on agricultural loans.\n\u00b7\nMarket Prices. Agricultural markets are sensitive to real and perceived changes in supply and demand of agricultural products, and given that approximately 90% of our agricultural lending is to dairy farms, the credit quality of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is closely related to the performance of, and supply and demand in, this sub-sector of the agricultural market. For example, the success of a dairy operation hinges in large part on the cost of feed and the price of milk. When feed costs are high and milk prices are low, it places a strain on our dairy borrowers\u2019 business, which may impair their ability to repay their outstanding loans to us.\n\u00b7\nGovernmental Policies and Regulations. Our agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation and management of the farm properties securing the loans and their cash flows, and government policies and regulations (including the availability of price supports for crops and other agricultural products (in particular, milk), subsidies, or government-sponsored crop insurance) are outside the control of our borrowers and may affect the successful operation of a farm.\n\u00b7\nChanging consumer preferences. The business of dairy farms and dairy-related borrowers is subject to changing consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns. Periodically, medical and other studies are released which raise concerns over the healthfulness of cow\u2019s milk in the human diet. As a result of studies or other cultural influences, the dairy industry could be affected by certain consumer concerns about dairy products, such as the fat, cholesterol, calorie, sodium and lactose content of such products, which could reduce demand for dairy products and negatively affect dairy related revenue.\nOur focus on local markets and agricultural lending creates credit concentration risks.\nCredit concentration risk is primarily related to the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay some or all of its obligations to us. Concentrations of credit risk occur when the aggregate amount owed by one borrower, a group of related borrowers, or borrowers within the same or related markets, industries or groups, represent a relatively large percentage of the total capital or total credit extended by a bank. Although each loan in a concentration may be of sound quality, concentration risks represent a risk not present when the same loan amounts are extended to a more diversified group of borrowers. Loans concentrated in one borrower depend, to a large degree, upon the financial capability and character of the individual borrower. Loans made to a group of related borrowers can be susceptible to financial problems experienced by one or a few members of that group. Loans made to borrowers that are part of the same or related industries or groups, or that are located in the same market area, can all be adversely impacted with respect to their ability to repay some or all of their obligations when adverse conditions prevail in the broader economy generally, in the market\nspecifically or even within just the respective industries or groups. For example, lenders who focused on certain types of real estate lending experienced greater financial difficulties during the recent recession than more diversified lenders or those with concentrations other than real estate lending.\nOur lending is primarily to borrowers located or doing business in Wisconsin. Furthermore, at December 31, 2015, we had certain loan-type concentrations of credit risk, specifically in agricultural lending, which are described in more detail in the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cBusiness-Lending Activities\u201d and \u201cBusiness-General-Market.\u201d Because of the concentration of agricultural loans in our lending portfolio and the volume of our borrowers in regions dependent upon agriculture, we could be disproportionately affected relative to others because these high concentrations present a risk to our lending operations. If any of these borrowers becomes unable to repay their loan obligations for any reason, our nonperforming loans and our allowance for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on local economy, and a regional or local economic downturn affecting Wisconsin may magnify the adverse effects and consequences to us.\nWe operate as a community-oriented business bank, with a focus on servicing both business customers and individuals in our market areas, which include our headquarters in Manitowoc, a full-service branch in Stevens Point, and a loan production office in each of Darlington, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, and Sheboygan. Although we have a primary focus on agricultural and business banking, future growth opportunities will depend largely on market area penetration, market area growth and our ability to compete for traditional banking business within our market areas. We anticipate that as a result of this concentration, a downturn in the general economy in our market areas, including Wisconsin specifically, could increase the risk of loss associated with our loan portfolio. Although economic conditions in our markets have been generally stronger than those in other regions of the country recently, there can be no assurance that such conditions will continue to prevail.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 66.8% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of agricultural loans. Volatility in certain commodity prices, including milk, could adversely impact the ability of those borrowers to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us. In terms of the dairy industry, milk prices have fluctuated. For the 15-year period ended December 31, 2015, the per-year average class III milk price (a weighted average price of all uses of milk in a particular milk order) in the United States paid to producers has ranged from an average low price of $10.42 per hundred weight (cwt) in 2002 to an average high price of $22.34 per cwt in 2014, according to the University of Wisconsin - Madison. \u201cHundredweight\u201d or \u201ccwt\u201d is a measure equal to 100 pounds of milk shipped. A decrease in milk prices may result in an increase in the number of non-performing loans in our agricultural portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings and capital.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets where we operate, as a large portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 67% of our aggregate loan portfolio, comprising our agriculture real estate loans (including agricultural construction loans), commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans, was primarily secured by interests in real estate predominantly located in Wisconsin. Additionally, some of our other lending occasionally involves taking real estate as primary or secondary collateral. Real property values in Wisconsin may be different from, and in some instances worse than, real property values in other markets or in the United States as a whole, and may be affected by a variety of factors outside our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions generally. Declines in real property prices, including prices for farmland, commercial property and homes in Wisconsin, could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services generally. Moreover, declines in real property values in Wisconsin could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans and could adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolio consistent with our underwriting standards. Our failure to effectively mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations.\nStrong competition could hurt our earnings and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits, which may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We also face competition for agricultural loans from participants in the nationwide Farm Credit System and much larger regional, national and global banks. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological\nchanges and the continuing trend of non-bank competition in the financial services industry. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market areas and targeted business segments, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe have benefited from strong relationships with our customers, and also from our relationships with financial intermediaries. As a result, our reputation is an important component of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to leverage our reputation for customer service and knowledge of our customers\u2019 needs and business to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in and outside of our local market areas. We strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. We aim to enhance our reputation, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities and markets we serve, who are able to connect with customers through on-site visits and knowledge of our customers\u2019 businesses, and who care about and deliver superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or by events beyond our control, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate, and our credit risk may increase if we succeed in our plan to increase our commercial lending.\nAt December 31, 2015, $213.7 million, or approximately 28.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Given their generally larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate. For commercial real estate loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent on income from tenant leases being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. For commercial and industrial loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and would adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments (consisting primarily of loans and securities) and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings). Changes in both the general level of interest rates and in the difference between short-term and long-term rates can affect our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWhile we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, including by seeking to originate variable rate loans and balancing the respective terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates may still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and liabilities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which could affect our earnings.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses totaled $10.4 million, which represented 1.39% of gross loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, and could decrease our net income or reduce our capital.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to\ncharge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties, and inaccurate or incomplete information could subject us to various risks.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with our customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.\nWhile we strive to verify the accuracy and sufficiency of such information, if this information is inaccurate or incomplete, we may be subject to loan losses, regulatory action, reputational harm, or other adverse effects on the operation of our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and on our relationship managers to maintain and grow our agricultural and commercial relationships; we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services and expertise of our founders and the other members of our management team who direct our strategy and operations, especially relating to our agricultural lending focus, and, we have benefited from our management\u2019s extensive banking knowledge and experience in this regard. We also rely heavily upon the talents, experience and customer relationships of our loan officers and have benefited from their expertise and relationship-building skills, especially with respect to our agricultural and commercial lending. Members of our executive management team and our seasoned loan officers could be difficult to replace. Our loss of the services of one or more of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLimits on our ability to use brokered deposits as part of our funding strategy may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nA \u201cbrokered deposit\u201d is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker, which includes larger correspondent banks and securities brokerage firms. These deposit brokers attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the country and internationally whose deposit decisions are based almost exclusively on obtaining the highest interest rates. We have used brokered deposits in the past, and we intend to continue to use brokered deposits as one of our funding sources to support future growth. At December 31, 2015, brokered deposits represented approximately 24.5% of our total deposits and equaled $164.6 million. There are risks associated with using brokered deposits. In order to continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy. In addition, banks that become less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or prohibited from accepting brokered deposits. If this funding source becomes more difficult to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on the FHLB borrowings, attempting to attract non-brokered deposits, reducing our available for sale securities portfolio and selling loans. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available or, if available, sufficient to support our continued growth.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The primary sources of our liquidity are customer deposits and loan repayments, in addition to borrowings. Our access to deposits and other funding sources in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms is affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing and\ndeposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. It is possible that we may not be able to detect security breaches on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase the costs and risks associated with any such breach. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by these incidents. Further, we outsource some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly we are dependent on the expertise and performance of our third-party providers. To the extent that our activities, the activities of our customers, or the activities of our third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on other companies to provide certain key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party service providers provide certain key components of our business infrastructure, such as data processing and deposit processing systems, mobile payment systems, internet connections, and network access. While we have selected these third-party service providers carefully, we do not control their operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide agreed-upon goods and services for any reason or their poor performance of services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third-party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nFollowing the integration of Fox River Valley, we may continue to attempt to expand our business in Wisconsin or other states through mergers and acquisitions. As with the merger with Fox River Valley, we anticipate that we will seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, the risks with the Fox River Valley transaction and other possible risk such as:\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u00b7\nunexpected delays, complications or expenses resulting from regulatory approval requirements or other conditions to closing;\n\u00b7\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nentry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers.\nWith respect to the risks particularly associated with the integration of an acquired business, we may encounter a number of difficulties, such as: (1) customer loss and revenue loss; (2) the loss of key employees; (3) the disruption of our operations and business; (4) our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; (5) possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; and/or (6) unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit.\nIn addition to the risks posed by the integration process itself, the focus of management\u2019s attention and effort on integration may result in a lack of sufficient management attention to other important issues, causing harm to our business. Also, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of an acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. We do not expect to comment publicly on possible acquisitions or business combinations until we have signed a definitive agreement for the transaction. Historically, acquisitions of non-failed financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and net income per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully keep pace with technological change, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry generally, and virtual banking in particular, could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nUpon completion of our initial public offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, monitoring and reporting requirements. There may be risks that exist, or that\ndevelop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives relating to our financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company, and we expect that the obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. These obligations increase our operating expenses and could divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Global Market, except for such requirements that we may elect not to comply with during the period we are an emerging growth company, which could require us to further upgrade our systems and/or hire additional staff, which would increase our operating costs. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs may cause us to incur losses. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the WDFI. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represented a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new federal CFPB, tightened capital standards, and generally increased oversight and regulation of financial institutions and financial activities.\nIn addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for more than 300 administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation. While some rules have been finalized or issued in proposed form, many have yet to be proposed. It is impossible to predict when additional rules will be issued or finalized, and what the content of such rules will be. We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. The Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and/or our ability to conduct business.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the recommendations of the International Basel Committee on Bank Supervision to strengthen the regulatory capital requirements of all banking organizations in the United States. The Basel III Rule will replace the existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings associations and U.S. bank holding companies, other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion which are not publicly traded companies), and all savings and loan holding companies. The Basel III Rule became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015, and the rules will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III Rule creates a new regulatory capital standard based on Tier 1 common equity and increases the minimum leverage and risk-based capital ratios applicable to all banking organizations. The Basel III Rule also changes how a number of the regulatory capital components are calculated. Any significant increase in our capital requirements could reduce our growth and profitability and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more\ninformation about the regulations to which we are subject, see the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by our regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We believe the net proceeds that we raised in our initial public offering are sufficient to permit us to maintain regulatory capital compliance after the merger transaction and for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or to address losses.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our operations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital if required by the Federal Reserve, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nIncreased FDIC insurance assessments could significantly increase our expenses.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, the Bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums the Bank will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. The FDIC recently increased the deposit insurance fund\u2019s target reserve ratio to 2.0% of insured deposits following the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s elimination of the 1.5% cap on the insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio and has put in place a restoration plan to restore the deposit insurance fund to its 1.35% minimum reserve ratio mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act by September 30, 2020. Additional increases in assessment rates may be required in the future to achieve this targeted reserve ratio. In addition, higher levels of bank failures in recent years and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put pressure on the deposit insurance fund. The Bank may be required to pay even higher FDIC insurance premiums than the recently increased levels, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments. Future increases of FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement actions under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including future acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies may negatively affect our performance.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, which could have a negative impact on our reported results.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the Bank\u2019s performance.\nThe Company\u2019s only source of funds to pay dividends is dividends or other distributions it may receive directly from the Bank. The Company\u2019s payment of dividends in the future, if any, will be subject to legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions (including with respect to junior subordinated debentures (and related trust preferred securities (\u201cTruPS\u201d)), which are senior to our shares of preferred and common stock and have a preference on dividends), and will also depend on the Bank\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. Dividends are payable on shares at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, and any regulatory restrictions.\nWe are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may be costly and time-consuming and may require expensive remedial action or other costs.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and the Bank are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments that both entities have made and the businesses in which they have engaged. Federal and state taxing authorities have over the past few years become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If not resolved in our favor, such challenges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nCounty may be unable to successfully integrate Fox River Valley\u2019s operations and may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquiring Fox River Valley.\nCounty and Fox River Valley entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that County would be able to successfully integrate Fox River Valley\u2019s operations and that the merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, and involve a number of risks, any of which could adversely affect, County\u2019s business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating Fox River Valley\u2019s operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning Fox River Valley\u2019s customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either Fox River Valley\u2019s or County\u2019s current business;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nAmong the factors considered by the boards of directors of County and Fox River Valley in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement were the benefits that could result from the merger. County cannot give any assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or even that they will be realized at all.\nFox River Valley will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Fox River Valley, and, consequently, the combined company. Although Fox River Valley intends to take steps to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Fox River Valley\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with Fox River Valley to seek to change their existing business relationships with Fox River Valley. Employee retention at Fox River Valley\u2019s subsidiary bank may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the bank or within the combined company following the merger.", "PERMNO": 15180, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ICBK"}
