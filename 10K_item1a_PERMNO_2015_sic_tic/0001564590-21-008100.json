Brexit.\n\u2022\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\u2022\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nIntellectual property protection for our products is important to our competitive position.\n\u2022\nOur business and competitive position are dependent on maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\n\u2022\nOur brand name recognition is dependent on trademark and trade name protection.\n\u2022\nIntellectual property disputes, which are common in our industry, could harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with personal information laws could result in penalties and reputational damage.\n\u2022\nPatent law changes could diminish the value of our patents.\n\u2022\nOur competitive position is dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection, which is limited.\n\u2022\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to damages from trade secret or breach of non-competition/non-solicitation agreements.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Need for Additional Capital\n\u2022\nOur substantial current and future indebtedness involves risk.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to service, repay or refinance our debt when due.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with loan agreement covenants could harm our financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe loan agreement restricts our operations and ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\n\u2022\nWe may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\n\u2022\nOur public company status is expensive and time-consuming.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\n\u2022\nOur key stockholders and management could exercise influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares may be freely sold into the public market.\n\u2022\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022\nIf analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price could decline.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in charter, bylaws and Delaware law may discourage an acquisition of us.\n\u2022\nOur charter has an exclusive forum provision, which could limit stockholder litigation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022\nOur operations, and those of our suppliers and customers, are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes and other events beyond our control.\n\u2022\nDisruptions in our information technology systems could harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\n\u2022\nEmployment litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.\n\u2022\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from certain risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. We incurred net losses of $51.1 million and $51.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. As a result of ongoing losses, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $316.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant product development, regulatory, sales and marketing and other expenses. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nSince 2008, our revenue has been derived primarily from sales of our Precision Flow systems and associated disposable products. Going forward, we anticipate that our revenue will be primarily derived from a combination of our Precision Flow products, our Oxygen Assist Module, their associated disposable products, and HGE. Our Oxygen Assist Module launched in the United Kingdom, select European markets, and Israel in late 2020. In addition, demand for our Precision Flow systems and Oxygen Assist Module may decline or may not increase as quickly as we expect. Our ability to generate revenue from sales of our Precision Flow systems and their associated disposable products, including those designed for use with our Oxygen Assist Module, or from any products we may develop in the future, may not be sufficient to enable us to transition to profitability and generate positive cash flows.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand our sales and marketing organization, develop, enhance and commercialize new products and incur additional operational costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. Furthermore, even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve or sustain profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, failure of our Precision Flow systems or our Oxygen Assist Module, to significantly penetrate existing or new markets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, our revenue is primarily generated from sales of the disposable products utilized with our Precision Flow systems, and we are therefore highly dependent on growing the installed base of those system for our success.\nWe began selling our High Velocity Therapy technology and our Precision Flow Plus systems in the United States and in select international markets in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales of our Precision Flow systems and associated disposable products accounted for substantially all of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. We expect that sales of our Precision Flow systems, our Oxygen Assist Module, and their associated disposable products will account for the majority of our revenue going forward. Our ability to execute our growth strategy and become profitable will therefore depend upon the adoption by clinicians and customers, among others, of our Precision Flow systems to treat both type I and type II respiratory distress and our Oxygen Assist Module to help maintain the pulse oxygen saturation, or SpO2, within the target SpO2 range over a significantly greater proportion of time while requiring significantly fewer manual adjustments to the equipment. Some clinicians may not adopt our Precision Flow systems because they have prior history with or a preference for other treatment options that are more established, such as NiPPV, or may be reluctant to alter their practice patterns and undergo the training required to enable them to treat patients with our Precision Flow systems. Some customers may decide to not purchase our Precision Flow systems if, among other potential reasons, they believe our pricing is too high or that alternative devices to manage respiratory therapy are either more clinically efficacious or cost effective than our product. For example, our Precision Flow systems are significantly more expensive than conventional heated humidified oxygen delivery devices.\nIf clinicians are not willing to change current practices to adopt our Precision Flow systems to treat respiratory distress and our Oxygen Assist Module to help maintain oxygen levels within a targeted range, our Precision Flow systems, and our Oxygen Assist Module may fail to gain increased market acceptance, and our business will be adversely affected.\nOur primary strategy to grow our revenue is to drive an increase in the adoption of our Precision Flow systems to treat spontaneously breathing patients of all ages suffering from respiratory distress in the hospital setting and our Oxygen Assist Module to help clinicians maintain oxygen levels within a targeted range. While the number of clinicians adopting our\nPrecision Flow systems has increased in recent years, there is a significant subset of clinicians who have not yet adopted our Precision Flow systems, and may never choose to adopt our Precision Flow systems for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding our Precision Flow systems, or to convince physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists that our Precision Flow systems are attractive alternatives to other treatment options for both type I and type II respiratory distress;\n\u2022\nour inability to convince current customers to purchase additional equipment;\n\u2022\nperceived inadequacy of evidence supporting clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness of our Precision Flow systems over existing alternatives;\n\u2022\nliability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nthe training required to use new products;\n\u2022\ninadequate product quality; and\n\u2022\nperceived high cost.\nFew clinicians have adopted our Oxygen Assist Module for use with our Precision Flow systems, in part because we only launched our Oxygen Assist Module in the United Kingdom, select European markets, and Israel in late 2020 and are presently seeking FDA approval of this technology in the United States. Clinicians may choose not to adopt our Oxygen Assist Module for similar reasons that clinicians may not adopt Precision Flow systems.\nClinicians, including physicians and other medical professionals such as nurses and respiratory therapists, historically utilize NiPPV to treat patients in respiratory distress and manual control to maintain oxygen levels within a targeted range. We believe that educating clinicians about the clinical and economic merits and patient benefits of our High Velocity Therapy technology as a viable alternative treatment for both type I and type II respiratory distress and our Oxygen Assist Module to help clinicians maintain oxygen levels within a targeted range are key elements for increasing the adoption of our Precision Flow systems and Oxygen Assist Module. If additional clinicians do not adopt, or existing customers cease using our Precision Flow systems or Oxygen Assist Module for any reason, including those listed above, or if we are unable to expand the use of our systems to treat both type I and type II respiratory distress, our ability to execute our growth strategy will be impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our products to achieve and sustain profitability.\nAt present, we rely solely on the commercialization of our products to generate revenue, and we expect to generate substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products, primarily our Precision Flow systems, our Oxygen Assist Module, and their associated disposable products. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock. In order to successfully commercialize our products, we will need to continue to expand our marketing efforts to develop new relationships and expand existing relationships with customers, to obtain authorization to market our products in additional countries, to achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and to develop and commercialize our products with new features or for additional indications, as well as acquire or develop and commercialize new products. If we fail to successfully commercialize our products, we may never receive a return on the substantial investments we have made in product development, sales and marketing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and quality assurance, as well as further investments we intend to make, which may cause us to fail to generate revenue and gain economies of scale from such investments.\nIn addition, potential customers may decide not to purchase our products, or our customers may decide to cancel orders due to changes in available care offerings, adverse clinical outcomes, inadequate reimbursement or productivity credits for procedures using our products, complications with manufacturing or the utilization of technology developed by other parties, all of which are circumstances outside of our control.\nFurther, demand for our products may not increase as quickly as we predict, and we may be unable to increase our revenue to the level that we currently expect. Even if we succeed in increasing adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new customers and developing and commercializing new features or indications for these systems, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in the respiratory market by commercializing our products currently in development as well as developing and commercializing additional new products through our research and development efforts.\nGiven the competitiveness of our industry, our future business prospects depend in part on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and product candidates, such as HGE, and new applications for products that offer improved performance and cost-effectiveness. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge from competitors that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our products. It is important that we anticipate changes in technology and market demand, as well as physician, hospital and healthcare provider preferences and practices, in order to successfully commercialize new technologies to meet our prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe might be unable to successfully commercialize our marketed products, including HGE, or obtain authorization to market new products. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate clinician and patient needs;\n\u2022\nidentify, retain, and manage third-party design and development firms where appropriate to accelerate development;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\nobtain and retain third-party licenses required for the development, commercialization, and/or utilization of new products;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory authorizations to market new products or product enhancements; and\n\u2022\ndeliver products at a price point that is both profitable and acceptable to the market.\nIf we do not develop and obtain regulatory authorization to market new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our internal research and development efforts and our outsourced third-party design and development initiatives may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to develop enhancements or new generations of our products successfully, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nAdditionally, we must carefully manage our introduction of new products. If potential customers believe such products will offer enhanced features or be sold for a more attractive price, they may delay purchases until such products are available. We may also have excess or obsolete inventory as we transition to new products, and we have limited experience in managing product transitions.\nWe face intense international, national, regional and local competition and, if we are unable to compete successfully with such competition, our revenue, market share and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe medical device industry generally and the respiratory market specifically, are characterized by intense competition and evolving industry standards. We compete with a number of manufacturers of non-invasive ventilation products for the treatment of respiratory distress, and on a secondary basis, with conventional heated humidified high flow oxygen devices that facilitate high flow oxygen delivery for hypoxemic patients, and to a far lesser extent, providers of other respiratory support solutions to enhance oxygen delivery such as non-rebreather masks and oxygen cannulas.\nOur most significant NiPPV manufacturing competitor is Philips Respironics. Conventional heated humidified high flow oxygen device manufacturers, such as Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and Masimo Corporation, are also potential competitors. In addition, some NiPPV and ventilator companies, including Philips Respironics, offer high flow oxygen delivery options on their NiPPV and mechanical ventilator systems. We expect that the market will become increasingly\ncompetitive in the future. Manufacturing companies compete for sales to providers primarily on the basis of product features, service and price.\nHGE competes in the technology enabled services and digital health industries, where some of its competitors include Livongo Health Inc., Vivify Health Inc., Propeller Health Inc., Conversa and Spire Health Inc.\nSome of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with greater resources than we have and more products and longer history in the respiratory market. Other competitors are smaller companies who have or in the future may benefit from a strategic investment or acquisition by one of our larger competitors. As a consequence, these competitors are able to spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Some of these competitors have:\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with healthcare professionals and customers including group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks;\n\u2022\nestablished distribution networks;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\ngreater history in conducting research and development, manufacturing, marketing and obtaining regulatory approval for respiratory support products; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, patent litigation and customer financing.\nOur competitors have significant development and clinical resources and can rapidly follow any innovations we bring to the marketplace. For example, our competitors could seek to obtain 510(k) clearance for expanded labeling of their products using our current or future High Velocity Therapy technology products as predicate devices. Even if our technology and business strategy is more effective than the technology and business strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products and services in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and business strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and business strategies. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, market share and financial results.\nWe have limited experience in directly marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to successfully expand our sales infrastructure and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have limited experience in directly marketing and selling our products in the United States. We transitioned to a direct sales organization in the United States on January 1, 2015, at which time our domestic sales organization consisted of approximately 17 sales and clinical personnel. As of December 31, 2020, our domestic sales organization has grown to approximately 118 representatives, consisting of both sales and clinical personnel. In parallel, we have grown the size of our marketing department and we launched a digital marketing campaign in March 2017. Our operating results are dependent upon our sales and marketing efforts. If we fail to adequately promote and market our products, our sales could significantly decrease.\nWe have limited experience directly marketing and selling our products in the United Kingdom, where we acquired our former distributor, Solus Medical Limited, on February 28, 2019, and we have no experience directly marketing and selling our products in other international countries. As in the United States, our operating results in the United Kingdom and other international countries are dependent upon our sales and marketing efforts in those countries, and if we fail to adequately promote and market our products, our sales in those countries could significantly decrease.\nWe have limited experience directly marketing and selling HGE\u2019s Software as a Service chronic respiratory disease management platform, and no prior experience selling services that potentially are directly reimbursable by payors or selling value-based arrangement to payors.\nIn addition, our future sales will largely depend on our ability to increase our sales and marketing efforts to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs. We believe it is necessary to utilize a sales force that incorporates a specialized group consisting\nof former respiratory therapists who have experience with our High Velocity Therapy products to support our customers\u2019 needs. Competition for sales representatives and marketing employees is intense and we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel to maintain an effective sales and marketing force. If we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nAs we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to our Precision Flow systems and our Oxygen Assist Module, we have and potentially will continue to need to expand and restructure our marketing and sales networks, as well as modify and improve our sales program offerings, such as our provision of bundled discounts involving the placement of Precision Flow capital units for use by the customer at no upfront charge in connection with the customer\u2019s ongoing purchase of disposable products. If the percentage of customers who acquire our technology in this manner increases relative to the percentage of customers who purchase our Precision Flow capital units through an upfront or financed payment, the percentage of our revenue derived from Precision Flow capital units may decrease. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales representatives and clinical educators, and ensuring our sales program offerings satisfy the needs of our customers. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. If we fail to train new hires adequately, if we experience high turnover in our sales force in the future, or if our sales program offerings do not satisfy the needs of our customers, new hires may not become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales. In addition, since we have a limited history with a direct sales organization, we may not be as effective or efficient in utilizing our sales representatives as other companies with longer histories utilizing a direct sales organization. As a result, we may be required to restructure our sales organization, which would be costly, may divert attention from management, and lead to both planned and unplanned turnover. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities and our educational initiatives domestically and internationally, we may be unable to effectively commercialize our products.\nWe conduct a range of nonclinical, as well as clinical trials, comparative effectiveness, economic and other studies of our products. Unfavorable results from these trials or studies or from similar trials or studies conducted by others may negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians and hospitals, which could have a negative impact on the market acceptance of these products and their profitability.\nWe expect to continue to expand our marketing programs in the United States and internationally, and to fund research and development activities, including additional investment in sponsored and investigator initiated clinical and nonclinical trials and studies. The purpose of these nonclinical and clinical trials and studies is to obtain clinical efficacy, economic, and comparative effectiveness information about our products in an effort to generate comprehensive clinical and real-world outcome and cost effectiveness data in order to obtain product approval and drive further penetration in the markets we serve. In the event that these trials and studies, or similar trials and studies conducted by others, yield unfavorable results, particularly those in which we target severely hypercapnic patients, those results could negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and payors, thereby compromising market acceptance and profitability.\nWe currently, and in the future may, manufacture a portion of the components of our products in-house and the inability to produce the components we manufacture in-house could cause significant production delays, an inability to meet customer demand and a substantial loss in revenue.\nWe currently, and in the future may, manufacture our products or a portion of the components of our products in-house. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in Exeter, New Hampshire. The operations at this facility may be disrupted by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelivery problems;\n\u2022\nfinancial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022\ninternal inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing equipment failure;\n\u2022\nsevere weather;\n\u2022\nfire;\n\u2022\nnature or man-made disasters;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ncomponent shortages; and\n\u2022\nFDA compliance or other quality-related issues.\nThere can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not cause significant production delays, an inability to meet customer demand and a substantial loss in revenue.\nSeveral of our components are sole source from either our own internal processes or outside suppliers. These sole source components have no immediate alternate supply channels. If we were to encounter a disruption in supply, we may not be able to find an alternate supplier or enter into a new manufacturing and supply agreement. A failure to find an alternate supplier or enter into a new manufacturing and supply agreement could result in an inability to manufacture our products and cause substantial loss in revenue.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, has and may in the future adversely affect our business.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurs, our business may be adversely affected. Such events may result in a period of business, manufacturing, and other disruption or, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an inability to scale our production to meet increased demand in a cost-effective manner or at all, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in certain disruptions to our business during 2020 and may in the future result in additional disruptions to our business. Examples of such disruptions include without limitation the following:\n\u2022\nThe health and wellbeing of our employees, including our operations and production teams, our sales representatives and clinical educators who may visit our hospital customers, as well as that of our distributors and suppliers, are at risk - if a critical threshold of our personnel, or the personnel of our distributors or suppliers, were to be diagnosed with COVID-19, placed in quarantine due to potential exposure to COVID-19, or need to care for family members diagnosed with COVID-19, such developments may result in significant business, manufacturing, or distribution disruption.\n\u2022\nAs we scaled production to meet increased demand, we have asked, and will likely continue to ask, employees and suppliers to work extended and unusual hours and we and many of our suppliers have onboarded, and may in the future onboard, a significant number of new personnel. While we require these personnel to complete all required training and education before they begin working, and we believe our suppliers, to the extent applicable, do as well, many of the new personnel do not have prior experience with the specific production skills they are being hired to perform and/or otherwise do not have prior experience manufacturing medical devices, and while we have not seen a negative impact to our quality management system or product quality to date, any of the foregoing may result in a negative impact on our quality management system and product quality in the future.\n\u2022\nAs we scaled production to meet increased demand, our employees or suppliers have in the past and may in the future change production processes or fail to document such changes to keep up with our production needs. While we have not seen a negative impact to our quality management system and product quality to date, these changes and/or failure to document such changes may have a negative impact on our quality management system and product quality in the future.\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services has been dynamic since March 2020, with extended periods of intense demand resulting in the rapid hiring of temporary employees and scaling up of production and inventory, followed by periods of reduced demand resulting in the reduction of temporary employees and scaling back of production and inventory. The result of these fluctuations in demand has and in the future may continue to drive unevenness in our operations and supply chain and we have experienced and may continue to experience unevenness and volatility in our hiring, production, and inventory levels, any of which can have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nDemand for our products has previously increased at the same time that we began to experience limitations in our supply chain, which has resulted, and may in the future result, in a shortage of supply, increased costs of products, materials, and components and delays in the timely delivery thereof, which has required, and may in the future\nrequire, that we pass through expenses or otherwise increase our pricing in certain instances for our customers and distributors. Some of our customers and distributors have rejected, and others in the future may reject, these pricing increases, negatively impacting our business. Similarly, the demand we placed on our suppliers at the same time their sub-suppliers began to face limitations led to our suppliers seeking to pass through expenses or otherwise increase pricing for products, materials, and components we required to meet our production needs, and this may occur again in the future.\n\u2022\nSome of our suppliers have been, and may in the future be, partially or, at times, wholly precluded from delivering to us products, materials, and components in the quantities needed on a timely basis, for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, an evolving understanding of how international, federal, and/or state authorities define \u201cessential business\u201d, their inability to remain open due to lost business in other parts of their portfolios, or because of international, federal, and/or state prioritization orders requiring our suppliers to produce for governmental entities and/or other manufacturers before they produce for us.\n\u2022\nWe have had to develop alternative sources of supply for certain products, materials, and components as a result of the partial or, at times, complete inability of some of some of our suppliers to meet our production needs. Although we have successfully been able to develop and validate these alternate sources of supply to date, doing so is time-consuming, difficult, and costly, and if we need to develop and validate alternative sources of supply in the future for any reason, including if any of our suppliers were to cease operations altogether, discontinue production of our key products, materials, and/or components, or go into extended backorder, we may not be able to do so in a timeframe acceptable to meet customer demand. Additionally, we have had to go to secondary broker markets for some of our alternative sourcing needs, which represent a greater risk for counterfeit products, materials and/or components. Although we were able to validate the products, materials and/or components we purchased from secondary broker markets to date, we may not be able to do so in the future which may result in a negative impact on our quality management system and product quality.\n\u2022\nCustomer demand has necessitated weekly and, in some cases, daily shipments of certain products, materials, and/or components from our suppliers to meet our production targets, and customer demand in the future may necessitate similar delivery frequencies. We have had to and may in the future have to shut down production temporarily if there are delays in the shipments of those products, materials and/or components.\n\u2022\nFederal authorities may restrict our ability to export products outside the United States, which could negatively impact our business, operations, and relationships with our international distributors and customers in a significant and long-term way that we may not be able to rebuild for an extended period of time, or at all.\n\u2022\nWhile we have priority shipping status with our carriers, we have experienced shipping delays throughout the United States and internationally, and as a result, there have been and may continue to be delays in our ability to ship our product to customers and distributors in a timely manner, potentially resulting in returned product, and we have faced and may in the future face extraordinary freight fees, including air freight fees and expedition fees for all modes of transportation.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions have impeded, and may in the future continue to impede, our ability to qualify and retain new suppliers or audit our existing suppliers, which may have a negative impact on our quality management system and our product quality in the future.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions and hospital limitations or denials of access for non-patients have impacted, and may in the future continue to impact, the ability of our direct sales team and clinical educators in the United States and United Kingdom and our distributors and suppliers in many other countries to access physicians and clinicians in order to train them on our products at a time when we are onboarding many new customers who have no prior experience using our products. We have been training our customers and distributors on our products through online training modules. We are not certain that these alternative means will be as effective as our standard training methods, particularly over the long term in terms of using our products on the full range of patients experiencing respiratory distress, including hypercapnia, or even using our products at all, and while we have not seen a negative impact to our complaint rates to date, we may see higher complaint rates in the future, particularly from new customers who are less familiar with our products.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions have prevented, and may in the future continue to prevent, physicians and other caregivers from traveling to attend our training programs, which has resulted, and may in the future continue to result, in fewer physicians trained in person on high velocity therapy, and in the United Kingdom and in Europe, on our Oxygen Assist Module.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions have impeded, and may in the future continue to impede, our ability to meet with distributors, negatively impacting our business in a number of ways, including without limitation our ability to train our existing distributors on new products such as the Oxygen Assist Module and HGE.\n\u2022\nSome of our hospital customers in the United States may in the future be unable to continue with business operations as usual or at all due to lost business in other parts of their operations, which may negatively impact or eliminate our business with these customers. Similarly, some of our distributors may in the future be unable to continue with business operations as usual or at all due to lost business in other parts of their portfolios, which may negatively impact or eliminate our business with these distributors and their customers in the countries they serve.\n\u2022\nWe have asked most employees who are not directly involved in our production, shipping, quality, regulatory, and product development efforts to work from home and, while we have not seen a negative impact so far, this could impact our ability to effectively plan, execute, communicate and maintain our corporate culture. The increase in working remotely could also increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations.\n\u2022\nStay at home orders implemented in March, April, and May of 2020 significantly restricted individuals from traveling outside the home, which limited our ability to hire new employees or backfill terminated employees; if additional stay at home orders are issued in the future, our ability to hire new employees or backfill terminated employees may be further impacted. Additionally, the federal unemployment compensation subsidy passed into law in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic created incentives for certain individuals to stay home rather than seek to enter the job market, which also limited our ability to hire new employees and backfill terminated employees. The federal unemployment compensation subsidy initially expired on July 31, 2020, then was extended in September at a lower rate, and is currently set to expire on or before March 14, 2021. Any further extension of the federal unemployment compensation subsidy may continue to limit our ability to hire new employees and backfill terminated employees in the future.\n\u2022\nOur competitors, potentially including companies that we have not previously considered competitors due to their historical operations outside of the respiratory space or even outside of the medical device space entirely, may in the future secure significant purchase agreements from the federal government or various states before we are able to do so, may be selected instead of us, or may be added to these agreements after initially being excluded, and any of the foregoing could limit our access to or preclude us altogether from those commercial opportunities.\nThe U.S. federal government has cancelled, and the U.S. federal government and/or state or international governments may in the future cancel contracts they have entered into with suppliers to procure competitive respiratory support technologies, thereby leaving those suppliers with significant inventory of components and/or finished goods and creating motivation for those suppliers to enter markets around the world with those devices at extremely competitive pricing; to the extent those suppliers and their products would compete with us, our existing business in markets where we already are established and/or our ability to enter into new markets may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nThe transmission risk of different respiratory support modalities for COVID-19 has not been studied extensively. Our assessment of the issue suggests that the Precision Flow, its disposable patient circuits, and its accessories, including the Vapotherm Transfer Unit, the Q50 compressor, and, in the United Kingdom and Europe, the Oxygen Assist Module, do not represent a heightened risk, particularly when (1) used in COVID-19 cohorts or when adequately disinfected between patients, and (2) a simple surgical mask is placed over the patient\u2019s nose and mouth while delivering high velocity nasal insufflation; however, this assessment could prove to be incorrect upon further analysis or new third party information.\n\u2022\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation that our promotional materials, sales practices, and training related to the use of our products on patients in respiratory distress who are suffering from COVID-19 are on label and they could request we modify our promotional materials, sales practices, or training or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to\nconstitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\n\u2022\nA significant disruption to our business resulting in an inability to build and ship product to customers for an extended period of time may impair our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.\n\u2022\nEquity and debt markets in general and Vapotherm securities in particular have experienced significant volatility since the spread of COVID-19 into the United States for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, media coverage of COVID-19, its impacts, and specific COVID-19 related technologies such as invasive mechanical ventilators and high flow nasal cannula in general and Vapotherm\u2019s Precision Flow, an advanced form of high flow nasal cannula capable of delivering high velocity therapy, in particular. Should significant volatility continue or should the markets in general or Vapotherm securities in particular experience declines due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to raise capital or seek other sources of financing at a reasonable valuation or at all.\nIn addition, the increases in demand we have experienced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are correlated with the number of patients suffering from COVID-19 who are being treated for respiratory distress; these increases in demand may not continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Moreover, the increases in demand we have experienced to date may result in decreased demand for our products after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides as hospitals may have a large surplus of ventilators and other respiratory support equipment, including high flow nasal cannula devices, potentially including Vapotherm\u2019s Precision Flow systems. Additionally, we were awarded a blanket purchase agreement from the Department of Defense and may in the future be compelled to or otherwise enter into other blanket purchase agreements or supply agreements with domestic or foreign governmental entities, and orders may not materialize thereunder for a variety of reasons, including without limitation, the COVID-19 pandemic subsiding or any decision by the relevant domestic or foreign governmental entity to otherwise cancel or alter their purchase order or supply agreement. Even if any such agreement is ultimately fulfilled, the domestic or foreign governmental entity might fail to adequately distribute and install our technology in hospitals where the potential exists for it to generate an ongoing disposable revenue stream. As a result, any present increase or potential future increase in our capital or disposable revenue may not be sustained and our revenue may significantly decrease after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any sudden and significant decrease in demand may result in a substantial inventory position, which could also have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to treat or contain COVID-19 or to otherwise limit its impact, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines among others. Additionally, strategies relating to limiting the impact of COVID-19 have become highly politicized around the world. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic, whether on its own or in connection with any political, economic, and civil instability adversely affects our business and financial results, our distributors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 business and financial results, or our customers\u2019 business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including without limitation those relating to our ability to generate revenue and improve on or hold our current gross margin, the price of our common stock, our susceptibility to securities or other types of litigation, our significant amount of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our substantial indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, our business may be harmed, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for respiratory support. Furthermore, if our customers are not sufficiently trained in the use of our products, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.\nRegardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nmaterial defense costs;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize new products; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from pursuing our business strategy.\nOur existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future. In addition, a recall of some of our products, whether or not the result of a product liability claim, could result in significant costs and loss of customers.\nIn addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely affect or eliminate the prospects for commercialization or sales of a product that is the subject of any such claim.\nOur sales volumes and our results of operations may fluctuate within each quarter and over the course of the year.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, which may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe number of products sold in the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe unpredictability of sales of capital equipment to our domestic hospital customers and our international distributors;\n\u2022\ntiming of our customers\u2019 capital budgeting cycle; and\n\u2022\nfluctuation and foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development and sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Our results of operations may not meet the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly.\nHistorically, our business has been, and likely again in the future will be, subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nAlthough we did not experience seasonality this year due to demand for our High Velocity Therapy technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, historically, our business has been, and likely again in the future will be, subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our revenue is typically higher in our first and fourth quarters, driven primarily by an increase in patients with flu-like symptoms and COPD exacerbations. Sales volume can be affected by the severity of the flu season and variations in the rates of respiratory disease in any given time period. In the event we had product shortages or had to institute a recall of our products during the flu season, our financial results would have an even more detrimental effect. As a result, our financial results for any single quarter or for periods of less than a year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nWe bear the risk of warranty claims on our products.\nWe provide customers with a one-year warranty on our Precision Flow systems\u2019 capital purchases, with limited exceptions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we incurred warranty expense of $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. We bear the risk of warranty claims on the products we supply. We may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by our suppliers or vendors in the event of a successful warranty claim against us by a customer or any recovery from such vendor or supplier may not be sufficient to cover our losses. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may arise after our ability to bring corresponding warranty claims against such suppliers expires, which could result in our inability to recover any costs incurred by us.\nWe no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31, 2020 and as a result, we have and will continue to incur significant additional costs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we no longer qualified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies no longer applied to us. As a result, we are no longer permitted to take advantage of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements afforded to emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we will likely incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those additional requirements, including the auditor attestation requirements for internal controls. Compliance with these additional laws, rules and regulations will likely increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. In addition, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may also need to hire more employees in the future or engage additional outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which would increase our costs and expenses.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous U.S. states, the United Kingdom and certain other territories. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws, changes in the mix of our profitability from state to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, and changes in accounting for income taxes. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nIf we become profitable, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant product development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and other expenses as well as increased administrative expenses. If we become profitable in the future, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, tax credit carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes may be subject to limitations. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to an annual limitation on its ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes. We have not performed an analysis to determine whether our past issuances of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in one or more ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in one or more ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. If an ownership change has occurred in the past or occurs in the future, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code. If we determine that we have not undergone an ownership change, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our analysis, and determine that our ability to use our NOLs, tax credit carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income are limited by Section 382 of the Code. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs, even if we attain profitability. A full valuation allowance has been provided for the entire amount of our NOLs.\nIf the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of our customers or their patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may be unable to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. For example, in February 2021, we upgraded the software on approximately 45 Oxygen Assist Module\nunits outside of the United States from software version 2.2.0 to software version 2.5.0. Subsequently, a bug in software\nversion 2.5.0 was discovered by one of our employees. Although there have been no reports of patient injury associated with\nthis bug and we believe risk of patient injury is unlikely, out of an abundance of caution, we immediately notified our users and\nundertook a field action to remove software version 2.5.0 from all upgraded units and downgrade these units to software\nversion 2.2.0 until the issue is resolved. All software downgrades have been completed. Despite the low risk we believe this\nsoftware bug engendered, and the absence of evidence of patient injury as a result of this software bug, there is a risk this field action could undermine confidence in the product and negatively impact adoption.\nAdditionally, if our products are involved in an instance of patient harm, even if it is through misuse of our products, it could result in an interruption of business and damage to our reputation.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions or investments in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, through the licensing of products or technologies from third parties or other strategic alliances. The failure to effectively manage acquisitions, investments, licenses or other strategic alliances, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures, technologies and market pressures. Accordingly, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire, make investments in or license other technologies, products and businesses that may enhance our capabilities, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. For example, on February 28, 2019, we acquired our former distributor in the United Kingdom, Solus Medical, providing us with a U.K.-based wholly owned subsidiary and direct sales organization. As another example, on November 13, 2020 we acquired HGE, a software as a service platform for ongoing management of chronic respiratory disease. Potential and completed acquisitions, strategic investments, licenses and other alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits, financial or otherwise, of the transaction resulting from issues with acquired products or technology, introduction of competitive products or technology with attributes superior to the acquired products or technology, the failure to achieve market acceptance of the products or technology, or a delay or failure to drive sales of the acquired products or technology to anticipated levels;\n\u2022\ndelays or other difficulty assimilating or integrating acquired or licensed technologies, products or business operations;\n\u2022\nfailure of the target entity to satisfy post-closing obligations;\n\u2022\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nfailure of pre-acquisition due diligence such that issues that negatively affect the value or cost structure of the acquired enterprise are not uncovered;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs, including the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities and the incurrence of debt or future write-offs of significant amounts of intangible assets, goodwill, and/or long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nimpacts related to contingent consideration payments;\n\u2022\nimpacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed contingent or other liabilities or problems, or unanticipated costs associated with the acquired entity;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business and disruption of ongoing operations;\n\u2022\ninability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential losses related to investments in other companies;\n\u2022\nloss of existing third-party license agreements or the ability to enter into new third-party license agreements for any reason, including without limitation a difference or change in one party\u2019s strategic direction;\n\u2022\nlack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business;\n\u2022\ninfringement by acquired business or other business ventures on valid intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nincreased legal and accounting compliance costs.\nWe do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions or strategic relationships we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such transactions on favorable terms, or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology into our business or retain any key personnel, suppliers or distributors. Our ability to successfully grow through strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses, technologies or products and, as necessary, to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations.\nAdditionally, we have and may seek to make additional foreign acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances which involve other unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures, languages and legal and regulatory environments, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nTo finance any acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may be unable to consummate any acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances using our stock as consideration.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe have been growing significantly over the past two years. Our revenue grew from $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $125.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to continue to grow our business operations and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including our supply chain operations, quality control, technical support and customer service, sales force management and general and financial administration. We may be unable to maintain the quality, or delivery timelines, of our products or customer service or satisfy customer demand if our business grows too rapidly, including into markets or countries in which we have limited or no prior operating and commercial experience. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. We may implement new systems in a number of areas affecting a broad range of business processes and functional areas. The time and resources required to implement these new systems is uncertain and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could harm our business.\nAs our world-wide commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for our supply chain, customer service, training and education personnel, invoicing, reporting and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. Because our products require us to devote significant resources to training our customers on the use and educating our customers on the benefits of our products, we will be required to expand these personnel as we increase our sales efforts. We may not successfully implement these increases in scale or the expansion of our personnel, which could harm our business.\nRemote Physiologic Monitoring support services provided by HGE present unique business and regulatory risks.\nHealth care providers pay HGE to provide RPM support services to help them remotely monitor the health and well-being of patients with certain chronic healthcare conditions. There are unique business and regulatory risks associated with these services, including, among others:\n\u2022\nPatient Enrollment/Attrition: The business viability of HGE\u2019s RPM support services is dependent on HGE\u2019s ability to work with healthcare providers to identify a target patient population and engage with them on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to continue to engage these patients and give providers information regarding their patients\u2019 health and well-being, providers may be less willing to pay for HGE\u2019s RPM support services.\n\u2022\nTherapeutic Adherence: The ability of HGE\u2019s RPM support services to help providers improve the health of a target patient population is dependent on patients adhering to their prescribed therapy and submitting certain measurements and information to our RPM platform. Patients\u2019 failure to adhere to therapy could undermine the utility of HGE\u2019s RPM support services and negatively impact our business model.\n\u2022\nChanging Coverage and Reimbursement Landscape: Our sales of RPM devices are affected by the ability of our customers to receive government and/or commercial reimbursement for use of the RPM devices. Coverage and reimbursement for RPM devices is evolving. While there appears to be growing awareness of the efficacy and utility of RPM devices, not all payors at this time provide coverage and reimbursement for such devices or the services provided in connection with RPM devices. Reimbursement requirements also are evolving. Changes in payor coverage and reimbursement that limit available RPM reimbursement for providers may materially impact our sales of HGE\u2019s RPM devices.\n\u2022\nInability to show savings in value-based arrangements: Under some RPM support services arrangements, HGE receives bonus payments from its health care provider customers tied to the providers\u2019 abilities to improve quality or reduce costs. If our HGE RPM services do not assist providers in meeting certain quality or cost metrics, our payments associated with such RPM devices may be reduced or we may not realize the potential financial gain associated with those RPM devices.\n\u2022\nCompliance with Health Care Laws: As discussed in greater detail throughout these risk factors, we conduct business in a heavily regulated and closely scrutinized industry. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the payments for our RPM devices and further regulate the manner in which we interact with payors, providers, and patients. With respect to HGE, laws and regulations that govern providers\u2019 eligibility for reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for RPM services supported by HGE may have a significant effect on HGE\u2019s commercial success and may also pose a risk of liability for HGE if its provider customers submit claims for payment to federal healthcare programs in connection with HGE\u2019s services that do not meet applicable coverage and reimbursement requirements. In addition, HGE is subject to HIPAA by virtue of the services it provides as a business associate of health care provider customers that are HIPAA covered entities. While we make every effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, if we fail to do so, we could incur civil, criminal, or contractual penalties, be required to make significant changes to our operations, or experience adverse publicity. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Others\nExcept for in the United Kingdom, we rely on a network of third-party distributors to market and distribute our products internationally, and if we are unable to maintain and expand this network, we may be unable to generate anticipated sales.\nExcept for in the United Kingdom where we now have a direct sales organization after the acquisition of our former distributor, Solus Medical, on February 28, 2019, we rely on our network of third-party distributors to market and distribute our products internationally and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Internationally, we sell our products through a network of 47 independent distributors. Through these distributors, we sell our products in 51 countries outside of the United States, and we expect a significant amount of our revenue to come from international sales for the foreseeable future. In the past, we have experienced issues collecting payments from certain of our independent distributors and we may again experience such issues in the future. In the United States, a limited number of our customers purchase the disposable components of our Precision Flow systems through independent distributors who are able to better satisfy their just in time inventory requirements.\nWe face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the companies who make up that network. Broadly, if we fail to comply with export control laws or successfully\ndevelop our relationships with international distributors, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. We also cannot control the efforts and resources our third-party distributors will devote to marketing our products. Our distributors may be unable or unwilling to successfully market and sell our products and may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts that enable the products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance in their respective jurisdictions. Additionally, in some international jurisdictions, we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process, while complying with all applicable rules and regulations, and we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively. If we are unable to attract or retain additional international distributors, our international revenue may not grow.\nIf any of our international distributors were to cease to do business with us, our sales could be adversely affected. Some of our distributors have historically accounted for a material portion of our sales volume. If any such agency or distributor were to have its business operations impacted as a result of a third-party acquisition or cease to sell and market our products altogether, our sales could be adversely affected. In addition, if a dispute arises with a distributor or a distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business, it may take time to locate an alternative distributor or to begin selling directly into that market, to seek appropriate regulatory approvals or to train new personnel to market our products, and our ability to sell those systems in the region formerly serviced by such terminated distributor could be harmed. Any of our distributors could become insolvent or otherwise become unable to pay amounts owed to us when due. Any of these factors could reduce our revenue from affected markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation. If a distributor were to depart or be retained by one of our competitors and begin selling a competitive product, we may be unable to prevent them from helping competitors or themselves solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect our sales.\nIn any situation in which we lose the services of a distributor, we may need to seek alternative sales agencies or distributors, or to begin selling directly ourselves, and our sales may be adversely affected. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain additional qualified distributors to work with us. We may be unable to enter into agreements with them on a timely basis or on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified distributors would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales.\nAs a result of our reliance on third-party sales distributors, we may be subject to disruptions and increased costs due to factors beyond our control, including labor strikes, third-party error and other issues. If the services of any of these third-party distributors become unsatisfactory, we may experience delays in meeting our customers\u2019 product demands and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to deliver products in a timely manner may damage our reputation and could cause us to lose current or potential customers.\nWe obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our Precision Flow systems from single source suppliers and the partial or complete loss of one or more of these suppliers could cause significant production delays, an inability to meet customer demand and a substantial loss in revenue.\nWe utilize single source suppliers for some of the critical components and subassemblies we use in our Precision Flow systems. Disputes (including litigation) could arise with suppliers over a wide range of business and legal issues in our supply agreements, and there may be delays in switching to alternative suppliers if the current supply source expires or terminates. Our dependence on single source suppliers of components may expose us to several risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships as a result of unfavorable economic and market conditions unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, be subject to lengthy compliance, validation or qualification periods or make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in supplying of our products to our customers;\n\u2022\nnewly identified suppliers may not qualify under the stringent regulatory standards to which our business is subject;\n\u2022\nheightened risk of commercial disputes (including litigation) if we or our suppliers seek to negotiate changes to the terms of our supply agreements;\n\u2022\nwe or our suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we or our suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers;\n\u2022\nwe or our suppliers may lose access to critical manufacturing equipment, services, and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our systems and in higher cost to us;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may be subject to allegations by other parties of misappropriation of proprietary information in connection with their supply of products to us, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for products that our suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to effectively manage our relationships with our suppliers;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may increase the price of the components we purchase above the then-current market prices;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may wish to discontinue supplying components or services to us; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become unavailable for any reason, including manufacturing equipment failure.\nIn addition, we may be deemed to manufacture or contract to manufacture products that contain certain minerals that have been designated as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, we are required to diligence the origin of such minerals and disclose and report for the first time in 2021 whether or not such minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products.\nIf any of these risks materialize, costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted.\nIf we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our Precision Flow systems in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenue would be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and customers may instead purchase or use alternative products. In addition, we could be forced to secure new or alternative components and subassemblies through a replacement supplier. Finding alternative sources for these components and subassemblies could be difficult in certain cases and may entail a significant amount of time, disruption and increased cost. In some cases, we would need to change the components or subassemblies if we sourced them from an alternative supplier. This, in turn, could require a redesign of our Precision Flow systems or our Oxygen Assist Module, and, potentially, require additional FDA, or in the case of the Oxygen Assist Module, certain international clearance or approval before we could use any redesigned product with new components or subassemblies, thereby causing further costs and delays that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with all our third-party suppliers.\nWe purchase components and subassemblies from third-party suppliers, including some of our single source suppliers, through purchase orders and do not have long-term supply contracts with some of these third-party suppliers. These third-party suppliers, therefore, are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. For certain of these suppliers, we do not maintain large volumes of inventory. If we inaccurately forecast demand for components or subassemblies, our ability to manufacture and commercialize our Precision Flow systems could be delayed and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nWe often maintain high levels of inventory from our single source suppliers, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges.\nOur Precision Flow systems consist of a substantial number of components. In order to market or sell our Precision Flow systems effectively, we often must maintain high levels of inventory of the product and its components from our single source suppliers. The manufacturing process requires lengthy lead time during which components of our Precision Flow\nsystems may become obsolete, and we may over- or under-estimate the amount needed of a given component, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the amount of end product that we produce.\nSimilarly, in order to market or sell our Oxygen Assist Module effectively, we often must maintain high levels of finished goods inventory from a single source supplier. The manufacturing process requires lengthy lead times during which components of our Oxygen Assist module may become obsolete, and we may over- or under-estimate the number of finished goods required, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the amount of Oxygen Assist Modules that we procure.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our products on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our products to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of Precision Flow systems, or Oxygen Assist Modules, it would be costly to replace such systems in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our products and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to process orders for our products on a timely basis.\nThe loss of our senior management or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of the members of our executive management team, particularly Joseph Army, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any of these persons for any reason whatsoever, could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Also, each of these persons may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nAdditionally, our business and operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We may be unable to attract or retain qualified employees in the future for many reasons, including low regional, domestic, and international unemployment rates, the competition for qualified personnel among medical device businesses, or the cost of hiring qualified employees may exceed industry standards. Recruiting and retention difficulties could limit our ability to support our commercial, supply chain and research and development programs. Any of our employees may terminate his or her employment at any time and for any reason. The loss of key employees, the failure of any key employee to perform, our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, or an inability to effectively plan for and implement a succession plan for key employees could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.\nWe and our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere, including by the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and its foreign counterparts. The FDA regulates the design, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, non-clinical and clinical research, safety, efficacy, packaging, installation, servicing, marketing and distribution, premarket clearance or approval, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, recalls and field safety corrective actions, adverse event reporting, post-market approval studies, and product import and export to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and meet other applicable requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex. Additional regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA enforces these regulatory requirements through, among other methods of oversight, periodic unannounced inspections. We do not know whether we will pass any future FDA inspections. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters; fines; injunctions; civil penalties; termination of distribution; recalls or seizures of products; delays in the introduction of products into the market; total or partial\nsuspension of production; refusal to grant future clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nWe may not receive the necessary authorizations to market our future products, and failure to timely obtain such authorizations for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nAn element of our business strategy is to continue to develop new products and add new features and expand clearance or approval of our current products to new indications. In the United States, in general, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to a legally marketed device, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or the grant of a de novo request under section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA or a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics, not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device and be as safe and as effective as the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support a substantial equivalence determination. In the de novo process, a manufacturer whose novel device under the FDCA would otherwise be automatically classified as Class III and require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing is able to request down-classification of the device to Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents a low or moderate risk. If the FDA grants the de novo petition, the applicant will receive authorization to market the device. This device type may be used subsequently as a predicate device for 510(k) submissions. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.\nThe PMA approval, the 510(k) clearance and the de novo processes can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance and de novo processes can take from three to 12 months but may last significantly longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Clinical data may also be required in connection with an application for 510(k) clearance or a de novo request. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved, reclassified or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indications for use or intended uses of the device, which may limit the market for the device.\nIn the United States, we obtained 510(k) premarket clearances from the FDA to market each of our products requiring such clearance. We also obtained a de novo grant for an expanded indication for our Precision Flow Hi-VNI system. Any modifications to these existing products may require new 510(k) clearance; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain de novo process or PMA process. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous premarket review process for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, such as with our Oxygen Assist Module, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny 510(k) clearance, request for de novo classification, or pre-market approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that the products or modifications are substantially equivalent to a proposed predicate device or safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022\nFDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with the design, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials or the analyses or interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nparticipants in our clinical trials may experience serious adverse effects;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance, de novo classification, or approval, where required;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks;\n\u2022\nan advisory committee, if convened by the applicable regulatory authority, may recommend against authorization for marketing or may recommend that the applicable regulatory authority require, as a condition of marketing authorization, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on labeling or distribution and use restrictions, or even if an advisory committee, if convened, makes a favorable recommendation, the respective regulatory authority may still not authorize the product for marketing;\n\u2022\nthe applicable regulatory authority may identify deficiencies in our submissions or in the facilities or processes of our third-party contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies may change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance, de novo classification, or approval; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may audit our clinical trial data and conclude that the data is not sufficiently reliable to support a submission for marketing authorization.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, or Congress may enact different or additional statutory requirements, which may prevent or delay approval, de novo classification, or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently marketed products on a timely basis. Such policy, statutory or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or PMA approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current marketing authorizations.\nIn order to sell our products in member countries of the European Economic Area (the 27 member states of the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or the EEA, our products must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC), or the MDD. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the MDD, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. If we fail to remain in compliance with applicable European laws and directives, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE Mark to our devices, which would prevent us from selling them within the EEA.\nOn May 26, 2020 the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council), or the MDR, replaced the EU MDD in the European Economic Area. In regard to the UK, because the MDR was codified into UK law at the time of Brexit, the same MDR requirements will apply to our commercial activity in the UK, at least during the post-Brexit transition period.\nThe new MDR imposes more strict requirements on medical device manufacturers and the Notified Bodies whom they must involve in the conformity assessment procedure (other than self-declaration Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices and (new) non-reusable surgical instruments). The MDR adds new requirements, such as a reclassification of certain devices, a Unique Device Identification (UDI) system, a wider scope of the Quality Management System including clinical evaluation and post-marketing clinical follow-up, a clinical evaluation procedure for some Class IIb and Class III devices by an\nindependent expert panel, among others. New medical devices introduced after May 26, 2020 must comply with the MDR rules. That means we will need to undergo the applicable conformity assessment procedure according to MDR, through representation by a Notified Body, for all new devices we introduce after that date. The new devices will have to be CE marked pursuant to MDR.\nTo avoid market disruption and allow a smooth transition from the EU MDD to the EU MDR several transitional provisions are in place (although the transitional processes and the status of the MDR in the UK are uncertain after the post-Brexit transition through the end of 2020 or afterward if extended). Although from May 26, 2021, all new certificates will have to be delivered according to MDR, devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the MDD prior to May 26, 2021 may continue to be made available until May 26, 2025.\nThe sale and marketing of imported medical device products in China are subject to notifications (for Class I devices) or registrations (for Class II and III devices) with the NMPA. The Center for Medical Device Evaluation (\u201cCMDE\u201d) of the NMPA will need to conduct technical review of product safety and effectiveness with respect to imported Class 2 and Class 3 devices. The statutory time limit for such technical review is 60 working days for Class 2 devices and 90 working days for Class 3 devices. Additional time can be required for the response to the CMDE\u2019s deficiency notices and the GMP compliance inspections conducted by the Center for Food and Drug Institute (\u201cCFDI\u201d) of the NMPA. Furthermore, manufacturers are likely to be required to conduct local clinical trials in China if their devices are not on the NMPA Clinical Trial Exemption List, are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device on the market, or do not have any overseas clinical study data or real world evidence to prove safety and effectiveness in Chinese patient population. Additionally, pre-submission in-country type testing by the NMPA-designated testing centers can further prolong the approval process, especially when applicable Chinese device standards are not harmonized with corresponding international standards. The whole process for obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals in China can be lengthy and expensive, and the results are unpredictable. In addition, uncertain regulatory or political environment changes and healthcare system reforms in China may result in the delay of certain regulatory clearance or approval for some of our products.\nWe or our distributors will also need to obtain regulatory approval in other foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to market and sell our products. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations, clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. If we modify our products, we or our distributors may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals before we are permitted to sell the modified product. In addition, we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we or our distributors have received. If we or our distributors are unable to maintain our authorizations in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell the applicable product in that country.\nMarketing authorization by the FDA does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and clearance or approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval or other marketing authorization in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nCertain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearance or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.\nOnce a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or a PMA, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device. Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or approval of a PMA or PMA amendments or supplements. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, requests for de novo classification, or PMAs (or PMA supplements or amendments) for modifications to our previously cleared or reclassified products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nOur products have been cleared by the FDA for specific indications. The FDA and European regulatory authorities strictly regulate the indications for use and associated promotional safety and effectiveness claims, including comparative and superiority claims vis a vis competitors\u2019 products, that may be made about legally marketed products. In particular, a medical device may not be promoted in a way that constitutes adulteration or misbranding under the FDCA. We train our marketing personnel and sales representatives and distributors to promote our products consistent with applicable laws and published clinical data. However, a physician, in his or her medical judgment, can prescribe a course of treatment that is outside the product\u2019s labeling. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products in this manner. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those authorized by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials, sales practices or training constitute improper promotion of an off-label use, including as a result of their disagreement with our interpretation of published clinical data or the FDA\u2019s recent grant of our de novo request and corresponding expanded indications for use, they could request that we modify our training, sales practices or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations. Additionally, the FDA might fail to take action against competitors whose promotional materials, sales practices or training mirror our own but who have not yet achieved the expanded indications for use we received in connection with the FDA\u2019s recent grant of our de novo request. These types of enforcement actions, or enforcement omissions, could have a material adverse impact on our business, product sales and financial results.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, expeditiously and effectively evaluate product complaints and promotional matters, or otherwise prevent new or modified products and indications from being developed, cleared or approved, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to hire, retain, or deploy key leadership and other personnel, expeditiously and effectively evaluate product complaints and promotional matters, or otherwise review and clear or approve new or modified products and indications can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, a dramatic increase in Emergency Use Authorizations or other regulatory submissions, a dramatic increase in the issuance of guidance documents, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may impede the FDA\u2019s ability to expeditiously evaluate product complaints and promotional matters, and may also slow the time necessary for new medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved medical devices or indications to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business.\nFor example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. As another example, following the FDA\u2019s issuance of certain Emergency Use Authorization communications in March 2020 that identified the product code that includes our Precision Flow Hi-VNI system, QAV, on a list of ventilators and/or ventilatory support devices, we prepared a letter-to-file to modify the indications for use of the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system. We believe these modifications are consistent with the FDA\u2019s recent communication and our clinical data. However, to the extent we market the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system using the modified labeling, the possibility exists that the FDA may not agree with the decision that a new clearance or approval was unnecessary for this label revision for any number of reasons, including, without limitation, that we used an inappropriate intended use statement, and as a result may require us to submit a new 510(k) notification, request for de novo classification, premarket approval (PMA) (or PMA supplements or amendments) or subject us to other consequences. In addition, on April 29, 2020 the FDA reached out with an informal inquiry regarding our marketing of the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system. We responded to\nthat inquiry in a timely manner, but the FDA may ultimately determine that our website or other promotional materials, sales practices, or training constitute the improper promotion of a medical device.\nAdditionally, in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020, and subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our marketing applications, clinical trial authorizations, emergency use applications, or other regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products must be manufactured in accordance with federal, state and international regulations, and we could be forced to recall our installed devices or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedure and documentation of, among other requirements, the design, testing, validation, verification, complaint handling, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, supplier evaluation, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical devices. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through, among other oversight methods, periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of subcontractors, suppliers, or contract manufacturing organizations. Our products are also subject to similar state regulations and various laws and regulations of foreign countries governing manufacturing. For example, certain of our electrical components in our products are audited pursuant to International Electrotechnical Transmission standard 60601, a widely accepted benchmark for medical electrical equipment compliance that has become a requirement for the commercialization of electrical medical equipment in many countries. We are routinely audited under this standard and negative findings from an audit could prevent us from marketing our products in certain countries.\nOur third-party manufacturers may not take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations or our specifications, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products. In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; fines, injunctions or civil penalties; suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances; seizures or recalls of our products; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; administrative or judicially imposed sanctions; the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our products; clinical holds; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and criminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nAny of these actions could significantly and negatively impact supply of our products. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and suffer reduced revenue and increased costs.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA and other governmental authorities, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we do business. We will be required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations, or MDRs, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur to the device or a similar device that we market, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or other governmental authorities\ncould take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in clearance of future products.\nThe FDA and certain foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products under certain circumstances. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death.\nA government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. We have in the past conducted voluntary recalls of devices with lot-specific quality issues. For example, in September 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of various lots of the disposable patient circuit due to the device allowing water to leak into the center gas lumen. This recall was terminated in October 2015. Additionally, we received a small number of complaints involving a defect in the disposable patient circuit that allowed water to leak where the delivery tube is connected to the disposable water path. In response, we initiated a voluntary recall of the four affected lots that began on May 4, 2016 and terminated on August 17, 2016. Product defects or other errors resulting in recalls may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA or other governmental bodies may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new marketing authorizations for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such marketing authorizations may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal proceedings.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, removals and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals, removals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, including product recall, will require the dedication of our time and capital and could harm our reputation and financial results.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of medical devices and spur innovation. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. The Biden Administration may enact certain policies that may impact our business and industry. It is difficult to predict how potential executive actions affect the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If potential executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nCertain of our customers are highly dependent on payments from third-party payors, including government sponsored programs, in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and reductions in third-party coverage and reimbursement rates for our products (or services provided with our products) could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenue depends, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products purchased by our customers are reimbursed by third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, other U.S. government sponsored programs, non-U.S. governmental payors and private payors. Our customers\u2019 ability to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for products and services from these third-party payors affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Many of our products are used in services that are often reimbursed by third-party payors as part of a global payment that covers all costs associated with providing that service. This means that healthcare providers incur costs purchasing these products but do not receive separate or additional reimbursement in connection with their use. As a result, certain healthcare providers may be reluctant to adopt our products. Similarly, our customers may not adopt our products if they are more costly than competitor products, including products used to provide alternative treatments. If we\nlower the prices for our products to obtain or maintain customers\u2019 business, we may be adversely affected financially. Similarly, our customers\u2019 ability to obtain appropriate productivity credit from their applicable internal administrations affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.\nFor some of our products, such as HGE\u2019s remote physiologic monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) products, our customers may receive additional reimbursement associated with those products. To the extent that third-party payors modify or eliminate coverage for the RPM products or reduce their reimbursement to our customers for their use of those products, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform and other legislative action.\nThere have been and continue to be laws enacted by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes included the creation of demonstration programs and other value-based purchasing initiatives that provide financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to reduce costs.\nUnder the Trump Administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017 includes provisions that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d). The Healthcare Reform Act also has been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. On appeal, a federal appeals court held in December 2019 that the individual mandate portion of the Healthcare Reform Act was unconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act would be valid without the individual mandate. On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this case, but it is unknown when the Supreme Court will issue a decision. We expect healthcare reform efforts to continue throughout the Biden administration and that there will be additional reform proposals at federal and state levels. We cannot predict whether additional reform proposals will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us, but any such proposals could have a negative impact on our business and provide incentives for hospitals and physicians to not use our products and services.\nGeneral legislative action also may affect our business. The Budget Control Act of 2011 includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry, group purchasing organizations or integrated distributor networks could lead to demands for price concessions, which may affect our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payors. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create more requests for pricing concessions in the future. Failure to meet these concessions may result in our exclusion from these contracts. Additionally, group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts may continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals by limiting the number of products available under various purchasing categories. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry world-wide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nAs the healthcare system consolidates the number of health systems and group purchasing organizations controlling the buying process has also constricted. In order to sell to hospitals that belong to these organizations we must be on contract. Not being on contract with these organizations, or choices of these organizations to standardize on a competitive product option or otherwise decline to renew our contract, or the failure of these organizations to differentiate our new Precision Flow Hi-VNI system, which we fully launched in 2019 and is our first product to have the de novo expanded indication for use statement, from conventional heated humidified high flow oxygen devices could substantially reduce our revenue opportunity.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we market our products may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation will fully apply on May 26, 2021. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:\n\u2022\nstrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022\nestablish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022\nimprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022\nset up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and\n\u2022\nstrengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThese modifications may have an effect on the way we conduct our business in the EEA.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws and state licensure or permit laws which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws. Our business practices and interactions with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. The significant U.S. healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for\npayment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose substantial penalties plus three times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the submission of a false claim, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act or Open Payments which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under certain federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to report annually to the DHHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals and physicians, which term is defined broadly to include practitioners such as podiatrists and dentists, (and, beginning with transfers of value in 2021, to additional non-physician practitioners) as well as to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS and failure to submit required information may result in substantial civil monetary penalties, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe HIPPA fraud and abuse provisions, which may impose criminal penalties for defrauding any healthcare benefit program, including public and private payors, or making any false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and\n\u2022\nstate laws that require medical device companies to obtain wholesale distribution or pharmacy permits and other state licensing laws.\nMore generally, these laws and regulations constrain our promotional and other business activities by limiting the kinds of financial interactions, including discount and other commercial transactions, we may have with individuals or entities that use, order, purchase or recommend our products such as patients and healthcare providers. We have a variety of arrangements with our customers that could implicate these laws and regulations. For example, like many medical device companies that have related capital and consumable products, we periodically permit customers that purchase the disposable component of our Precision Flow systems to use the capital component at no upfront cost as part of a bundled discount sale. A small percentage of our company is owned by healthcare professionals, and we also have also entered into consulting agreements with physicians, including some who influence the ordering of or use our products in procedures they perform. To facilitate product discussions, we also provide meals to healthcare practitioners who might use or order services using our products. We arrange for continuing education programs for healthcare practitioners to provide education about our products and the conditions our products are approved to treat. As another example, with federal RPM coverage requirements evolving, our customers may submit claims to federal payors for services furnished in connection with our RPM support services, which could result in some services not eligible for reimbursement being nonetheless billed to Medicare or Medicaid and therefore triggering False Claims Act liability. We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies determine our financial interactions to be in violation of applicable laws. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of exceptions and/or safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which the laws are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare companies or healthcare providers may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur international operations subject us to certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our international commercial efforts in the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Japan and other international markets. Economic or political instability in any of these markets could have a significant impact on our operations. Additionally, the sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components from international sources, subjects us to U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and customs regulations and laws.\nCompliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as sanctions and export controls laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting.\nOur international operations expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and in defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us, our distributors or any of our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality salespeople, clinical educators and distributors;\n\u2022\nthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\ncompetitive disadvantage to competition with established business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny by foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.\nBecause we plan to continue using foreign contract manufacturers, our operating results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other factors in foreign countries.\nWe currently use foreign contract manufacturers and plan to continue to use foreign contract manufacturers to manufacture current and future products, where appropriate. These international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may adversely affect us, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of inflation, historically the case in a number of countries in Asia;\n\u2022\nburdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws, regulations and sanctions;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes and duties;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariff rates or other trade, tax or monetary policies; and\n\u2022\nchanges or volatility in current exchange rates and interest rates.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe contract with several Chinese suppliers for certain components of our Precision Flow systems. If significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. Recently, political discourse in the United States has increasingly focused on ways to discourage U.S. competitors from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign corporations and curb what are considered unfair trade practices. In January 2020, the United States and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the \u201cPhase One Trade Agreement\u201d). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the United States and China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement is an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the United States and China. However, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, through October 2020 China has only purchased 56% of its year-to-date purchase commitment under the Phase One Trade Agreement. No further agreements have been reached and the impact of the Phase One Trade Agreement and any forthcoming trade deal cannot be determined at this time. If tariffs are imposed on the components used in our Precision Flow systems, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations.\nEfforts to withdraw from or materially modify the USMCA or other international trade agreements, to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs, economic sanctions or related legislation, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce, as we develop, market and sell our products and services globally.\nAny modification in these areas, any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations and could result in increased costs. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from membership in the European Union could adversely affect our financial results and our operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union.\nThe United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020, which is commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. A transition period through December 31, 2020 was established to allow the United Kingdom and European Union to negotiate the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal. However, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including trade agreements between the United Kingdom\nand the European Union. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which (if any) European Union laws to replace or replicate, including determining whether to adopt the European Union law that governs the regulatory approval of medical devices such as the Precision Flow systems or related future product offerings we may seek to bring to market in the United Kingdom. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose customers and employees or increase the cost of doing business in the United Kingdom. In addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the European Union. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the absence of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have and how such withdrawal will affect our Company, including our United Kingdom subsidiary Solus Medical, and the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. Volatility in stock or currency markets, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies each could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have international operations, including a direct sales organization in the United Kingdom, and, as a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our selling price or risk making our products less competitive in international markets, or our costs could increase. Also, if our international sales increase, we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollars, which could expose us to increased foreign currency risks, including currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. For example, following the acquisition of our former distributor, Solus Medical, on February 28, 2019, we began invoicing our United Kingdom customers directly in Great British Pounds. We do not currently engage in any hedging transactions. If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful, and our business could be harmed.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to secure and maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for our products, we may lose a significant competitive advantage.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on obtaining, maintaining and defending patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies used in our products. The patent positions of medical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations or products and may choose not to pursue patent protection for certain products in certain jurisdictions or at all, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope and, in any event, any patent protection we obtain may be limited. As a result, some of our products are not, and in the future may not be, protected by patents. This may mean we may be unable to:\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from duplicating our products;\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology; or\n\u2022\ngain or maintain a competitive advantage.\nWe intend to seek additional patents, but our pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. In addition, issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinctive patent laws. We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. Patent prosecution, related proceedings, and litigation in the U.S. and in other countries may be expensive, time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. In addition, patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under U.S. patent law and may not adequately protect our proprietary information. Our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours or design around our patents. The technologies we have patented, licensed or developed. Moreover, the expiration of patents on which we rely for protection of key products could diminish our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and our prospects. Consequently, competitors could develop, manufacture and sell products that directly compete with our products, which could decrease our sales and diminish our ability to compete.\nEven if our patents are determined by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, foreign patent office, or a court to be valid and enforceable, they may not be drafted or interpreted sufficiently broadly enough in scope to prevent others from marketing products and services similar to ours or designing around our patents. For example, third parties may be able to develop therapies, or make systems or devices, that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of our patents. Third parties may assert that we or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications. The claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our commercial technology or the future products and services that we develop. We may not have freedom to operate unimpeded by the patent rights of others. Third parties may have dominating, blocking or other patents relevant to our technology of which we are not aware. Because an originally filed patent application can be refiled to obtain continuation patents with new claims based on the priority date of the original application, we cannot be certain that our competitors will not file and obtain new continuation patents in an attempt to cover our commercial technology notwithstanding it having been available in the market for over 10 years. In addition, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the filing of certain priority documents (or, in some cases, are not published until they issue as patents) and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for our technology or our next generation contemplated technology. Any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications or issued patents, which could further require us to obtain rights from third parties to issued patents or pending patent applications covering such technologies to allow us to commercialize our technology. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, depending on when the timing of the filing date falls under certain patent laws, we may have to participate in a priority contest (such as an interference proceeding) declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. There may be prior public disclosures of which we are not aware that could invalidate our patents or one or more claims of our patents. Further, we may not develop additional proprietary technologies and, even if we do, they may not be patentable.\nMoreover, in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, proceedings to enforce our patent rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us, or they may assert such claims on their own. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful, or we may be required to pay damages and legal fees of our adversaries. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to patent and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented manufacturing know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our consultants and vendors, or our former or current employees. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, however, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information, and once disclosed, we are likely to lose trade secret protection. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to enforce trade secret protection.\nFurther, our competitors may independently acquire or develop know-how or other technology that is similar, equivalent, or superior to our proprietary technology. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology, or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. In addition, our key employees, consultants, suppliers or other individuals with access to our proprietary technology may incorporate that technology into projects and inventions developed independently or with third parties. As a result, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of the proprietary rights to such technology, and any such dispute may not be resolved in our favor. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology to compete with us and our competitive position could be adversely affected. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties have registered trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions and may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we were not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may in the future become involved in lawsuits to defend ourselves against intellectual property disputes, which could be expensive and time consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, and hinder our ability to commercialize our existing or future products.\nOur success depends in part on not infringing the patents or violating other proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property disputes can be very costly to defend or affirmatively pursue, distract leadership, require financing, and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs frequently in the medical device industry, and we intend to engage as necessary to defend our rights. Whether merited or not, it is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products. We may also face allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property rights of their former employers or other third parties. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit, or otherwise interfere with our ability to commercialize our products. These competitors may have one or more patents for which they can threaten and/or initiate patent infringement actions against us, and we may have one or more patents for which we can threaten and/or initiate patent infringement actions against them. Our ability to defend ourselves or to affirmatively pursue such actions may be limited by our financial and human resources, the availability of reasonable defenses and claims, and the ultimate acceptance of our defenses and claims by the courts or juries. Further, if such patents are successfully asserted against us, this may result in an adverse impact on our business, including injunctions, damages, and/or attorneys\u2019 fees. From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we may develop noninfringement and/or invalidity positions with respect to third-party patents, which may or may not be ultimately adjudicated as successful by a judge or jury if such patents were asserted against us.\nWe have and may receive in the future, particularly as a public company, communications from patent holders, including non-practicing entities, alleging infringement of patents, infringement of other intellectual property rights including misappropriation of trade secrets, offering licenses to such intellectual property, or challenging our intellectual property. For example in 2018 Stamford Devices Limited opposed our European patent-EP2806926 before the parties reached a settlement in 2019. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.\nThe large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks and the costs related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop selling, making, using, or exporting products that use the disputed intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, exporting, or using products, which license may require substantial payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing, potentially including treble damages if the court finds that the infringement was willful;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third-party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and services;\n\u2022\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nfind non-infringing substitute products, which could be costly and create significant delay due to the need for FDA regulatory clearance;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to opportunity to successfully protect our intellectual property and assert it against others;\n\u2022\nfind alternative supplies for infringing products or processes, which could be costly and create significant delay due to the need for FDA regulatory clearance; or\n\u2022\nredesign those products or processes that infringe any third-party intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive, and/or infeasible.\nFrom time to time, we may affirmatively engage in or be subjected to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Finally, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers, suppliers and international distributors against claims relating to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties relating to our products, methods, and/or manufacturing processes. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers, suppliers, or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, suppliers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers, or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products, or our suppliers may be forced to stop providing us with products.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other contested proceedings, such as re-examination, inter parties review, or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party or could cause us to lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable\nterms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe are subject to various laws protecting the confidentiality and security of certain personal information, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations protecting the confidentiality and security of certain patient health information, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWithin the United States, numerous federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA, state data privacy laws (for example, the CPPA), state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. Compliance with HIPAA and state data privacy law equivalents is particularly relevant for HGE. HGE is a business associate of its HIPAA covered entity customers by virtue of receiving individually identifiable health information (referred to as \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d) from these customers. In its business associate relationships, HGE must comply with applicable HIPAA requirements, state data privacy and security requirements, and the contractual terms of our business associate agreements that govern its permitted uses and disclosures of PHI received from the covered entity counterparty.\nOutside the United States, numerous countries in which we operate, manufacture and sell our products have, or are developing, laws protecting data privacy and the confidentiality of certain personal data. For example, the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, introduced new data protection requirements in the EEA, and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules. The GDPR expanded significantly the jurisdictional reach of EEA data protection law by extending the law\u2019s application to not only entities that are established in the EEA, but also to entities that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects located in the EEA or process personal data in connection with monitoring the behavior of data subjects located in the EEA. The GDPR imposes strict obligations and restrictions on controllers and processors of personal data including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (e.g., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, appointment of a data protection officer when sensitive personal data (e.g., health data) are processed on a large scale, requirement to enter into certain types of contracts with service providers processing personal data, implementation of appropriate privacy governance measures, and expanded rights for individuals over their personal data. This could affect our ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting, or could cause our costs to increase, potentially leading to harm to our business and financial condition.\nWhile the GDPR, as a directly effective regulation, was designed to harmonize data protection laws across the EEA, it does permit member states to legislate in many areas (particularly with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data), meaning that inconsistencies between different member states will still arise. EEA member states have their own regimes on medical confidentiality and national and EEA-level guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States, which may deviate from the GDPR, may result in substantial fines, and in addition to such fines, we may be the subject of litigation initiated by data subjects and/or adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we are required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, may make it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, will require the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (e.g., health data or data concerning race or ethnicity) is processed on a large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements throughout the EEA, imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with service providers and requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, and training.\nEuropean data protection law generally prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, unless there are specific frameworks or mechanisms in place to safeguard the data, such as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, or very narrow legal exceptions (such as explicit consent of the data subject) apply. There is currently litigation challenging the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the standard contractual clauses, and it is uncertain whether these data transfer mechanisms will be invalidated by the European courts. We could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by European regulators under the GDPR, as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts.\nOutside of the EEA, the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues that may affect our business. There is a degree of uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies, such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. A determination that we have violated privacy or data protection laws could result in significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include, among other things, provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, establish specific venues and procedures for litigating patent validity, and switched the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. The Leahy-Smith Act and its interpretation and implementation are still evolving and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and may continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and may continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our own, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan, and the protection any patent affords is limited. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. For any patents we have that cover our products (or new patents we obtain), once the patent life has expired we may be open to competition from competitive devices and services. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing devices or services that compete with ours.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nCurrently, our intellectual property portfolio includes numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our platform technology. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have no have patent protection or our protection is insufficient to terminate infringing activities.\nWe may not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. Although we have procedures in place that seek to prevent our employees and consultants from using the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or competitor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and may prevent us from selling our products or from practicing our processes. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Need for Additional Capital\nOur substantial indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had $40.0 million of aggregate principal amount of term loans and $4.9 million of aggregate amount or revolving loans outstanding under our Loan and Security Agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d).\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences to our debt holders and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates, and we may not be able to enter into interest rate swaps and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from capitalizing on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, our indebtedness under the Loan and Security Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, and the Loan and Security Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Loan and Security Agreement limits our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness. In addition, the Loan and Security Agreement does not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risk associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our potential inability to service our debt, will increase.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Loan and Security Agreement, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Loan and Security Agreement and our other indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with our Loan and Security Agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under our Loan and Security Agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default.\nFurther, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.\nAs a result, any default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement restricts our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement provides that all indebtedness thereunder is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, and imposes significant operating and financial restrictions and limits our ability and our other subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nenter into any new line of business not reasonably related to our existing business;\n\u2022\npay, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year or make any significant changes in accounting treatment or reporting practices;\n\u2022\namend, modify or terminate material agreements and organizational documents;\n\u2022\nenter into certain inbound and outbound licenses; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, our Loan and Securities Agreement requires us to comply with a minimum liquidity covenant at all times and a minimum revenue covenant measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Loan and Security Agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing commercial operations, develop and commercialize new products and expand our operations.\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our current cash, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash receipts from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If our available cash balances, borrowing capacity, cash receipts and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower demand for our products as a result of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may, among other things, seek to sell common or preferred equity, convertible debt securities, or enter into new or amend existing credit facilities.\nAdditionally, we may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to:\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to increase market adoption of our products and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nprovide for supply and inventory costs associated with plans to accommodate potential increases in demand for our products;\n\u2022\nfund development and marketing efforts of any future products or additional features to then-current products;\n\u2022\nacquire, license or invest in new technologies;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and sustain revenue growth and improve gross margins;\n\u2022\nthe cost of expanding our operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts related to international expansion; and\n\u2022\nthe potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products.\nAdditional capital may not be available at such times or in amounts as needed by us. Even if capital is available, it might be available only on unfavorable terms. Any additional equity or convertible debt financing into which we enter could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any future debt financing into which we enter will be senior in bankruptcy to our common stock and may impose covenants upon us that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If access to sufficient capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail one or more product development or commercialization programs, or we may be required to significantly reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all our assets.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During 2020, the sales price of our common stock ranged from $6.86 to $54.42. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncommercial success and market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nsuccess of our competitors in developing or commercializing products;\n\u2022\nability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approvals for our products, or delays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nstrategic transactions undertaken by us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndisputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nhealthcare reform measures in the United States;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n\u2022\ninternational trade disputes;\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic instability, including wars with foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic political and economic instability;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions caused by earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters; and\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations regarding us.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced extreme volatility that has been often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be attributed to being a newly public company and could result in time consuming and costly regulatory inquiries. These broad market and industry fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. For these reasons, we believe comparisons of our financial results from various reporting periods are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nTo comply with the requirements imposed on us as a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, insurance, accounting and other expenses. We have invested and intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from product development activities. These laws, regulations and standards are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, enforcement proceedings and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governing practices. The costs associated with maintaining directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance has risen and may continue to rise in the future, which may require us to accept reduced coverage, increased deductibles or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. We also expect the rules and regulations associated with being a public company to make it more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of our periodic management evaluations or our ability to obtain attestation reports from our independent registered public accounting\nfirm. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, our common stock may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we no longer qualified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies no longer apply to us. As a result, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those additional requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements for internal controls. Compliance with these additional laws, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. In addition, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may also need to hire more employees in the future or engage additional outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which would increase our costs and expenses.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has not been required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the past, and now that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and stockholders who owned more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 59.14% of our common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants that are exercisable within 60 days after such date. Accordingly, these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management or board of directors, delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We have also registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nMoreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If such holders, by exercising their registration rights, cause a large number of securities to be registered and sold into the public market, these sales could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; therefore, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to finance the growth and\ndevelopment of our business. In addition, our Loan Agreement contains and the terms of any future credit agreements we enter into may contain, terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. As a recently public company, we may be slow to attract securities and industry analysts coverage. If no or a limited number of securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022\nexpressly authorized our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a\npremium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates exclusive forums for various actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the state or federal courts within the State of Delaware will be exclusive forums for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, is not enforceable. However, this decision may be reviewed and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur operations, and those of our suppliers and customers, are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes and other events beyond our control.\nOur principal executive office, U.S. distribution, and manufacturing operations are located in a leased facility located in Exeter, New Hampshire. We also have access to facilities for Solus personnel and HGE\u2019s personnel as well as facilities for inventory and a manufacturing and distribution site in Tilburg, Netherlands. These facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. A disaster (such as an earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, a volcanic eruption other severe weather, or a pandemic or other outbreak) affecting our facilities, or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations, and delay or prevent product shipment or installation during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace the damaged facilities.\nEven if we are able to quickly respond to a disaster, the ongoing effects of the disaster could create some uncertainty in the operations of our business. Our customers\u2019 facilities could also be negatively impacted by a disaster, which could delay shipments of our products. Additionally, customers may delay purchases of our products until their operations return to normal.\nIn addition, our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil or an outbreak of epidemic diseases could have a negative effect on our operations, those of our suppliers and customers.\nIf we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including customer management, accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. We do not have redundant systems at this time. While we will attempt to mitigate interruptions, we may experience difficulties in implementing system upgrades, or experience difficulties in operating our business during the upgrade, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the current implementation of our information technology systems, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Currently we carry business interruption coverage to mitigate any potential losses, but we cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed our policy limits.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our infrastructure, particularly with respect to HGE. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems. While we implemented security measures relating to our operations, consistent with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health \u201cHITECH\u201d) Act and their implementing regulations (collectively \u201cHIPAA\u201d), those measures may not always prevent security breaches that could harm our business. Advances in computer capabilities, inadequate technology or facility security measures or other factors may result in a compromise or breach of our systems and the data we store and process. Our security measures may be breached as a result of actions by third parties or employee error or malfeasance. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures or exploit inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other things, misappropriate proprietary information, including information about third parties, cause the loss or disclosure of some or all of this information, cause interruptions in our operations or expose third parties to computer viruses or other disruptions or vulnerabilities. Any compromise of our systems or the data we store or process could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our software, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, a compromise of our systems could remain undetected for an extended period of time, exacerbating the impact of that compromise. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers, or other third parties, including the federal and state governments. While our business agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our liability, there is no assurance these provisions will be enforceable and effective under applicable law. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nWe have in the past and we, as well as certain of our officers and distributors, may in the future be subject to various litigation or other claims or lawsuits. The outcomes of legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants may seek damages. Future claimants including suppliers, customers, distributors, competitors, officers or shareholders, among others, may also seek other civil or criminal remedies (including royalties or injunctions barring the sale of products that are subject of the proceeding) in the future. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses, could divert management\u2019s time and other resources and could cause us reputational harm. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines.\nEmployment litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.\nEmployees may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, creating a hostile workplace, discrimination, wage and hour, sexual harassment and other employment issues. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Companies that have faced employment or harassment related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their sales. If we were to face any employment related claims, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, foreign liability, employee benefits liability, property, umbrella, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if these policies will provide us with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18247, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "VAPO"}
