RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is subject to various risks, the most significant of which are summarized below.\n1. Reduced Reimbursement Rates. Most of our revenues are derived from our scanning center business conducted by HMCA. We are experiencing lower reimbursement rates from Medicare, other government programs and private insurance companies. To date, we have been able to counter the impact of these reductions by increasing our volume of scans and reducing our operating expenses, thereby maintaining profitability in this business segment. There is, however, no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so.\n2. Demand for MRI Scanners. The reduced reimbursement rates also affects our sales of MRI scanners negatively. With lower revenue projections, prospective customers would demand lower prices for scanners. Although the reduced reimbursements may not affect foreign demand, a lower number of sales in the aggregate could reduce economies of scale and consequently, profit margins.\n3.\nManufacturing Competition. Many if not most of our competing scanner manufacturers have significantly greater financial resources, production capacity, and other resources than we do. Such competitors would include General Electric, Siemens, Hitachi and Phillips. Although Fonar is the only company which can manufacture and sell the unique Stand-Up\u00ae (Upright\u00ae) MRI scanner, potential customers must be convinced that the purchase of a Fonar scanner is their best choice. We believe that with time, that objective will be reached, particularly with customers scanning patients having neck, back, knee and various orthopedic issues who would benefit from being scanned in weight-bearing positions.\n4. Dependence on Referrals. HMCA derives substantially all of its revenue, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at the facilities. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties to the facilities we manage or own for the services we perform. If these physicians and other third parties were to reduce the number of patients they refer or discontinue referring patients, scan volumes could decrease, which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins.\n5. Pressure to Control Healthcare Costs. One of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations is to control the cost of healthcare services. Healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to refer diagnostic imaging tests to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patient is enrolled. In addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive. The expansion of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within New York or Florida could have a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of services performed at the facilities HMCA manages or owns to the extent these organizations exert control over patients\u2019 access to diagnostic imaging services, selections of the provider of such services and reimbursement rates for those services.\n6. Scanning Facility Competition. The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. The facilities we manage or own compete for patients on the basis of reputation, location and the quality of diagnostic imaging services. Groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment are the principal competitors.\nFONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n7. Eligibility Changes to Insurance Programs. Due to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. Healthcare reform legislation will increase the participation of individuals in the Medicaid program in states that elect to participate in the expanded Medicaid coverage. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors or an increase in the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of reimbursement or an increase in uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in net revenue. Policies now being offered under various insurance plans are expected to reduce demand for MRI scans as they become less affordable. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs such as the Medicaid program and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible receivables. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n8, Proposed Reduction of New York Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits. A proposal was published by the New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (\u201cNYSWCB\u201d) in 2014 to change the fee schedule for Workers\u2019 Compensation payments. Initially, the fees proposed would be set at approximately 130% of the Medicare fees. This would reduce fees for the most commonly billed radiology procedures by approximately 60%. Further, since the Workers\u2019 Compensation fees are coupled with the New York State No Fault Program, radiology providers would suffer similar reductions for No-Fault fees. We and the HMCA clients wrote to the NYSWCB to argue against this proposal, and other affected parties commented as well. Since then, no further action has been taken by the NYSWCB to advance the 2014 proposal. On the contrary, the NYSWCB has adopted fee increases. There can be no assurance, however, that the NYSWCB will not modify their present position, or if they elect to do so, the extent to which the NYSWCB would do so. A significant reduction in Workers\u2019 Compensation and No-Fault fees could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n9. Possible changes in Florida Insurance Law. In early 2019, two senate bills and one house bill in Florida were introduced, all of them calling for the repeal of PIP and replacing PIP with $25,000 Bodily Injury Coverage and Property Damage Liability Coverage. Another Florida senate bill was introduced that would preserve PIP but dramatically cut reimbursement rates. None of the proposed bills ever made it onto the 2019 legislative agenda, but similar efforts in the future might be successful. Currently, drivers and passengers get car damages and PIP, paid for up to $10,000, no matter who is at fault in an accident. Drivers have to pay an additional cost to insurance companies to pay for bodily injuries, which covers them if they are at fault. While PIP is required, coverage for bodily injury is not. The insurance industry is pushing to scrap PIP and instead mandate all motorists to carry coverage that includes a minimum of $25,000 bodily injury if they are at fault. Eliminating PIP would mean that the $10,000 drivers now get paid toward medical costs through their insurers might not be there for them to pay for injured drivers. Importantly, payments would be reduced by approximately 60% due to claims being paid at commercial rates or through legal settlements instead of at the presently prevailing PIP fee schedule. This would negatively impact our seven diagnostic imaging facilities (both those we own and those we manage) with more unpaid bills, lower reimbursement rates and elongated waiting times.\nFONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n10. Federal and state privacy and information security laws. We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of PHI, including HIPAA and its implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended by the federal HITECH Act and collectively referred to as HIPAA. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nInformation security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.\n11. Changes in Domestic and Worldwide Economic Conditions. We are subject to risk arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets. Turbulence and uncertainty in the United States and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, revenues, profitability and business operations generally.", "PERMNO": 37154, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "FONR"}
