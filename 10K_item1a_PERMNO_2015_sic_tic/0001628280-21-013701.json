Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We may also make oral and written forward-looking statements from time to time, in reports filed with the SEC and otherwise. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future, unless otherwise required by law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the potential impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. The following section lists some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that we believe may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our Company. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K.\nWe cannot predict every event and circumstance that may affect our business, and therefore the risks and uncertainties discussed below may not be the only ones you should consider.\nThe risks and uncertainties discussed below are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally. Furthermore, as we continue to operate our business, we may encounter risks of which we are not aware at this time. These additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future, the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was first reported. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread throughout the world, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to increased market volatility. It also has disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended all Company-related travel unless absolutely necessary, and substantially all Company employees globally have been encouraged to work from home. We have either canceled or changed employee, customer and industry events to dial-in experiences. We may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. All of these changes may disrupt the way we operate our business.\nMoreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the rate of spending on our products and services, and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our offerings or the timing of our current\nor prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions; require pricing discounts or extended payment terms; or increase customer attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance.\nThe duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, the efficacy of vaccines and rates of vaccination in various states and countries, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners, vendors and the global economy. If we are not able to effectively respond to and manage the impact of such events, our business will be harmed.\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also amplify many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nDisruptions in the financial and credit markets, international trade disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic and other external influences in the U.S. and global markets may reduce demand for our software and related services, which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software, professional services and maintenance services. Regional and global changes in the economy and financial markets, such as the severe global economic downturn in 2008, which was followed by a slow and relatively weak recovery, have resulted in companies generally reducing their spending for technology projects and therefore delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products and related services. Adverse conditions in credit markets, lagging consumer confidence and spending, the fluctuating cost of fuel and commodities and their effects on the U.S. and global economies and markets are examples of negative factors that have delayed or canceled certain potential customer purchases. Furthermore, the uncertainty posed by the long-term effects of conflicts in the Middle East, terrorist activities, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other geopolitical and trade issues also may adversely affect the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers. Weakness in European economies may adversely affect demand for our products and services, both directly and by affecting U.S. customers that rely heavily on European sales. There can be no assurance that government responses to these factors will sufficiently restore confidence, stabilize markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit.\nWe are a technology company selling technology-based solutions with total pricing, including software and services, in many cases exceeding $500,000. Reductions in the capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions. These economic, trade, public health and political conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our products and services or renew existing post-contract support agreements, or their ability to pay for our products and services after purchase. Future declines in demand for our products or services, or a broadening or protracted extension of these conditions, would have a significant negative impact on our revenue and operating results.\nThere may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions.\nWe have been in the past, and may be in the future, affected by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software sale. During weak economic conditions, there is an increased risk that some of our customers will file a petition for bankruptcy. When our customers file a petition for bankruptcy, we may be required to forego collection of pre-petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the 90-day preference period preceding the filing. Accounts receivable balances related to pre-petition amounts may in some of these instances be large, due to extended payment terms for software fees and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects. The bankruptcy laws, as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy, may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition amounts, and may force us to disgorge payments made during the 90-day preference period. We also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions, as the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict. Although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate, and if they are not adequate, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We anticipate that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will increase the likelihood of these risks.\nChanges in the value of the U.S. dollar, as compared to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business, could harm our operating results.\nOur international revenue and the majority of our international expenses, including the wages of some of our employees, are denominated primarily in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. We do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenue and expenses and other commitments. For the foregoing reasons, currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused, and likely will continue to cause, variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur markets are very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe markets for our solutions are very competitive. The intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased, in part as a result of the slow growth in investment in IT software. We expect this intense competition to increase in the future. Our current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Any significant consolidation among supply chain software providers could adversely affect our competitive position. Increased competition has resulted and, in the future, could result in price reductions, lower gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. Each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them.\nWe directly compete with other supply chain software vendors, including SAP SE, Oracle Corporation, Blue Yonder, o9 Solutions, Kinaxis, Inc. and others. Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers. The software market has experienced significant consolidation, including numerous mergers and acquisitions. It is difficult to estimate what long-term effect these acquisitions will have on our competitive environment. We have encountered competitive situations where we suspect that large competitors, in order to encourage customers to purchase non-retail applications and gain retail market share, also have offered at no charge certain retail software applications that compete with our solutions. If competitors such as Oracle and SAP SE and other large private companies are willing to offer their retail and/or other applications at no charge, this may result in a more difficult competitive environment for our products. In addition, we could face competition from large, multi-industry technology companies that historically have not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully for customers against our current or future competitors, or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlso, some prospective buyers are reluctant to purchase applications that could have a short lifespan, as an acquisition could result in the application\u2019s life being abruptly cut short. In addition, increased competition and consolidation in these markets is likely to result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and changes in market share, any one of which could adversely affect us. If customers or prospects want fewer software vendors, they may elect to purchase competing products from a larger vendor than us since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products. Furthermore, some of these larger vendors may be able to bundle their software with their database applications, which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications. When we compete with these larger vendors for new customers, we believe that these larger businesses often attempt to use their size as a competitive advantage against us.\nMany of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. In addition, third parties may offer competing maintenance and implementation services to our customers and thereby reduce our opportunities to provide those services. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms. Furthermore, potential customers may consider outsourcing options, including application service providers, data center outsourcing and service bureaus, as alternatives to our software products. Any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.\nWe also face competition from the corporate IT departments of current or potential customers capable of internally developing solutions and we compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors, including:\n\u2022Internet (on demand) software vendors;\n\u2022single-industry software vendors;\n\u2022enterprise resource optimization software vendors;\n\u2022human resource management software vendors;\n\u2022financial management software vendors;\n\u2022merchandising software vendors;\n\u2022services automation software vendors; and\n\u2022outsourced services providers.\nAs a result, the market for enterprise software applications has been and continues to be intensely competitive. We expect competition to persist and continue to intensify, which could negatively affect our operating results and market share.\nDue to competition, we may change our pricing practices, which could adversely affect operating margins or customer ordering patterns.\nThe intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. For these and other reasons, in the future we may choose to make changes to our pricing practices. For example, we may offer additional discounts to customers; increase (or decrease) the use of pricing that involves periodic fees based on the number of users of a product; or change maintenance pricing. Such changes could materially and adversely affect our margins, and our revenue may be negatively affected if our competitors are able to recapture or gain market share.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nOur growth is dependent upon the successful further development of our direct and indirect sales channels.\nWe believe that our future growth will depend on developing and maintaining successful strategic relationships with systems integrators and other technology companies. We intend to continue to increase the proportion of customers served through these indirect channels, so we are currently investing, and plan to continue to invest, significant resources to develop them. This investment could adversely affect our operating results if these efforts do not generate sufficient license, subscription and service revenue to offset our investment. Also, our inability to partner with other technology companies and qualified systems integrators could adversely affect our results of operations. Because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels, increased indirect sales could reduce our average selling prices and result in lower gross margins. In addition, sales of our products through indirect channels will likely reduce our consulting service revenue, as third-party systems integrators generally provide these services. As indirect sales increase, our direct contact with our customer base will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating customer satisfaction and recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, these systems integrators and third-party software providers may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Marketing our products directly to customers and indirectly through systems integrators and other technology companies may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and, to the extent that different systems integrators target the same customers, systems integrators also may come into conflict with each other. Any channel conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on our relationships with systems integrators or harm our ability to attract new systems integrators.\nOur growth depends upon our ability to develop and sustain relationships with complementary vendors to market and implement our software products, and a failure to develop and sustain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.\nWe are developing, maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors, such as software companies, consulting firms, resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships, which could adversely affect our operating margins. We may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively. Our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive, and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause. Many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors. There can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us. The loss of relationships with such organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon the retail industry for a significant portion of our revenue.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant percentage of our revenue from the sale of software products and collaborative applications that address vertical market opportunities with manufacturers and wholesalers that supply retail customers. The success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry, which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the acquisition of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure, which is often accompanied by large-scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments. As a result, demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns in our customers\u2019 industries.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, we expect the retail industry to remain relatively cautious in its level of investment in IT when compared to other industries. We are concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions,\nconsolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain markets, especially if such weak economic conditions persist for an extended period of time. Weak and uncertain economic conditions have negatively affected our revenue in the past and may do so in the future, particularly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs, elongation of our selling cycles, and reduction in the demand for our products. As a result, in the current economic environment it is difficult to predict exactly when specific sales will close. In addition, weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products or services. We also believe the retail business transformation from retail brick-and-mortar to technology-enabled omni-channel commerce models will be a multi-year trend. Consequently, we cannot predict when the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic or the transformation to new commerce models may moderate or end. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, our quarterly or annual operating results and our financial condition.\nWe have observed that as the retail industry consolidates, it is experiencing increased competition in certain geographic regions that could negatively affect the industry and our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services. Such consolidation has negatively impacted our revenue in the past and may continue to do so in the future, which may reduce the demand for our products, and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our services revenue from a small number of customers. If these customers were to discontinue the use of our services or delay their implementation, our total revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our services revenue from a small number of customers. If these customers were to discontinue or delay their use of these services, or obtain these services from a competitor, our services revenue and total revenue would be adversely affected. Customers may delay or terminate implementation of our services due to budgetary constraints related to economic uncertainty, dissatisfaction with product quality, the difficulty of prioritizing numerous IT projects, changes in business strategy, personnel or priorities, or other reasons. Customers may be less likely to invest in additional software in the future or continue to pay for software maintenance. Our business relies to a large extent upon sales to existing customers and maintenance and services revenue are key elements of our revenue base, so any reduction in these sales or these maintenance and services payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may derive a significant portion of our revenue in any quarter from a limited number of large, non-recurring sales.\nFrom time to time, we expect to continue to experience large, individual customer sales, which may cause significant variations in quarterly fees. We also believe that purchasing our products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of a customer\u2019s capital resources. Therefore, a downturn in any customer\u2019s business, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in order cancellations or requests for flexible payment terms that could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and quarterly results. Moreover, continued uncertainty about general economic conditions could precipitate significant reductions in corporate spending for IT, which could result in delays or cancellations of orders for our products.\nOur lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict quarterly revenue levels and operating results.\nBecause fees for our software products are substantial and the decision to purchase our products typically involves members of our customers\u2019 senior management, the sales process for our solutions is lengthy. Furthermore, our existing and prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefits of our products, which may lead to delays in receiving customers\u2019 orders. Accordingly, the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict, and the delay of an order could cause our quarterly revenue to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors. Moreover, to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from individual software products and toward more costly integrated suites of software and services, our sales cycle may lengthen further, which could increase the likelihood of delays and cause the effect of a delay to become more pronounced. Delays in sales could cause significant shortfalls in our revenue and operating results for any particular period. Also, it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenue from sales of our products because our existing and prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our products before purchasing them. The period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer could be nine months or longer. During the evaluation period, prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons, including:\n\u2022reduced demand for enterprise software solutions;\n\u2022introduction of products by our competitors;\n\u2022lower prices offered by our competitors;\n\u2022changes in budgets and purchasing priorities;\n\u2022increased time to obtain purchasing approval; and\n\u2022reduced need to upgrade existing systems.\nServices revenue carries lower gross margins than do license or subscription revenue and an overall increase in services revenue as a percentage of total revenue could have an adverse impact on our business.\nBecause our service revenue has lower gross margins than do our license or subscription revenue, an increase in the percentage of total revenue represented by service revenue or a change in the mix between services that are provided by our employees versus services provided by third-party consultants could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results.\nFailure to maintain our margins and service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from implementation services. If we fail to scope our implementation projects correctly, our services margins may suffer. We bill for implementation services predominantly on an hourly or daily basis (time and materials) and sometimes under fixed price contracts, and we generally recognize revenue from those services as we perform the work. If we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services and cannot make corresponding cost reductions, or if the percentage of fixed price contracts increases and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts, our operating performance may suffer. The rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services;\n\u2022complexity of services performed;\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022pricing policies of our competitors and of systems integrators;\n\u2022use of globally sourced, lower-cost service delivery capabilities within our industry; and\n\u2022economic, political and market conditions.\nIf our customers elect not to renew maintenance contracts after the initial maintenance period and the loss of those customers is not offset by new maintenance customers, our maintenance revenue and total revenue would be adversely affected.\nUpon the purchase of a software license, our customers typically enter into a maintenance contract with a typical term of one to three years. If customers elect not to renew their maintenance contracts after this initial maintenance period and we do not offset the loss of those customers with new maintenance customers as a result of new license fees, our maintenance revenue and total revenue would be adversely affected.\nIf accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change or companies we acquire have applied such standards differently than we do or have not applied them at all, our reported revenue could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices or we may incur the expense and risks associated with an audit or restatement of the acquired company\u2019s financial statements.\nThere are several accounting standards and interpretations covering revenue recognition for the software industry. These standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance. We believe that we currently comply with these standards.\nThe accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of these pronouncements with the objective of providing additional guidance on their application and potential interpretations. These discussions and the issuance of new interpretations could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices, which could change the timing of recognized revenue. They also could drive significant adjustments to our business practices, which could result in increased administrative costs, lengthened sales cycles and other changes that could adversely affect our reported revenue and results of operations. In addition, companies we acquire historically may have interpreted software revenue recognition rules differently than we do or may not have been subject to U.S. GAAP as a result of reporting in a foreign country. If we discover that companies we have acquired have interpreted and applied software revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by U.S. GAAP, we could be required to devote significant management resources, and incur the expense associated with an audit, restatement or other examination of the acquired companies\u2019 financial statements.\nOur past and future acquisitions may not be successful and we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions.\nWe continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies. We have in the past acquired and invested, and may continue to acquire or invest in, complementary companies, products and technologies, and enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and investments present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include:\n\u2022risk that an acquired company or assets may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the company or assets were worth;\n\u2022difficulty of assimilating the operations and retaining and motivating personnel of an acquired company;\n\u2022risk that we may not be able to integrate acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;\n\u2022potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of an acquired company;\n\u2022adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate;\n\u2022dilution of existing equity holders caused by capital stock issuance to the shareholders of an acquired company or stock option grants to retain employees of an acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees and customers;\n\u2022potential assumption of liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u2022significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful; and\n\u2022issues with product quality, product architecture, legal contingencies, product development issues, or other significant issues that may not be detected through our due diligence process.\nAccounting rules require the use of the purchase method of accounting in all new business acquisitions. Many acquisition candidates have significant intangible assets, so an acquisition of these businesses would likely result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchase method of accounting for business combinations may require large write-offs of any in-process research and development costs related to companies being acquired, as well as ongoing amortization costs for other intangible assets. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized to income, but are subject to impairment reviews at least annually. If the acquisitions do not perform as planned, future write-offs and charges to income arising from such impairment reviews could be significant. In addition, these acquisitions could involve acquisition-related charges, such as one-time acquired research and development charges. Such write-offs and ongoing amortization charges may have a significant negative impact on operating margins and net earnings in the quarter of the combination and for several subsequent years. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such transactions.\nFully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. In addition, we may be able to conduct only limited due diligence on an acquired company\u2019s operations. Following an acquisition, we may be subject to liabilities arising from an acquired company\u2019s past or present operations, including liabilities related to data security, encryption and privacy of customer data, and these liabilities may not be covered by the warranty and indemnity provisions that we negotiate. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations.\nOur business may require additional capital.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our growth or to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, technologies or product lines. Our capital requirements may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022demand for our products;\n\u2022timing and extent of our investment in new technology;\n\u2022timing and extent of our acquisition of other companies;\n\u2022level and timing of revenue;\n\u2022expenses of sales, marketing and new product development;\n\u2022cost of facilities to accommodate a growing workforce;\n\u2022extent to which competitors are successful in developing new products and increasing their market shares; and\n\u2022costs involved in maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights.\nTo the extent that our resources are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing. However, additional funding, if needed, may not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Our inability to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our company by our current shareholders would be diluted.\nBusiness disruptions could affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. A natural disaster, public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo effectively mitigate this risk, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things, improving our key processes and IT infrastructure to support our business needs, and enhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well-connected and can effectively communicate with each other and our customers and employees can work remotely as appropriate.\nAlthough we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, in the event of a natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event, or if we fail to implement the improvements described above, we may be unable to continue our operations and may experience system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.\nOur international operations and sales subject us to risks associated with unexpected activities outside of the United States.\nThe global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances outside the United States. As we grow our international operations, we may need to recruit and hire new consulting, product development, sales, marketing and support personnel in the countries in which we have or will establish offices or otherwise have a significant presence. Entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels, and may involve the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software. International introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenue. In addition, the opening of a new office typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies. If we are less successful than we expect in a new market, we may not be able to realize an adequate return on our initial investment and our operating results could suffer. We cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire, that we will be successful at hiring, training or retaining such personnel or that we can expand or contract our international operations in a timely, cost-effective manner. If we have to downsize certain international operations, the costs to do so are typically much higher than downsizing costs in the United States. The following factors, among others, could have an adverse impact on our business and earnings:\n\u2022failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, software localization requirements;\n\u2022failure to properly comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services;\n\u2022compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in Europe, Asia and North America, including export requirements, tariffs, import duties and other trade barriers, as well as health and safety requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing;\n\u2022longer collection cycles;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers, including the economic burden and uncertainty placed on our customers by the imposition and threatened imposition of tariffs by the U.S., China and other countries;\n\u2022seasonal reductions in business activities, particularly throughout Europe;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022anti-American sentiment due to conflicts in the Middle East and U.S. policies that may be unpopular in certain countries;\n\u2022localized spread of infection resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including any economic downturns and other adverse impacts.\n\u2022political instability, adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency, including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d);\n\u2022impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s access to the European Union Single Market, the related regulatory environment, the global economy and the resulting impact on our business, including delays in execution of contracts by our customers;\n\u2022changes in general economic, health and political conditions in countries where we operate;\n\u2022potential labor strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns and work stoppages; and\n\u2022restrictions on downsizing operations in Europe and expenses and delays associated with any such activities.\nIt may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance.\nOur products are often critical to the operations of our customers\u2019 businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. If our products fail to function as required, we may be subject to claims for substantial damages. Courts may not enforce provisions in our contracts that would limit our liability or otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions and cybersecurity risks, this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover claims against us. In addition, our insurers may disclaim coverage for future claims. If claims exceeding the available insurance coverage are successfully asserted against us, or our insurers impose premium increases, large deductibles or co-insurance requirements, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities, including those relating to the unexpected failure of our products. In the current market, insurance coverage for all types of risk is becoming more restrictive, and when insurance coverage is offered, the amount for which we are responsible is larger. In light of these circumstances, it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels or, if such coverage is available, the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially. Consequently, we may be forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nGrowth in our operations could increase demands on our managerial and operational resources.\nIf the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers significantly expand, this may increase demands on our management and operations. Our officers and other key employees will need to implement and improve our operational, customer support and financial control systems and effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. We also may be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. We may not be able to manage future expansion successfully, and our inability to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS\nWe may not be successful in convincing customers to migrate to current or future releases of our products, which may lead to reduced services and maintenance revenue and less future business from existing customers.\nOur customers may not be willing to incur the costs or invest the resources necessary to complete upgrades to current or future releases of our products. This may lead to a loss of services and maintenance revenue and future business from customers that continue to operate prior versions of our products or choose to no longer use our products.\nWe may be unable to retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products.\nOver time, we have been required to migrate our products and services from mainframe to customer server to web-based environments. In addition, we have been required to adapt our products to emerging standards for operating systems, databases and other technologies. We will be unable to compete effectively if we fail to:\n\u2022maintain and enhance our technological capabilities to correspond to these emerging environments and standards;\n\u2022develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs; or\n\u2022anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nA substantial portion of our research and development resources is devoted to product upgrades that address regulatory and support requirements, leaving fewer resources available for new products. New products require significant development investment. That investment is further constrained because of the added costs of developing new products that work with multiple operating systems or databases. We face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products. If we do not attract sufficient customer interest in those products, we will not realize a return on our investment and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur core products face competition from new or modified technologies that may render our existing technology less competitive or obsolete, reducing the demand for our products. As a result, we must continually redesign our products to incorporate these new technologies and adapt our software products to operate on, and comply with evolving industry standards for, various hardware and software platforms. Maintaining and upgrading our products to operate on multiple hardware and database platforms reduces our resources for developing new products. Because of the increased costs of developing and supporting software products across multiple platforms, we may need to reduce the number of those platforms. In addition, conflicting new technologies present us with difficult choices about which new technologies to adopt. If we fail to anticipate the most popular platforms, fail to respond adequately to technological developments, or experience significant delays in product development or introduction, our business and operating results will be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition and implementation of such technologies may require us to make significant capital investments. We may not have sufficient capital for these purposes and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable products. The loss of revenue and increased costs from such changing technologies would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our products are not able to deliver quick, demonstrable value to our customers, our business could be seriously harmed.\nEnterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide faster returns on their technology investments. We must continue to improve our speed of implementation and the pace at which our products deliver value or our competitors may gain important strategic advantages over us. If we cannot successfully respond to these market demands, or if our competitors respond more successfully than we do, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments, our license, subscription and services revenue could be adversely affected.\nWe continuously evaluate new technologies and implement advanced technology into our products. However, if in our product development efforts we fail to accurately address, in a timely manner, evolving industry standards, new technology advancements or important third-party interfaces or product architectures, sales of our products and services will suffer. Market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines. We can license our software products for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures. There may be future or existing relational database platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design. In addition, the effort and expense of developing, testing, and maintaining software product lines will increase as more hardware platforms and operating systems achieve market acceptance within our target markets. Moreover, future or existing user interfaces may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design. If we do not achieve market acceptance of new user interfaces that we support, or adapt to popular new user interfaces that we do not support, our sales and revenue may be adversely affected. Developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules, which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations.\nOur software products and product development are complex, which makes it increasingly difficult to innovate, extend our product offerings, and avoid costs related to correction of program errors.\nThe market for our software products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. For example, existing products can become obsolete and unmarketable when vendors introduce products utilizing new technologies or new industry standards emerge. As a result, it is difficult for us to estimate the life cycles of our software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to the market in a timely and cost-effective manner, or that products, capabilities or technologies developed by our competitors will not render our products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to:\n\u2022continue to enhance and expand our core applications;\n\u2022continue to sell our products;\n\u2022continue to successfully integrate third-party products;\n\u2022enter new markets and achieve market acceptance; and\n\u2022develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance.\nDespite our testing, our software programs, like software programs generally, may contain a number of undetected errors or \u201cbugs\u201d when we first introduce them or as new versions are released. We do not discover some errors until we have installed the product and our customers have used it. Errors may result in the delay or loss of revenue, diversion of software engineering resources, material non-monetary concessions, negative media attention, or increased service or warranty costs as a result of performance or warranty claims that could lead to customer dissatisfaction, litigation, damage to our reputation, and impaired demand for our products. Correcting bugs may result in increased costs and reduced acceptance of our software products in the marketplace. Further, such errors could subject us to claims from our customers for significant damages, and we cannot assure you that courts would enforce the provisions in our customer agreements that limit our liability for damages. The effort and expense of developing, testing and maintaining software product lines will increase with the increasing number of possible combinations of:\n\u2022vendor hardware platforms;\n\u2022operating systems and updated versions;\n\u2022application software products and updated versions; and\n\u2022database management system platforms and updated versions.\nDeveloping consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our development resources and software product release schedules.\nThe use of open source software in our products may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nSome of our products use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that our open source software use does not require us to disclose the source code to the related product or solution, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software in software we license from such third party for our products and solutions, under certain circumstances we could be required to disclose the source code to our products and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property rights and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIf the open source community expands into enterprise application and supply chain software, our revenue may decline.\nThe open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use, distribution and modification, often free of charge. Open source software, such as the Linux operating system, has been gaining in popularity among business users. If developers contribute enterprise and supply chain application software to the open source community and that software has competitive features and scale to support business users in our markets, we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete successfully.\nImplementation of our products can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, customers may be unable to implement our products successfully, and we may become subject to warranty or product liability claims, which could be costly to resolve and result in negative publicity.\nOur products must integrate with the existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and may cause delays in the deployment of our products. Our customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products. Although we test each of our new products and releases and evaluate and test the products we obtain through acquisitions before introducing them to the market, there still may be significant errors in existing or future releases of our software products, with the possible result that we may be required to expend significant resources in order to correct such errors or otherwise satisfy customer demands. In addition, defects in our products or difficulty integrating our products with our customers\u2019 systems could result in delayed or lost revenue, warranty or other claims against us by customers or third parties, adverse customer reactions and negative publicity about us or our products and services, or reduced acceptance of our products and services in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in sales of software products that require customization would result in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract for those products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition.\nHistorically, we generally have been able to recognize software revenue upon delivery of our solutions and contract execution. Customers and prospects could ask for unique capabilities in addition to our core capabilities, which could cause us to recognize more of our software revenue on a contract accounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution. The period between the initial contract and the completion of the implementation of our products can be lengthy and is subject to a number of factors (over many of which we have little or no control) that may cause significant delays, including the size and complexity of the overall project. As a result, a shift toward a higher proportion of software contracts requiring contract accounting would have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe sometimes experience delays in product releases, which can adversely affect our business.\nHistorically, we have issued significant new releases of our software products periodically, with minor interim releases issued more frequently. Although we now issue software releases more frequently under our agile methodology, the complexities inherent in our software, major new product enhancements and new products often require long development and testing periods before they are released. On occasion, we have experienced delays in the scheduled release dates of new or enhanced products, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve future scheduled release dates. The delay of product releases or enhancements, or the failure of such products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance, could materially affect our business and reputation.\nWe may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years.\nDeveloping and localizing software is expensive, and investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain or improve our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these investments for several years, if at all.\nWe have limited protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights and may potentially infringe third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe consider certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws; confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties; protective contractual provisions (such as those contained in our agreements with consultants, vendors, partners and customers); and other measures to protect this information. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. We believe that the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factors such as:\n\u2022knowledge, ability and experience of our employees;\n\u2022frequent software product enhancements;\n\u2022customer education; and\n\u2022timeliness and quality of support services.\nOur competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. The laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be sold do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe generally enter into confidentiality or similar agreements with our employees, customers, and vendors. These agreements control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products, obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, or develop similar technology through reverse engineering or other means. Preventing or detecting unauthorized use of our products is difficult. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that such agreements will be enforceable. In addition, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of others\u2019 proprietary rights, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in significant costs and the diversion of resources. This could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us. Although we do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert or prosecute infringement or invalidity\nclaims against us. These claims could distract management, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, and result in costly and time-consuming litigation, including damage awards. Such assertions or the defense of such claims may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In addition, such assertions could result in injunctions against us. Injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. If third parties assert such claims against us, we may seek to obtain a license to use such intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If a patent claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement, we may be prevented from distributing our software or required to incur significant expense and delay in developing non-infringing software.\nWe may experience liability claims arising out of the sale of our software and provision of services.\nOur agreements normally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims and generally exclude consequential and other forms of extraordinary damages. However, these provisions could be rendered ineffective, invalid or unenforceable by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal, state, local or foreign laws or ordinances. For example, we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance or the provision of services. If a claim against us were to be successful, we may be required to incur significant expense and pay substantial damages, including consequential or punitive damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Even if we prevail in contesting such a claim, the accompanying publicity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\nWe also rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with our internally developed software. Although these third parties generally indemnify us against claims that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, such indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property. Often such third-party indemnifiers are not well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others. As a result, we may face substantial exposure if technology we license from a third party infringes on another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Defending such infringement claims, regardless of their validity, could result in significant cost and diversion of resources.\nPrivacy and security concerns, including evolving government regulation in the area of data privacy, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nGovernments in many jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting consumer data privacy legislation, including laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing and use of consumer data. For example, in 2016, the European Union adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018. The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we operate. In the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which expands upon the CCPA was passed in November 2020 and comes into effect on January 1, 2023, with a \u201clookback\u201d period to January 1, 2022. This legislation broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations.\nAdditionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products. Federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures dictated by these requirements. Moreover, we may be exposed to liability under existing or new data privacy legislation. Even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties that are assessed for each non-compliant transaction. If we or our customers were found to be subject to and in violation of any of these laws or other data privacy laws or regulations, our business could suffer and we and/or our customers would likely have to change our business practices.\nWe face risks associated with the security of our products, and if our data protection or other security measures are compromised and as a result our data, our customers\u2019 data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\nMaintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for our customers. Attempts by experienced computer programmers, or hackers, to penetrate customer network security or the security of web sites to misappropriate confidential information have become an industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers and networks across all platforms. We have included security features in certain of our Internet browser-enabled products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data. In addition, some of our software applications use encryption technology to permit the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information. Despite these security features, our products may be vulnerable to break-ins and similar problems caused by hackers, which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of our customers. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products (or the Internet in general) could lead some customers to seek to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitors\u2019 products which are not Internet-based applications. Customers may also increase their spending to protect their computer networks from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers and the cost of addressing such security problems may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough our agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure as a result of the situations listed above, such provisions may not be effective. Existing or future federal, state, local or foreign laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions could affect their enforceability. To date, we have not experienced any such product liability claims, but there can be no assurance that this will not occur in the future. Because our products may be used in essential business applications, a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, defending such a suit, regardless of its merits, could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management.\nWe depend on third-party technology, which could result in increased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products if it should become unavailable or if it contains defects.\nWe license critical third-party software that we incorporate into our own software products. We are likely to incorporate and include additional third-party software in our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings. The operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that third parties will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software, or even remain in business. Further, due to the limited number of vendors of certain types of third-party software, it may be difficult for us to replace such third-party software if a vendor terminates our license of the software or our ability to license the software to customers. If our relations with any of these third-party software providers are impaired, and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. In addition, if the cost of licensing any of these third-party software products significantly increases, our gross margin levels could significantly decrease.\nAny interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. From time to time we have experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, the risk of service interruptions may increase. Interruptions in our services may cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or terminate their agreements and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business also would be harmed if customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\nThese data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in providing our services until equivalent technology either is developed by us or, if available, is identified, purchased or licensed and integrated into our services.\nIf we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strain on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liability, result in customer losses and harm our business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to a cloud computing platform, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may adversely impact our business.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR PERSONNEL\nWe are dependent upon key personnel, and need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas.\nOur future operating results depend significantly upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key senior management and technical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, H. Allan Dow. None of our key personnel are bound by long-term employment agreements. We do not have in place \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. If we fail to retain senior management or other key personnel, or fail to attract key personnel, our succession planning and operations could be materially and adversely affected and could jeopardize our ability to meet our business goals.\nOur future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, retain and motivate other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and at times we have experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, including sales and marketing representatives, qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development, and personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and provide other services. The market for such individuals is competitive. Given the critical roles of our sales, product development and consulting personnel, our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel would adversely affect us. The software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. It may be particularly difficult to retain or compete for skilled personnel against larger, better-known software companies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel, attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses. We will continue to adjust the size and composition of our workforce to match the relevant product and geographic demand cycles. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe failure to attract, train, retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and sales efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service. In particular, the loss of sales personnel could lead to lost sales opportunities because it can take several months to hire and train replacement sales personnel. If our competitors increase their use of non-compete agreements, the pool of available sales and technical personnel may further shrink, even if the non-compete agreements ultimately prove to be unenforceable. We may grant large numbers of stock options to attract and retain personnel, which could be highly dilutive to our shareholders. The volatility or lack of positive performance of our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. The loss of key management and technical personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe periodically have restructured our work force, which can be disruptive.\nPeriodically, we have restructured or made other adjustments to our work force in response to factors such as product changes, geographical coverage and other internal considerations. Change in the structures of the work force and management can cause us to terminate and then hire new personnel, and/or result in temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity, which may affect revenue in one or more quarters. Future restructuring of our work force could occur, and if so we may again experience the adverse transition issues associated with such restructuring.\nOur technical personnel have unique access to customer data, and may abuse that privilege.\nIn order to properly render the services we provide, our technical personnel have the ability to access data on the systems run by our customers or hosted by us for our customers, including data about the operations of our customers and even about the customers of our customers. Although we have never had such an occurrence in the entire history of our Company, it is conceivable that such access could be abused in order to improperly utilize that data to the detriment of such customers.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE\nOur business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIn particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audits of that assessment have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. Over time, we have made significant changes in, and may consider making additional changes to, our internal controls, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and -operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our controls, policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIf in the future we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of the then current fiscal year (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a negative market reaction.\nOne shareholder beneficially owns a substantial portion of our stock, and as a result exerts substantial control over us.\nAs of June 30, 2021, James C. Edenfield, Executive Chairman, Treasurer and a Director of the Company, beneficially owned 1,821,587 shares, or 100%, of our Class B common stock, and 60,000 shares, or 0.18%, of our Class A common stock. If all of Mr. Edenfield\u2019s Class B shares were converted into Class A shares, Mr. Edenfield would beneficially own 1,881,587 Class A shares, which would represent approximately 5.66% of all outstanding Class A shares after giving effect to such conversion. As a result of Mr. Edenfield\u2019s ownership of Class B common stock, he has the right to elect a majority of our Board of Directors. Such control and concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that other shareholders might find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and Georgia law may inhibit a takeover of our company.\nOur basic corporate documents and Georgia law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nBecause Mr. Edenfield has the ability to elect more than half of the members of our Board of Directors, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules governing companies with stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Under these rules, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. As a controlled company, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that: (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors; (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Our Board of Directors does not have a majority of independent directors, and our compensation committee is not required to consist entirely of independent directors. We are not required to have, and have not chosen to establish, a nominating committee. Accordingly, our procedures for approving significant corporate decisions are not subject to the same corporate governance requirements as non-controlled companies with stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR STOCK PRICE\nWe could experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results that could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe have difficulty predicting our actual quarterly operating results, which have varied widely in the past and which we expect to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We base our expense levels, operating costs and hiring plans on projections of future revenue, and it is difficult for us to rapidly adjust when actual results do not match our projections. If our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the\nexpectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially. Revenue in any quarter depend on the combined sales activity of the American Software group of companies and our ability to recognize revenue in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Our sales activity is difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022we complete a significant portion of our customer agreements within the last few weeks of each quarter;\n\u2022if an agreement includes cloud services that are performed over the term of the contract, this requires all revenue to be spread over the term of the contract;\n\u2022our sales cycle for products and services, including multiple levels of authorization required by some customers, is relatively long and variable because of the complex and mission-critical nature of our products;\n\u2022the demand for our products and services can vary significantly;\n\u2022the size of our transactions can vary significantly;\n\u2022the possibility of adverse global political or public health conditions and economic downturns, both domestic and international, characterized by decreased product demand, price erosion, technological shifts, work slowdowns and layoffs, may substantially reduce customer demand and contracting activity;\n\u2022customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system evaluation and implementation due to changes in their strategic priorities, project objectives, budgetary constraints, internal purchasing processes or company management;\n\u2022customer evaluation and purchasing processes vary from company to company, and a customer\u2019s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time-consuming, even after selection of a vendor; and\n\u2022the number, timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and by our competitors may affect purchase decisions.\nVariances or slowdowns in our contracting activity in prior quarters may affect current and future consulting, training and maintenance revenue, since these revenue typically follow license or subscription fee revenue. Our ability to maintain or increase services revenue primarily depends on our ability to increase the number and size of our customer agreements. In addition, we base our budgeted operating costs and hiring plans primarily on our projections of future revenue. Because most of our expenses, including employee compensation and rent, are relatively fixed in the near term, if our actual revenue falls below projections in any particular quarter, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue increases. As a result, any shortfall in revenue in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses. As a result of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful. Therefore, predictions of our future performance should not be based solely on our historical quarterly revenue and operating results.\nOur stock price is volatile and there is a risk of litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been in the past and in the future may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following:\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations, published or otherwise, of the investment community;\n\u2022customer order deferrals resulting from the anticipation of new products, economic uncertainty, disappointing operating results by the customer, management changes, corporate reorganizations or otherwise;\n\u2022reduced investor confidence in equity markets, due in part to corporate collapses in recent years;\n\u2022speculation in the press or analyst community;\n\u2022wide fluctuations in stock prices, particularly in relation to the stock prices for other technology companies;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new products or the acquisition or loss of significant customers by us or our competitors;\n\u2022developments with respect to our proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022changes in investors\u2019 beliefs as to the appropriate price-earnings ratios for us and our competitors;\n\u2022changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other software companies;\n\u2022changes in management;\n\u2022sales of common stock by our controlling shareholder, directors and executive officers;\n\u2022rumors or dissemination of false or misleading information, particularly through Internet chat rooms, instant messaging, and other rapid-dissemination methods;\n\u2022conditions and trends in the software industry generally;\n\u2022the announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;\n\u2022domestic or international terrorism, public health crises including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other significant external factors; and\n\u2022the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits. Although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future, there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock. Defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur dividend policy is subject to change.\nOn May 26, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B common stock. The cash dividend will be payable on August 27, 2021 to Class A and Class B shareholders of record at the close of business on August 13, 2021. We currently expect to declare and pay cash dividends at this level on a quarterly basis in the future. However, our dividend policy may be affected by, among other things, our views on business conditions, financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans and other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant at that time. Our dividend policy has changed in the past and may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A change in our dividend policy could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may decline due to shares eligible for future sale or actual future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of June 30, 2021, if all of our outstanding Class B common shares were converted into Class A common shares, our current directors and executive officers of the Company as a group would beneficially own approximately 9.41% of all outstanding Class A common shares after giving effect to such conversion. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by these persons, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.", "PERMNO": 13777, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AMSWA"}
