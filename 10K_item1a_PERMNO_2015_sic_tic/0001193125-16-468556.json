{"cik": "1135971", "company": "PEPCO HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe businesses of each Reporting Company are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of any one or more of the Reporting Companies, including, depending on the circumstances, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, each risk factor set forth below applies to each Reporting Company.\nPHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation which significantly affects their operations. PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these requirements.\nThe regulated utilities that comprise Power Delivery are subject to extensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is regulated by the state agencies for each service territory in which it operates, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which utility service is provided to customers, as well as rates it can charge customers for the distribution and supply of electricity (and, additionally for DPL, the distribution and supply of natural gas). NERC has also established, and FERC has approved, reliability standards with regard to the bulk power system that impose certain operating, planning and cyber security requirements on Pepco, DPL, ACE and Pepco Energy Services. Further, FERC regulates the electricity transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL and ACE.\nApproval of these regulators is required in connection with changes in rates and other aspects of the utilities\u2019 operations. These regulatory authorities, and NERC with respect to electric reliability, are empowered to impose financial penalties, fines and other sanctions including setting rates at a level that may be inadequate to permit recovery of costs against the utilities for non-compliance with certain rules and regulations. In this regard, in December 2011, the MPSC sanctioned Pepco related to its reliability in connection with major storm events that occurred in July and August 2010. These sanctions included imposing a fine on Pepco and requiring Pepco to file a work plan detailing, among other things, its reliability improvement objectives and progress in meeting those objectives, while raising the possibility of additional fines or cost recovery disallowances for failing to meet those objectives.\nNERC\u2019s eight regional oversight entities, including ReliabilityFirst (RF), of which Pepco, DPL, ACE and Pepco Energy Services are members, and the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC), of which Pepco Energy Services is a member, are charged with the day-to-day implementation and enforcement of NERC\u2019s standards. RF and NPCC perform compliance audits on entities registered with NERC based on reliability standards and criteria established by NERC. NERC, RF and NPCC also conduct compliance investigations in response to a system disturbance, complaint, or possible violation of a reliability standard identified by other means. Pepco, DPL, ACE and Pepco Energy Services are subject to routine audits and monitoring with respect to compliance with applicable NERC reliability standards, including standards requested by FERC to increase the number of assets (including cyber security assets) subject to NERC cyber security standards that are designated as \u201ccritical assets.\u201d From time to time, Pepco, DPL and ACE have entered into settlement agreements with RF resolving alleged violations and resulting in fines. There can be no assurance that additional settlements resolving issues related to RF or NPCC requirements will not occur in the future. The imposition of additional sanctions and civil fines by these enforcement entities could have a material adverse effect on a Reporting Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nPHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries, as well as Pepco Energy Services, are also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses. Although PHI believes that each of its subsidiaries has, and each of Pepco, DPL and ACE believes it has, obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws, PHI is unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities or changes may have on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require any one or more of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or significant capital expenditures or to change the way it conducts its operations.\nPHI\u2019s profitability is largely dependent on its ability to recover costs of providing utility services to its customers and to earn an adequate return on its capital investments. The failure of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries to obtain timely recognition of costs and earn an adequate return on its capital investments in rates may have a negative effect on PHI\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe regulatory authorities that regulate PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries establish utility rates and tariffs intended to provide each utility the opportunity to obtain revenues sufficient to recover its prudently incurred costs, together with a reasonable return on investor supplied capital. These regulatory authorities also determine how Pepco, DPL and ACE recover from their customers purchased power and natural gas and other operating costs, including transmission and other costs. The utilities cannot change their rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. There can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will consider all costs to have been prudently incurred, nor can there be any assurance that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full and timely recovery of costs or a just and reasonable rate of return on investments. In addition, if the costs incurred by any of the utilities in operating its business exceed the amounts on which its approved rates are based, the financial results of that utility, and correspondingly PHI, may be adversely affected.\nFor example, PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries are exposed to \u201cregulatory lag,\u201d which refers to a shortfall in revenues in a utility\u2019s rate structure due to the delay in time or \u201clag\u201d between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates. All of PHI\u2019s utilities are currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because their investments in rate base and operating expenses are increasing more rapidly than their revenue growth. PHI anticipates that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.\nPrior to PHI\u2019s April 2014 entry into the Merger Agreement with Exelon, PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries, in an effort to minimize the effects of regulatory lag, had been filing electric distribution base rate cases every nine to twelve months in each of their jurisdictions, pursuing alternative ratemaking mechanisms, evaluating potential reductions in planned capital expenditures, and discussing with the regulatory community and other stakeholders the changing regulatory model economics that are causing regulatory lag. Any inability of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries to mitigate regulatory lag could have a material adverse effect on PHI\u2019s and each utility subsidiary\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. While the Merger has been pending, none of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries has filed any new distribution base rate cases, which is prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement without the consent of Exelon; to date, PHI has not requested such consent from Exelon. The absence of the filing of new distribution base rate cases since the entry of into the Merger Agreement in April 2014 and the maintenance of pre-Merger Agreement levels of infrastructure spending has increased the impact of regulatory lag on PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries.\nFailure to complete the Merger with Exelon could have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of PHI and each of its utility subsidiaries, and on the market price of PHI\u2019s common stock.\nIn August 2015, the DCPSC issued an order denying the merger application as originally filed by PHI and Exelon in the District of Columbia. Following subsequent negotiations with the District of Columbia Government and other interested parties, PHI, Exelon, Pepco and certain of their respective affiliates entered into the DC Settlement Agreement with the District of Columbia Government, the Office of the People\u2019s Counsel and other parties in which Exelon agreed to additional or modified undertakings, conditions and commitments related to the Merger. There can be no assurance, however, that the DCPSC will approve the Merger on the terms set forth in the DC Settlement Agreement or on any other terms.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended, either Exelon or Pepco has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement if the DCPSC does not approve the Merger, fails to act on the Merger in accordance with the timetable set forth in the DC Settlement Agreement, approves the Merger subject to conditions that are inconsistent with the terms of the DC Settlement Agreement, or one or more conditions to the closing of the Merger, as set forth in the Merger Agreement, as amended, has not been satisfied or waived on or before March 4, 2016 (the 151st day following the filing of the DC Settlement Agreement with the DCPSC). The termination of the Merger Agreement would likely have a negative impact on the trading price of PHI\u2019s common stock.\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement could also have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of PHI and each of its utility subsidiaries. Since the execution of the Merger Agreement in April 2014, each of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries has not filed any new distribution base rate cases, thereby foregoing rate increases that they might otherwise have sought, and has maintained its pre-Merger Agreement level of infrastructure spending in its service territory. As a consequence, if the Merger is not completed, PHI and each of its utility subsidiaries expect that they will be required to undertake certain actions to address their ongoing results of operations and financial condition. These actions are likely to include, but may not be limited to, a decrease in capital and operational and maintenance expenditures, and a reevaluation of PHI\u2019s common stock dividend policy.\nThe operating results of Power Delivery fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather.\nThe Power Delivery business historically has been seasonal and, as a result, weather has had a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally higher in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, each of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE historically has generated less revenue and income when temperatures are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. In addition, severe weather conditions can produce storms that cause extensive damage to the transmission and distribution systems, as well as related facilities, that can require the utilities to incur additional operation and maintenance expense, as well as capital expenditures. These additional costs can be significant and the rates charged to customers may not always be timely or adequately adjusted to reflect these higher costs.\nIn the District of Columbia and Maryland, Pepco and DPL are subject to a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism applicable to retail customers, which decouples distribution revenue for a given reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. The bill stabilization mechanism has the effect in those jurisdictions of reducing the impact of changes in the use of electricity by retail customers due to weather conditions or for other reasons on reported distribution revenue and income. A comparable revenue decoupling mechanism for DPL electricity and natural gas customers in Delaware is under consideration by the DPSC. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a bill stabilization adjustment or similar mechanism, operating results continue to be affected by weather conditions.\nFacilities and related systems may not operate as planned or may require significant capital or operation and maintenance expenditures, which could decrease revenues or increase expenses.\nOperation of the Pepco, DPL and ACE transmission and distribution facilities and related systems involves many risks, including: the breakdown or failure of equipment; accidents; labor disputes; theft of copper wire or pipe; failure of computer systems, software or hardware; and performance below expected levels. Older facilities, systems and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to provide reliable operations or to comply with changing environmental requirements. Thefts of copper wire or pipe increase the likelihood of poor system voltage control, electricity and streetlight outages, damage to equipment and property, and injury or death, as well as increasing the likelihood of damage to fuel lines, which can create an unsafe and potentially explosive condition. Natural disasters and weather, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution systems. Disruption of the operation of transmission or distribution facilities and related systems can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance.\nUpgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks may require substantial amounts of management\u2019s time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to employees\u2019 inexperience of using a new or upgraded system. In January 2015, PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries implemented an integrated customer billing and information management system to replace separate existing legacy customer billing and information systems. There can be no assurance that this new system will not cause disruptions to the utility subsidiaries\u2019 operations, which disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could harm their business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnergy companies are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nUtility companies, including PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries, have a large consumer customer base and as a result have been the subject of public criticism focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view energy companies such as PHI and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and may cause PHI and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent regulatory requirements. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing PHI\u2019s operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on PHI\u2019s and each utility subsidiary\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nUnfavorable regulatory developments and compliance with new or more rigorous regulatory requirements may subject PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries to higher operating costs.\nPHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries are subject to and will continue to be subject to changing regulatory requirements, including those related to reliability and customer service, in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, in 2012, the MPSC adopted rules establishing reliability and customer service requirements. In April 2015, both Pepco and DPL filed corrective action plans with the MPSC to address noncompliance in 2014 with certain of these reliability requirements. Both Pepco and DPL expect to file annual reports in April 2016 indicating that it has not complied with certain of these requirements for 2015. In addition, in July 2011, the DCPSC adopted regulations that establish specific maximum outage frequency and outage duration levels beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2020 and\nthereafter and are intended to require Pepco to achieve a reliability level in the first quartile of all utilities in the nation by 2020. The reliability standards permit Pepco to petition the DCPSC to reevaluate these standards for the period from 2016 to 2020 to address feasibility and cost issues.\nEach of Pepco and DPL may incur significant operating and maintenance and capital expenses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, each of Pepco and DPL could be subject to civil penalties or other sanctions if it does not meet the required performance or reliability standards. Other jurisdictions in which PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries have operations have already adopted or may in the future adopt reliability and customer service quality standards, the violation of which could also result in the imposition of penalties, fines and other sanctions. Compliance, and any failure to comply, with current, proposed or future regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on PHI and each utility subsidiary\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nPower Delivery\u2019s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners. Failures of neighboring transmission systems could have a negative impact on Power Delivery\u2019s operations.\nThe electricity transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL and ACE are interconnected with the transmission facilities of neighboring utilities and are part of the interstate power transmission grid. Pepco, DPL and ACE are members of the PJM RTO, a regional transmission organization that operates the portion of the interstate transmission grid that includes the PHI transmission facilities. Although PJM\u2019s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities, there can be no assurance that service interruptions originating at other utilities will not cause interruptions in the Pepco, DPL or ACE service territories. Thus, due to the interconnected nature of the interstate power transmission grid, an outage in a neighboring utility could trigger a system outage in either Pepco, DPL or ACE. If Pepco, DPL or ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its and PHI\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nChanges in technology, distributed generation and conservation measures may adversely affect Power Delivery.\nIncreased conservation and end-user generation made possible through current or future advances in technology, such as through fuel and solar (photovoltaic) cells, wind power and microturbines, could reduce demand for the transmission and distribution facilities of Power Delivery and adversely affect the results of operations of PHI and one or more of its utility subsidiaries. Alternative technologies that produce electricity, the development of which has expanded due to climate change and other environmental concerns, could ultimately provide alternative sources of electricity and permit current customers to adopt distributed generation systems which would allow them to generate electricity for their own use. As these and other technologies are created, developed and improved, the quantity and frequency of electricity usage by customers could decline, which could have a negative impact on the business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition of PHI or its utility subsidiaries.\nThe cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and implementation of new and existing environmental laws may increase operating costs.\nThe operations of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resource protection, site remediation, greenhouse gas emissions and health and safety. These laws and regulations may require significant capital and other expenditures to, among other things, meet emissions and effluent standards, conduct site remediation, complete environmental studies and perform environmental monitoring. If a company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to achieve compliance.\nIn addition, PHI\u2019s subsidiaries are required to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if there is a failure to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs.\nChanges in tax laws or their application, as well as the difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact a Reporting Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nEach Reporting Company is required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of its business operations and the financial and other transactions in which it engages in order to estimate its associated federal, state and local tax obligations. Such tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes and employment-related taxes. These judgments may be subject to challenge by the IRS or other taxing authorities. While each of the Reporting Companies is required to establish reserves to account for uncertain tax positions, the determination of the amount of such reserves also requires an exercise of judgment, and the amount of the reserve may be insufficient to cover the taxes that ultimately are determined to be due. Adverse tax authority rulings or unfavorable settlements with tax authorities involving matters for which an insufficient reserve has been established or involving other tax matters could have a material adverse effect on a Reporting Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in local, state, or federal tax laws or rates also could have adverse impacts on a Reporting Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to retain and attract key skilled and properly motivated professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on operations.\nPHI and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated systems and technology. One of the challenges they face in implementing their business strategy is to attract, motivate and retain a skilled, efficient and cost-effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to retirements, particularly in light of the delays experienced in connection with the Merger approval process. Over the course of the next three years, PHI estimates that approximately one-third of this skilled workforce will reach retirement age. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees, especially as existing skilled workers retire in the near future, could adversely affect the business, operations and financial condition of PHI or the affected company.\nPHI\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could impact their business and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 53% of employees of PHI and its subsidiaries, collectively, were represented by various labor unions. PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries are parties to five collective bargaining agreements with four local unions that represent these employees. Collective bargaining agreements are generally renegotiated every three to five years, and the risk exists that there could be a work stoppage after expiration of an agreement until a new collective bargaining agreement has been reached. Labor negotiations typically involve bargaining over wages, benefits and working conditions, including management rights. Although PHI believes that protracted work stoppages are unlikely, such an event could result in a disruption of the operations of the affected utility, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect upon the business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition of the affected utility and PHI.\nPepco Energy Services\u2019 thermal business in Atlantic City, New Jersey is dependent upon a few large customers and the loss of one or more of its significant customers would have a material adverse effect on Pepco Energy Services\u2019 results of operations and cash flow. (PHI only)\nRevenues associated with Pepco Energy Services\u2019 combined heat and power thermal generating facilities and operations in Atlantic City are derived from long-term contracts with a few major customers in the Atlantic City hotel and casino industry. The carrying amount of Pepco Energy Services\u2019 long-lived assets in Atlantic City at December 31, 2015 totaled $2 million, after impairment losses aggregating $81 million that were recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2014. In September 2014, two significant customers of these thermal operations declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. One of the customers closed operations in September 2014 and Pepco Energy Services continues to provide steam and chilled water service under a contract with lower rates which began April 1, 2015. The second customer terminated its contract with Pepco Energy Services on March 31, 2015. Two other significant customers of the thermal operations declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2015 and Pepco Energy Services continues to provide service to those customers under existing contracts. Future developments with respect to these and other customers in Atlantic City may require Pepco Energy Services to perform additional impairment analyses of the thermal operations and certain related assets. If these assets are determined to be further impaired, Pepco Energy Services would reduce the carrying value of these assets by the amount of the impairment and record a corresponding non-cash charge to earnings. Moreover, the contract changes and termination referred to above are expected to reduce Pepco Energy Services\u2019 future earnings and cash flows associated with its thermal operations in Atlantic City.\nUnder its energy savings performance contracts, Pepco Energy Services is responsible for maintaining, repairing and replacing energy equipment, which obligations may require Pepco Energy Services to incur significant costs many years after an installation of a project is completed. (PHI only)\nPepco Energy Services owns energy equipment and is also responsible for operating and maintaining additional energy equipment that it does not own. In addition, it is generally Pepco Energy Services\u2019 responsibility to repair or replace this energy equipment in the event of a failure. These equipment maintenance, repair and replacement obligations could be material and could adversely affect PHI\u2019s results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nPepco Energy Services\u2019 obligations in connection with its combined heat and power and underground transmission construction projects, energy savings construction projects and energy savings performance contracts may have a material adverse effect on PHI. (PHI only)\nPepco Energy Services has undertaken projects which include design, construction, startup and testing activities related to combined heat and power, underground transmission and energy savings construction projects, pursuant to guaranteed maximum price or fixed-price contracts. Pepco Energy Services will generally secure commitments from subcontractors and vendors to perform within contract pricing commitments, equipment-performance standards, jobsite safety requirements, and other key parameters. Under a number of these projects, the customer of Pepco Energy Services has required Pepco Energy Services to obtain surety bonds securing the performance of Pepco Energy Services, or its subcontractors or vendors. PHI has been required to guarantee the performance of Pepco Energy Services under the surety bonds and certain of these construction contracts. PHI also guarantees the obligations of Pepco Energy Services under certain of its energy savings performance contracts. At December 31, 2015, PHI\u2019s guarantees of Pepco Energy Services\u2019 obligations under its energy savings performance, combined heat and power, and construction contracts totaled $269 million, and PHI\u2019s guarantees of Pepco Energy Services\u2019 obligations under surety bonds for construction projects totaled $177 million.\nAs a result, PHI may bear responsibility in the event of unexcused failures by Pepco Energy Services or its subcontractors or vendors to perform in accordance with the terms of these contracts, or if the customer does not realize the energy savings provided for in a performance contract. When such events occur, Pepco Energy Services and PHI may experience reputational harm and claims for money damages and other relief that may be sought in connection with such contracts, guarantees and surety bonds, which could, depending upon the nature of the claim and the amount of damages or other relief sought, have a material adverse effect upon Pepco Energy Services\u2019 and PHI\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nIf PHI is not successful in mitigating the risks inherent in its business, its operations could be adversely affected.\nPHI and its subsidiaries are faced with a number of different types of risk. PHI confronts legislative, regulatory policy, compliance and other risks, including:\n\u2022\nPHI\u2019s inability to timely recover capital and operating costs, which may result in a shortfall in revenues;\n\u2022\nresource planning and other long-term planning risks, including resource acquisition risks, which may hinder PHI\u2019s ability to maintain adequate resources;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, including credit, interest rate and capital market risks, which could increase the cost of capital or make raising capital more difficult; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic risks, and risks related to economic conditions and changes in demand for electricity and natural gas in the service territories of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries (including changes due to or in connection with the loss of one or more commercial customers of a utility subsidiary), as well as with respect to Pepco Energy Services\u2019 business, which could negatively impact the operations of the affected business.\nPHI management seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in the implementation of PHI\u2019s business strategy through its established risk mitigation process, which includes adherence to PHI\u2019s business policies and other compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and groups, and overall business management. PHI management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks, and developing risk-management strategies, while the Board of Directors and its various committees oversee the assessment, management and mitigation of risk. However, there can be no assurance these risk mitigation efforts will adequately address all such risks or that such efforts will be successful, and a failure to successfully identify, assess, manage or mitigate such risks may have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition of one or more of the Reporting Companies.\nPHI and its subsidiaries are exposed to contractual and credit risks associated with certain of their operations.\nPHI and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of contractual and credit risks associated with certain of their operations. To mitigate contractual or credit risk, PHI or a subsidiary may give to or receive from the counterparty collateral or other types of performance assurance, which may be in the form of cash, letters of credit or parent guarantees, to protect against performance and credit risk. Even where collateral is provided, capital market disruptions, the lowered rating or insolvency of the issuer or guarantor, changes in the power supply other market prices and other events may prevent a party from being able to meet its obligations or may degrade the value of collateral, letters of credit and guarantees, and the collateral, guarantee or other performance assurance provided may prove insufficient to protect against all losses that a party may ultimately suffer. In the event of a bankruptcy of a counterparty to any contract to which PHI or any of its subsidiaries is a party, bankruptcy law, in some circumstances, could require the surrender of collateral or other guarantees held or payments received.\nBusiness operations could be adversely affected by physical and cyber attacks.\nThe threat of, or actual acts of, physical or cyber attacks may affect the operations of PHI and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force an increase in security measures and cause electrical disruptions or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, including natural gas. Utility industry operations require the continued deployment and utilization of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. While PHI has implemented protective measures designed to mitigate its vulnerability to physical and cyber threats and attacks, such protective measures, and technology systems generally, are vulnerable to disability or failure due to cyber attack, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. As a result, there can be no assurance that such protective measures will be completely effective in protecting PHI\u2019s infrastructure or assets from a physical or cyber attack or the effects thereof. If any of the infrastructure facilities of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries, including their transmission or distribution facilities, were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism or a cyber attack, the operations of PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE could be adversely affected. Furthermore, any threats or actions that negatively impact the physical security of the facilities of PHI or its subsidiaries, or the integrity or security of their computer networks and systems (and any programs or data stored thereon or therein), could adversely affect the ability of PHI or its subsidiaries to manage these facilities, networks, systems, programs and data efficiently or effectively, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on PHI\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, stockholder, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack or otherwise could subject PHI or its subsidiaries to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact PHI\u2019s or its utility subsidiaries\u2019 reputation with customers, stockholders and regulators, among others. Corresponding instability in the financial markets as a result of threats or acts of terrorism or threatened or actual cyber attacks also could adversely affect the ability of PHI or its subsidiaries to raise needed capital.\nNew accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how a Reporting Company reports its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nEach Reporting Company\u2019s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require the Reporting Companies to change their accounting policies. These changes are beyond the control of the Reporting Companies, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how they report their results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Each Reporting Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nUndetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.\nEach Reporting Company\u2019s internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable the Reporting Company to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations (including pursuant to federal and state administrative grant programs) applicable to it. Such compliance permits each Reporting Company to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of its costs and with the reporting requirements for each Reporting Company under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.\nEach Reporting Company has implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by each Reporting Company\u2019s management and PHI\u2019s Board of\nDirectors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While PHI believes these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the affected Reporting Company. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect the ability of a Reporting Company to access the capital markets.\nInsurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty, property or other losses that PHI and its subsidiaries might incur.\nPHI and its subsidiaries, including Pepco, DPL and ACE, as well as Pepco Energy Services, currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some risks and losses, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable, and, where a risk has been insured, a risk or loss may be deemed to be excluded from coverage or coverage may otherwise be denied in whole or in part. PHI has also obtained insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of its or its utility subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant, equipment, data or other assets, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds received, if any, will be sufficient to cover the entire loss, including costs of replacement or repair.\nPHI and its subsidiaries are dependent on obtaining access to the capital markets and bank financing to satisfy their capital and liquidity requirements. The inability to obtain required financing when needed would have an adverse effect on their respective businesses.\nPHI and its subsidiaries, including Pepco, DPL and ACE, have significant capital requirements, including the funding of construction expenditures and the refinancing of maturing debt. Each of the Reporting Companies relies primarily on cash flow from operations, access to the capital markets and medium- and long-term bank financing, to meet these long-term financing needs. The operating activities of PHI and its subsidiaries also require continued access to short-term sources of liquidity, including issuances by a Reporting Company of commercial paper and access to money markets and short-term bank financing, to provide for short-term liquidity needs that are not met by cash flows from their operations. Adverse business developments or market disruptions could increase the cost of financing or prevent PHI or any of its subsidiaries from accessing these sources of short-term and long-term capital. Events that could cause or contribute to a disruption of the financial markets include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\na recession or an economic slowdown;\n\u2022\nthe bankruptcy of one or more energy companies or financial institutions;\n\u2022\na significant change in energy prices;\n\u2022\na physical or cyber attack or threatened attacks;\n\u2022\nthe outbreak of a pandemic or other similar event; or\n\u2022\na significant electricity or natural gas transmission disruption.\nAny reductions in or other actions with respect to the credit ratings of PHI or any of its subsidiaries could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\nNationally recognized rating agencies currently rate each Reporting Company and debt securities issued by each Reporting Company. Ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. PHI or its\nsubsidiaries may, in the future, incur new indebtedness with interest rates that may be affected by changes in or other actions associated with these credit ratings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and previous ratings may not be maintained in the future. Rating agencies may also place a Reporting Company under review for potential downgrade in certain circumstances or if any of them seek to take certain actions that it believes would otherwise be in its best interests. A downgrade of these debt ratings or other negative action, such as a review for a potential downgrade, could affect the market price of existing indebtedness and the ability to raise additional debt without incurring increases in the cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings, or other negative action, could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth and to maintain or improve the current financial strength of PHI\u2019s business and operations.\nThe agreements that govern PHI\u2019s primary credit facility contain a consolidated indebtedness covenant that may limit discretion of each borrower to incur indebtedness or reduce its equity.\nUnder the terms of PHI\u2019s primary credit facility, of which each Reporting Company is a borrower, the consolidated indebtedness of a borrower cannot exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization. If a borrower\u2019s equity were to decline or its debt were to increase to a level that caused its debt to exceed this limit, lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such a default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict each Reporting Company\u2019s operational and financing flexibility.\nEach borrower\u2019s ability to comply with this covenant is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond the borrower\u2019s control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in PHI\u2019s equity include, without limitation, potential IRS taxes, interest and penalties associated with PHI\u2019s former cross-border energy lease investments or a significant write-down of PHI\u2019s goodwill. Even if each borrower is able to comply with this covenant, the limitations on its operational and financial flexibility could harm its and PHI\u2019s business by, among other things, limiting the borrower\u2019s ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that it may believe would be in its best interests or the interests of PHI\u2019s stockholders to complete.\nPHI\u2019s cash flow, ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its regulated and competitive operating subsidiaries, access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity. PHI\u2019s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of its subsidiaries. (PHI only)\nPHI is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its regulated and competitive subsidiaries, and all of PHI\u2019s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries. Accordingly, PHI\u2019s cash flow, its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries, each Reporting Company\u2019s access to the capital markets and all sources of cash flow and liquidity that may be available to PHI. PHI\u2019s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or dividends on equity securities issued by PHI or to make any funds available for such payments. The ability of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to PHI may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements made by PHI and its subsidiaries, including under the terms of indebtedness, and PHI\u2019s financial objective of maintaining a common equity ratio at its utility subsidiaries of between 49% and 50%. Because the claims of the creditors of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries are superior to PHI\u2019s entitlement to dividends, the unsecured debt and obligations of PHI are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, including trade creditors. In addition, claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of PHI\u2019s subsidiaries will generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of PHI\u2019s creditors.\nPHI has a significant goodwill balance related to its Power Delivery business. A determination that goodwill is impaired could result in a significant non-cash charge to earnings.\nPHI had a goodwill balance at December 31, 2015, of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily attributable to Pepco\u2019s acquisition of Conectiv (now Conectiv, LLC, to be referred to herein as Conectiv) in 2002. An impairment charge must be recorded under GAAP to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, as shown on the consolidated balance sheet. PHI is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: an adverse change in business conditions; a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall significantly below book value; an adverse regulatory action; impairment of long-lived assets in the reporting unit; or a change in identified reporting units. If PHI were to determine that its goodwill is impaired, PHI would be required to reduce its goodwill balance by the amount of the impairment and record a corresponding non-cash charge to earnings. Depending on the amount of the impairment, an impairment determination could have a material adverse effect on PHI\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe funding of future defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit plan obligations is based on assumptions regarding the valuation of future benefit obligations and the projected performance of plan assets. If market performance decreases plan assets or changes in assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations increase plan liabilities, any of the Reporting Companies may be required to make significant cash contributions to fund these plans.\nPHI holds assets in trust to meet its obligations under PHI\u2019s defined benefit pension plan and its post-retirement benefit plan. The amounts that PHI is required to contribute (including the amounts for which Pepco, DPL and ACE are responsible) to fund the trusts are determined based on assumptions made as to the valuation of future benefit obligations, and the projected investment performance of the plan assets. Accordingly, the performance of the capital markets will affect the value of plan assets. A decline in the market value of plan assets as well as a decline in the rate of return on plan assets may increase the plan funding requirements to meet the future benefit obligations. In addition, changes in interest rates affect the valuation of the liabilities of the plans. As interest rates decrease, the present value of the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Demographic changes, such as a change in the expected timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, also may increase the funding requirements of the plans. A need for significant additional funding of the plans could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows of any of the Reporting Companies. Future increases in pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plan costs, to the extent they are not recoverable in the base rates of PHI\u2019s utility subsidiaries, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flow and financial condition of any of the Reporting Companies.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and in PHI\u2019s constituent documents may discourage an acquisition of PHI. (PHI only)\nPHI is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (as defined in Section 203) for a period commencing three years from the date in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022\nthe board of directors approved the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nupon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation (excluding shares owned by officers, directors, or certain employee stock purchase plans); or\n\u2022\nat or subsequent to the time the transaction is approved by the board of directors, there is an affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder approving the transaction.\nSection 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover attempts against PHI, and accordingly, may discourage or prevent attempts to acquire or control PHI through a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Section 203 does not apply to the Merger.\nIn addition, and notwithstanding the proposed Merger with Exelon, PHI\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring PHI, even if doing so would be beneficial to its stockholders. For example, under PHI\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation, only its board of directors may call special meetings of stockholders. Further, stockholder actions may only be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent. Moreover, directors of PHI may be removed by stockholders only for cause and only by the effective vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of PHI entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (voting together as a single class) at a meeting of stockholders called for that purpose. In addition, under PHI\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to PHI\u2019s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings, and this provision may be amended or repealed by stockholders only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of PHI capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIssuances of additional series of PHI preferred stock could adversely affect holders of PHI\u2019s common stock. (PHI only)\nPHI\u2019s board of directors is authorized to issue shares of PHI preferred stock in series without any action on the part of PHI stockholders. PHI\u2019s board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock, including with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions, conversion rights, voting rights, and other preferential rights, limitations and restrictions. As of December 31, 2015, there were 18,000 shares of PHI Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. See Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - General Overview - Agreement and Plan of Merger with Exelon Corporation,\u201d for information regarding the outstanding Preferred Stock.\nIf PHI issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over PHI\u2019s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if preferred stock is issued with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of PHI\u2019s common stock or the market price of such common stock could be adversely affected. Furthermore, issuances of preferred stock can be used to discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring PHI where the acquisition might be perceived as being beneficial to stockholders.\nBecause Pepco, DPL and ACE are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of PHI and have directors and executive officers who are also officers of PHI, PHI can effectively exercise control over their dividend policies and significant business and financial transactions. (Pepco, DPL and ACE only)\nAll of the members of each of Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s and ACE\u2019s board of directors, as well as many of their respective executive officers, are officers of PHI, and Pepco, DPL and ACE are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of PHI. Among other decisions, each of Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s and ACE\u2019s board of directors is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, and subject to the financial covenants under each company\u2019s respective outstanding debt instruments, each of Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s and\nACE\u2019s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on its capital structure, which is based in part on earnings and cash flow, and also may take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries.\nIn the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by PHI in connection with an alternative acquisition proposal prior to the completion of the Merger, PHI could incur significant transaction costs that could materially impact its financial performance and results.\nPHI will incur significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing and other costs, relating to the Merger. If PHI terminates the Merger Agreement in connection with an alternative acquisition proposal made under certain circumstances, PHI will be required to pay Exelon a termination fee of $259 million plus reimbursement of Exelon for its expenses up to $40 million (which reimbursement shall reduce on a dollar for dollar basis any termination fee subsequently payable by PHI); if such acquisition proposal is made by a person who made an acquisition proposal between April 1, 2014 and the date of the Merger Agreement, PHI will be required to pay Exelon a termination fee of $293 million plus reimbursement of Exelon for its expenses up to $40 million (not subject to offset). The occurrence of either of these events could have a material adverse effect on PHI\u2019s financial results.\nPHI and its subsidiaries will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect PHI\u2019s financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees or vendors and others may have an adverse effect on PHI. Although PHI has taken steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair PHI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel while the Merger is pending, and could cause vendors and others that deal with PHI to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee retention and recruitment has been particularly challenging given the delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals for completion of the Merger, as current employees and prospective employees continue to experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite PHI\u2019s retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept new employment with PHI or its subsidiaries due to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, PHI\u2019s business operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPHI expects that matters relating to the Merger and integration-related issues will continue to place a significant burden on management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities. The diversion of management time on merger-related issues could affect PHI\u2019s financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts PHI and its subsidiaries, without Exelon\u2019s consent, from taking specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement is terminated, including, without limitation: (i) making certain acquisitions and dispositions of assets or property; (ii) exceeding certain capital spending limits; (iii) incurring indebtedness; and (iv) issuing equity or equity equivalents. These restrictions may prevent PHI from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nPending or potential future litigation against PHI and its directors challenging the proposed Merger may prevent the Merger from being completed within the anticipated timeframe.\nPHI and its directors have been named as defendants in a purported consolidated state class action lawsuit and a substantially similar purported federal class action lawsuit filed on behalf of public stockholders\nchallenging the proposed Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. If a plaintiff in these lawsuits or any other litigation that may be filed in the future is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the injunction may prevent the completion of the Merger in the expected timeframe or altogether.\nWhile PHI believes that these lawsuits are without merit, to avoid the risk of litigation delaying or adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the expense of defending such litigation, on September 12, 2014, PHI entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs to document the agreement in principle for the settlement of the state court lawsuit. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement or that the state court will approve the settlement even if the parties were to enter into such stipulation. In such event, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the memorandum of understanding may be terminated, which would create additional uncertainty relating to the consummation of the Merger.", "PERMNO": 23501, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "POM"}
