{"cik": "96869", "company": "TEJON RANCH CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our strategy, focused on more aggressive development of our land, involves significant risk and could result in operating losses. The risks that we describe in our public filings are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nStrategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the macro- and micro- environment in which we operate, including the demand for our products and services, the success of investments in our real estate development, technology and public policy.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our future homes and commercial products live could reduce the demand for our products and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Adverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our real estate products live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates, and population growth, or an oversupply of product for sale or lease may reduce demand and depress prices and cause buyers to cancel their purchase agreements. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry. Higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing, which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential, commercial or industrial sites. Any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments. Lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand. Any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development, which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing.\nWe are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals and permits for our developments that could be denied. In planning and developing our land, we are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, and construction. All of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations, so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied. In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area, which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project. Many states, cities and counties (including neighboring Ventura County) have in the past approved various \u201cslow growth\u201d or \u201curban limit line\u201d measures. If that were to occur in the\njurisdictions governing the Company\u2019s land use, our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected.\nThird-party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts. The land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex. Moreover, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals. As a result, the prospect of third-party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements. Third-party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop, or would, by their nature, adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. Environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site\u2019s location and condition, present and former uses of the site, and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species. Federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations, including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects\u2019 carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur additional costs for compliance, mitigation and processing land use applications, or preclude development in specific areas. In addition, in California, third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project. Certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously, so litigation challenging their approval is expected. Currently, the Centennial entitlement approval has been opposed through litigation against the Company and Los Angeles County. At Grapevine, the issues most commonly cited in opponents\u2019 public comments include the poor air quality of the San Joaquin Valley air basin, potential impacts of projects on the California condor and other species of concern, the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors, potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in Los Angeles County, emissions of greenhouse gases, water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being \u201csprawl.\u201d In addition, California has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state and efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects\u2019 carbon footprint in the future.\nUntil final permits are received, litigation is complete, and final maps are received, we will have a limited inventory of real estate. Each of our four current and planned real estate projects, TRCC, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine involve obtaining various governmental agency permits, overcoming litigation, and receiving final maps from local jurisdictions. A delay in achieving these items could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users.\nWe are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents. Within our real estate activities, we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in Northern, Central, and Southern California. We are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using Interstate 5 and State Route 99 for commercial leasing opportunities. Once they receive all necessary permits and approvals, Centennial and Grapevine will ultimately compete with other residential housing options in the region, such as developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes, so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects. Intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations.\nIncreases in taxes or government fees could increase our cost, and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce demand for homes in our future residential communities. Increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, any changes to income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners, such as a change limiting the deductibility of real estate taxes or interest on home mortgages, could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce future sales.\nOur developable land is concentrated entirely in California. All of our developable land is in California and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within California. Any adverse change in the economic climate of California, or our regions of that state, and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of California, or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities. Ultimately, our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land. We have in the past and may in the future encounter other difficulties in developing our land, including:\n\u2022Difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments;\n\u2022Natural risks, such as geological and soil problems, earthquakes, fire, heavy rains and flooding, and heavy winds;\n\u2022Shortages of qualified trades people;\n\u2022Reliance on local contractors, who may be inadequately capitalized;\n\u2022Shortages of materials; and\n\u2022Increases in the cost of materials.\nA prolonged downturn in the real estate market or instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry, could have an adverse effect on our real estate business. Our residential housing projects, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine, are currently in the litigation phase, permitting phase, or are fully entitled and waiting for development to begin. If a downturn in the real estate market or an instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases, our resort/residential business could be adversely affected. An excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available. The inability of potential commercial/industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOperational risk relates to risks arising from external market factors that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes weather and other natural conditions; regulatory requirements; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human resources and reputation.\nWe are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions. The real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, including:\n\u2022Employment levels\n\u2022Availability of financing\n\u2022Interest rates\n\u2022Consumer confidence\n\u2022Demand for the developed product, whether residential or industrial\n\u2022Supply of similar product, whether residential or industrial\nThe process of a project's development begins, and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market, which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed. It is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected.\nThe inability of a client tenant to pay us rent adversely affects our business. Our commercial revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our client tenants fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business. Some of our revenues are derived from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a client tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if our client tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if client tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could generate less cash flow from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those costs on to client tenants. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. We cannot be certain that our client tenants will be able to bear the full burden of costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other expenses that we pass along through our leases, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective client tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the markets we operate in may hinder or limit our ability to increase our rents, if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish.\nFrom time to time we experience shortages or increased costs of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control that cause delays or increased costs within our industrial development, which can adversely affect our operating results. Our ability to develop our current industrial development has in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control including: work stoppages, labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people; changes in laws relating to union organizing activity; and shortages, delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of building materials (including as a result of inflation). Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing infrastructure and buildings within our industrial development. If any of the above happens, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects. Our future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to pursue land development. Our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel.\nVolatile oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and natural gas prices, which are volatile. Oil and natural gas prices also impact the amount we receive for our mineral leases. Moreover, oil and natural gas prices depend on factors we cannot control, such as: changes in foreign and domestic supply and demand for oil and natural gas; weather; political conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibilities of insurgency or war in such areas; prices of foreign exports; domestic and international drilling activity; price and availability of alternate fuel sources; the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies; the level and effect of trading in commodity markets; and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental regulations. Substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Substantial or extended declines in future natural gas or crude oil prices could have an adverse effect on our future business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally decline as reserves are produced. Any decline in production or reserves could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\nWater delivery and water availability continues to be a long-term concern within California. Any limitation of delivery of SWP water, limitations on our ability to move our water resources, and the absence of available reliable alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards and possibly impact future development opportunities.\nOur future revenue and profitability related to our water resources will primarily be dependent on our ability to acquire and sell water assets. In light of the fact that our water resources represent a portion of our overall business at present, our long-term profitability will be affected by various factors, including the availability and timing of water resource acquisitions, regulatory approvals and permits associated with such acquisitions, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resources. Moreover, our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic and technological factors as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets. The factors described above are not within our control.\nNatural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. Natural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events including terrorist attacks, particularly those that may cause a decline in global economic activity could have a material adverse impact on our business, our operating results, and the market price of our common stock. Catastrophic events occurring anywhere in the world may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that\ncatastrophic events impact our client tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations. Disruptions to the global economy can also impact demand for and the prices of our products, which could adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations.\nOur results of operation have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a pandemic. This outbreak, which spread widely throughout the United States and to all other regions of the world, prompted federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States to declare states of emergency and institute preventative measures to contain and/or mitigate the public health effects. These preventative measures, which included quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and similar mandates that substantially restrict daily activities for many individuals, as well as orders calling for the closure and/or curtailment of operations for many businesses, continue to cause significant disruption to businesses in affected areas, as well as the financial markets both globally and in the United States, more broadly.\nOn a broader scale, we may also be materially and adversely affected by the disruptions to U.S. and local economies that result from the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer confidence, unemployment levels, inflation and fluctuating interest rates. The possibility of a prolonged recession or economic downturn could result in, among other things, a decrease in demand and consumer goods; diminished value of our real estate investments, including potential impairments.\nUltimately, the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operation, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, will depend upon future developments, including the widespread acceptance and dissemination of vaccines amongst the broader population; the duration and severity of existing social distancing and shelter-in-place orders even after vaccines are widespread and available; the continuation of higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees, which we expect could continue or could increase in these or other areas; further mitigation strategies taken by applicable government authorities; adequate treatments and the prevalence of widespread immunity to COVID-19; the impacts on our supply chain; the health of our employees, service providers and trade partners; and the reactions of U.S. and global markets and their effects on consumer confidence and spending. Such adverse effects, however, may also include decreases in: oil prices, commodity prices, and traffic, which our commerce center is highly dependent on.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgences or spread of any variants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business. We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. A material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of customer, employee or company data. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future. However, we cannot provide assurance that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems failure will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to our security and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats despite our attempts to mitigate these risks. We also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, may nonetheless leave us vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Additionally, violations of privacy or cybersecurity laws (including the California Consumer Privacy Act), regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action and other types of litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Therefore, any such security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations. Inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations. The farming operations are most affected by escalating costs, unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.\nInflation can adversely impact our real estate operations, by increasing costs of material and labor as well as the cost of capital, which can impact operating margins. In an inflationary environment, we may not be able to increase prices at the same pace as the increase in inflation, which would further erode operating margins.\nGovernment policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, trade tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on commodities and commodity products, can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions affecting our industry may adversely affect the supply of, demand for and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business and cause our financial results to suffer.\nOur efforts, goals and disclosures related to environmental stewardship and sustainability matters expose us to risks that can adversely affect our reputation and performance. Our commitment to sustainability with respect to climate change, air quality, and water conservation reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve our goals. Our failure, or perceived failure, to achieve these goals and objectives on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, stock price, operations, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nFinancial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including volatility in interest rates and commodity prices; credit risk; and liquidity risk, including risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations. We face credit risk in our industrial businesses, as well as in our investing and leasing activities and derivative financial instruments activities. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact an institution\u2019s financial condition or overall safety and soundness.\nConstriction of the credit markets or other adverse changes in capital market conditions could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital. During past economic downturns, we relied principally on positive operating cash flow, cash and investments, and equity offerings to meet current working capital needs, entitlement investment, and investment within our developments. Any slowdown in the economy could negatively impact our access to credit markets and may limit our sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital.\nWe regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may issue new equity securities through the public capital markets, enter new joint ventures, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. Adverse changes in economic, or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results.\nOur business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully (1) attract desirable strategic partners; (2) complete agreements with strategic partners; and/or (3) manage relationships with strategic partners going forward, any of which could adversely affect our business. A key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships. These joint venture partners bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets.\nA complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business. These competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates. If we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners, our business could be adversely affected.\nInability to comply with long-term debt covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our credit facility will depend, in part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve and the level of commodity prices related to our farming and mineral resource activities. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the addition of debt, the sale of equity, refinancing existing debt, or the sale of assets.\nOur credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth not greater than .75 to 1 at each quarter end, a debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.25 to 1.00, and a minimum level of liquidity of $20,000,000, including any unused portion of our revolving credit facility. A failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility and/or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may\nadversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt. From time to time, we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. Historically, our interest rate hedge agreements primarily related to our borrowings with variable interest rates based on LIBOR.\nHowever, in 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021, which was subsequently extended to June 30, 2023 for the overnight and one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month USD LIBOR. These decisions are subject to consultation, and announcements of the official cessation of any LIBOR settings will be made separately.\nAt or prior to the cessation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, we may need to amend our credit facility with our lender to be based\non the alternative rate that is established, if any, as a factor in determining the interest rate. The transition to an alternative rate will require careful and deliberate consideration and implementation so as to not disrupt the stability of financial markets. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. If we are unable to transition our contract to an alternative variable rate prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, we may be unable to utilize our credit facility.\nThe transition to SOFR may present challenges, including, but not limited to, the illiquidity of SOFR derivatives markets, which could make it difficult for financial institutions to offer SOFR-based debt products, the determination of the spread adjustment required to convert LIBOR to SOFR (and the related determination of a term structure with different maturities), the greater volatility of SOFR compared to that of LIBOR, and that such transition may require substantial negotiations with counterparties. Although daily pricing resets for SOFR have been noted to be more volatile than that of LIBOR, especially at month end, there is no sufficient evidence to establish how SOFR volatility compares to that of LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and potential alternatives at this time remains uncertain.\nMARKET RISKS\nMarket risk relates to the functioning of the marketplace. Many factors affect market function: investor anticipation, shocks in other markets, and anything that limits the efficient functioning of the marketplace. Market risks can affect the price of our Common Stock.\nOnly a limited market exists for our Common Stock, which could lead to price volatility. The limited trading market for our Common Stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our Common Stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our Common Stock.\nConcentrated ownership of our Common Stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price. As of March 3, 2022, directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately 21.9% of our Common Stock. Investors who purchase our Common Stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our Common Stock. The sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder\u2019s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the registration and sale of any significant number of additional shares of our Common Stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our Common Stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or fluctuate significantly.", "PERMNO": 57007, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "TRC"}
