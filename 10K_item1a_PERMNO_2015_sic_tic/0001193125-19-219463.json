{"cik": "1564708", "company": "NEWS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-08-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating the Company and its common stock. Any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Businesses Operate in a Highly Competitive Business Environment, and the Company\u2019s Success Depends on its Ability to Compete Effectively.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment, including both traditional and new content providers. This competition continues to intensify as a result of rapid changes in technologies and platforms, and the Company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other alternatives. For example, advertising and circulation revenues in the Company\u2019s News and Information Services segment may continue to decline, reflecting consumers\u2019 increasing reliance on a variety of content providers and platforms, including search engines, news aggregation websites, social media networks and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. In addition, due to the increased availability of high-speed internet access and innovations in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content through an increasing variety of providers. These providers include IPTV and SVOD services, such as Fetch TV, Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video, streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as YouTube and Facebook, as well as programmers and distributors, such as CBS, Disney and the FTA networks, that have begun providing content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. The increasing number of choices available to consumers for video content has caused some of the subscribers to the Company\u2019s pay-TV services to disconnect their services, downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers, and this may continue. This trend has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the Company\u2019s subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase television advertising from the Company.\nIn order to compete effectively, the Company must differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. For example, the Company relies on acceptance of the high-quality differentiated content in its newspapers, book titles, pay-TV programming and radio stations, as well as its wide array of digital and mobile products and services, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. However, when faced with a multitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. Online traffic and product purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. Search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that change frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. Any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the Company\u2019s businesses, including those affecting how the Company\u2019s content, apps and products are prioritized, displayed and monetized, could result in significant decreases in traffic to the Company\u2019s digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties, increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lower product sales and subscriptions or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nFrom time to time, the Company may pursue new strategic initiatives in order to remain competitive, such as its OTT strategy and its planned migration of subscribers from cable to satellite or internet delivery at its pay-TV business and its new concierge model for its U.S. digital real estate business. The Company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures, marketing and other costs in order to implement these strategies, which may be dilutive to its earnings. There can be no assurance these initiatives will be successful in the manner or\ntime period the Company expects or that it will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits it expects such strategy to achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is targeting a different demographic with its new streaming services, which are offered at a lower price point than its traditional broadcast subscription packages. However, if instead those streaming offerings cause broadcast subscribers to disconnect their services or downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages, the Company\u2019s revenues may be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors may have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content or other services and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer preferences and market conditions. Continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the Company\u2019s businesses operate may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content and other offerings. If the Company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company Must Respond to New Technologies and Changes in Consumer Behavior and Continue to Innovate and Provide Useful Products in Order to Remain Competitive.\nTechnology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the Company\u2019s products and services less valuable. For example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, often without charge, internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books, have empowered consumers to seek more control over the convenience and price of content consumption. Enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products and services. Consumption of the Company\u2019s content on new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. In addition, other technological developments, such as those allowing consumers to skip, fast forward through or block advertisements or otherwise time-shift viewing, may cause changes in consumer behavior that adversely affect the attractiveness of the Company\u2019s offerings to advertisers.\nTechnological developments have in many cases also increased competition by significantly lowering barriers to entry. For example, content providers are now able to compete with our pay-TV business via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. Other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the Company, often at a lower cost. This trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the Company\u2019s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content. Additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the Company\u2019s business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing.\nThe Company must continue to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers, are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them and are offered at competitive prices. The Company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior, and to attract\nand retain employees with the necessary skill sets and knowledge base. For example, the Company has made, and expects to continue to makes investments and incur costs in its pay-TV business as it continues to develop and improve its OTT services, including its recently-launched Kayo sports streaming service, Foxtel Now and other potential new OTT services. The development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, and there is a risk the Company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner and its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including new product offerings, may not be accepted by consumers or generate sufficient revenues to be profitable. The Company\u2019s failure to respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products and services to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base or its advertisers to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its business, asset values, results of operations and financial condition.\nA Decline in Customer Advertising Expenditures in the Company\u2019s Newspaper and Other Businesses Could Cause its Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services, digital media properties, cable channels and other pay-TV programming and radio stations. The Company\u2019s ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates and (8) advertising effectiveness.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. For example, circulation levels for the Company\u2019s newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the Company as well as advertising rates. For the Company\u2019s digital media properties, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. Any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending.\nThe increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. This shift has significantly impacted the Company\u2019s print advertising revenues in particular, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. In addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. Consequently, the Company\u2019s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption.\nThe digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. Digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. New delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. In addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness\nof its advertising such as blocking, changing the location of, or obscuring, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices and/or blocking or deleting cookies, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. As the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. In recent years, large digital platforms such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have extensive audience reach and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market, and the Company expects this trend may continue.\nThe Company\u2019s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, including consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation, advertisers\u2019 budgeting and buying patterns, which tend to be cyclical, as well as federal, state and local election cycles. In addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. Some of these sectors, such as retail, are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition. A decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the Company\u2019s overall advertising revenue.\nWhile the Company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. If the Company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. Reduced demand for the Company\u2019s offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and assets, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Inability to Obtain and Retain Sports, Entertainment and Other Programming Rights and Content Could Adversely Affect the Revenue of Certain of the Company\u2019s Operating Businesses, and Costs Could Also Increase Upon Renewal.\nCompetition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its pay-TV business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. The pay-TV industry, including the Company\u2019s pay-TV business, has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and SVOD programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including SVOD providers, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. Certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its pay-TV business, are party to contracts for sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. These contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. In the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms of these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as changes in the Company\u2019s bargaining power or in the industry, and in order to retain or extend such rights, the Company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs. Furthermore, third parties may outbid the Company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. In addition, as other content providers develop their own competing services, they may be unwilling to provide the Company with\naccess to certain content. For example, professional sports leagues or teams, as well as programmers and distributors such as CBS and Disney, have created and may continue to create their own direct-to-consumer offerings. Further, consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the Company. The loss of rights may adversely affect the breadth or quality of the Company\u2019s content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the Company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. In addition, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates.\nThe Company Has Made and May Continue to Make Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures That Introduce Significant Risks and Uncertainties.\nIn order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the Company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s senior management from the Company\u2019s operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (9) liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments and (10) in some cases, increased regulation. If any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the Company\u2019s existing businesses, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the Company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets.\nIn addition, the Company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business and possible retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business.\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. As of June 30, 2019, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is Australian dollars, had approximately $575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company\u2019s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the Company\u2019s reporting currency, primarily the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Since the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the Company\u2019s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. In particular, exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued political uncertainty in the U.K. and the negotiation of its exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nWeak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and Volatility and Disruption in the Financial and Other Markets May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe U.S. and global economies have undergone, and continue to experience, periods of economic and market weakness or uncertainty, including as a result of recent trade disputes between a number of countries. These conditions have in the past resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit and capital markets, limited access to the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. Such market disruptions have often led to broader economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the Company\u2019s business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. The Company is particularly exposed to certain Australian business risks, including specific Australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of Australian assets and generated approximately 40% of its fiscal 2019 revenues from Australia. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the Australian market, including, for example, recent weakness in the Australian residential real estate market which has led, and may continue to lead, to lower listing volumes at REA Group. The Company also generated approximately 13% of its fiscal 2019 revenues from the U.K., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty as it negotiates the terms of Brexit. While the impact of Brexit is difficult to predict, it could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary, political and regulatory landscape, lead other member countries to consider leaving the European Union, result in the diminishment or elimination of barrier-free access between the U.K. and other European Union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s businesses in the U.K. and elsewhere.\nIn addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the Company does business to satisfy their obligations to the Company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. Although the Company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the Company\u2019s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing.\nThe Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Loss, Improper Access to or Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs, Loss of Revenue, Reputational Damage or Other Harm to the Company\u2019s Business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s network management, are important to its business activities and contain the Company\u2019s proprietary, confidential and\nsensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and \u201ccloud-based\u201d systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company\u2019s business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events. Unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the Company does business. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the Company\u2019s network and information systems or compromise information security.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company\u2019s digital businesses expand. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the Company to date, individually or in the aggregate. While the Company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the Company\u2019s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, audience, advertisers, business partners or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company\u2019s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. The Company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate EU supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident, within strict time periods. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the Company\u2019s brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges.\nAs a result of adverse developments in the Company\u2019s industry and challenging market conditions, the Company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. Impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s taxes, including its ability to deduct certain interest costs. The Company\u2019s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the Company should recognize an impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads, distribution networks, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, trademarks and trade names, publishing rights and customer relationships, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the Company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. For example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue, the expected popularity of the programming for which the Company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of new products, including the Company\u2019s new SVOD services, could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. Any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the Company\u2019s reported results of operations. For example, in fiscal 2019, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $96 million, primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the News and Information Services segment. In addition, as of June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately $2.0 billion of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0% to 5%. The Company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends.\nThere Can Be No Assurance That the Company Will Have Access to the Credit and Capital Markets on Terms Acceptable to It, and the Significant Leverage of its Foxtel Operating Subsidiaries Could Limit the Ability of Those Subsidiaries to Access the Credit and Capital Markets and Have Other Adverse Effects.\nFrom time to time the Company expects to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness. Although the Company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, will permit the Company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the Company\u2019s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors. The Company\u2019s Foxtel operating subsidiaries have significant leverage that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt. As of June 30, 2019, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries\u2019 total outstanding indebtedness was $1.2 billion, including $281 million due in fiscal 2020, with the remainder having various maturities through fiscal 2025. Factors impacting the Company\u2019s ability to access the credit and capital markets include, but are not limited to: (1) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) the Company\u2019s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (3) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the \u201cDebt Documents\u201d); (4) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (5) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company (particularly as News Corp currently has no credit rating) will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects. A portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, which exposes the Company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. If interest rates increase, the applicable debt service obligations will increase, which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments and/or limit the amount of cash available for operations, including investments and capital expenditures. Although the Company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. In addition, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding Debt Documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from, among other things, undertaking certain transactions, disposing of properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, giving guarantees, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes. These instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the Foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified total debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. In the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the Foxtel operating subsidiaries\u2019 Debt Documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable Debt Documents, which could result in a default under other outstanding Debt Documents and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Changes in Governmental Policy and Regulation.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company\u2019s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. In addition, laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the United States, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. The Company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply.\nThe Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the Australian media industry or to Australian companies in general. This includes:\n\u2022\nanti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-TV providers such as Foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless:\n- national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event;\n- the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the Australian population; or\n- the rights are held by one of Australia\u2019s two major government-funded broadcasters;\n\u2022\nother parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that regulate ownership interests and control of Australian media organizations. Such legislation may have an impact on the Company\u2019s ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe Telecommunications Act and associated Codes, which apply various consumer protection regimes to Foxtel as a telecommunications service provider.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have\nimplications for how such data is managed. Many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require the Company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the Company\u2019s business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. The Company\u2019s failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. federal or state or foreign governments or private actors, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. Examples of such laws are the European Union\u2019s GDPR, which went into effect in 2018, expanding the regulation of personal data processing throughout the European Union and significantly increasing maximum penalties for non-compliance, and California\u2019s CCPA, which will take effect on January 1, 2020 and will put greater restrictions on the collection and use of personal information. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Data Privacy and Security\u201d for more information. Finally, because some of the Company\u2019s products and services are available on the internet, it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the Company does not have a substantial presence.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press. Following the inquiry, the U.K. Government established a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body. Publishers who are not members of an approved regulator, including the Company, may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. The majority of the U.K. press, including News UK, has established an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO. IPSO, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the Press Recognition Panel, has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the U.K. These powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to \u00a31 million for systemic breaches of IPSO\u2019s Editor\u2019s Code of Practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance.\nThe Company\u2019s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions.\nAdverse Results from Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business Practices and Operating Results.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 16 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of certain matters. The outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition as well as the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors.\nThe Company Could Be Subject to Significant Additional Tax Liabilities, which Could Adversely Affect its Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Australia and the U.K. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the Company\u2019s profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. Evaluating and estimating the Company\u2019s tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company\u2019s tax returns or positions taken by the Company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the Company. Although the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Financial Statements. As a result, the Company may be required to recognize additional charges in its Statements of Operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with the Separation, 21st Century Fox received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the Separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the Company and 21st Century Fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. If the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st Century Fox and/or the Company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st Century Fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock distributed to 21st Century Fox\u2019s stockholders on the Distribution Date over 21st Century Fox\u2019s tax basis in such shares. The Company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st Century Fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. Specifically, under the terms of the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement that the Company and 21st Century Fox entered into in connection with the Separation, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the Separation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st Century Fox\u2019s tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, or (3) the Company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the Company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st Century Fox as a result of such determination.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act instituted significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing a partial territorial tax system and, beginning in fiscal 2019, implementing changes to limits on the deductions for executive compensation, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income. While the Company\u2019s accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in the second\nquarter of fiscal 2019 and the Company believes those effects have been appropriately recorded, various interpretive issues remain with respect to the Tax Act and regulatory guidance on many aspects of the Tax Act has not been issued. The Company continues to monitor, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action arising because of the Tax Act and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act. The Company cannot predict the manner in which provisions of the Tax Act or any related regulations, legislation or accounting standards may be interpreted or enforced in the future or whether such interpretation or enforcement may have a material adverse effect on its income tax expense and/or its business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for more information regarding the impact of the Tax Act.\nOn May 31, 2019, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a program of work to develop a consensus solution in relation to its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action 1, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy. The outcome of this program may change various aspects of the existing framework under which the Company\u2019s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. In connection with the release of the program, several foreign jurisdictions introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services. There is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes to the Company\u2019s businesses and significant uncertainty as to what type of digital services will be deemed in scope. If these new taxes are applied to the Company\u2019s revenue in these foreign jurisdictions, which include the U.K., it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance.\nTheft of the Company\u2019s Content, including Digital Piracy and Signal Theft, may Decrease Revenue and Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business and Profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. Developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the Company\u2019s primary markets. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, these efforts are not always successful, and the Company cannot ensure that it will be able to reduce or control theft of its content. The proliferation of unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s content may have an adverse effect on its business and profitability by reducing the revenue that the Company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. Moreover, protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company\u2019s rights, or if existing laws are changed, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. In addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated, could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the Company\u2019s enforcement costs.\nThe Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends on a Single or Limited Number of Suppliers for Certain Key Products or Services, and Any Reduction or Interruption in the Supply of These Products and Services or a Significant Increase in Price Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-TV services. In particular, the Company depends on Optus\nto provide all of its satellite transponder capacity, and ARRIS and Technicolor are the Company\u2019s sole suppliers of satellite set-top boxes and the Foxtel Now box, respectively. If any of these suppliers breaches or terminates their agreements with the Company or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the Company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the Company\u2019s pay-TV programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the Company\u2019s pay-TV business, as well as its primary supplier of wholesale mobile voice and broadband services and the largest reseller of its cable and satellite products. Any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in Telstra\u2019s business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the Company\u2019s products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business.\nThe Company\u2019s International Operations Expose it to Additional Risks that Could Adversely Affect its Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nIn its fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, approximately 61% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived outside the U.S., and the Company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) compliance with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements such as the GDPR; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) compliance with local labor laws and regulations. For example, Brexit has and may continue to, among other things, adversely affect economic and market conditions in the U.K. and the European Union and create uncertainty around doing business in the U.K., including with respect to data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the Company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities.\nThe Company is Party to Agreements with Third Parties Relating to Certain of its Businesses That Contain Operational and Management Restrictions and/or Other Rights That, Depending on the Circumstances, May Not be in the Best Interest of the Company.\nThe Company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the Company. For example, the Company and Telstra are parties to a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement with respect to Foxtel containing certain minority protections for Telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement provides Telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the Board of Foxtel, as well as Board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent Foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the Company. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer\nrestrictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the Company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals.\nIn addition, Move, the Company\u2019s digital real estate services business in the U.S., operates the realtor.com\u00ae website under an agreement with NAR that is perpetual in duration. However, NAR may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. If the operating agreement with NAR is terminated, the NAR License would also terminate, and Move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com\u00ae website to NAR and provide NAR with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. NAR would then be able to operate a realtor.com\u00ae website, either by itself or with another third party.\nFailure by the Company to Protect Certain Intellectual Property and Brands, or Infringement Claims by Third Parties, Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operation and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses and other contractual arrangements, including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the NAR License and the Fox Licenses, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. The Company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. However, the Company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors and suppliers will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the Company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the Company operates or where its products are available. Any failure by the Company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. Claims of intellectual property infringement could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the Company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the Company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its business. In addition, the Company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims.\nNewsprint Prices May Continue to Be Volatile and Difficult to Predict and Control, and any Increase in Newsprint Costs or Disruption in Newsprint Supply may Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNewsprint is a significant expense for the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing units. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills or the conversion of newsprint mills to other products or grades of paper, which has reduced the number of newsprint suppliers over the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the Company\u2019s current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the Company\u2019s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. Any increase in the cost of newsprint, undersupply or supply chain disruption could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDamage, Failure or Destruction of Satellites and Transmitter Facilities that the Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends Upon to Distribute its Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. The Company\u2019s distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the Company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. Transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. Satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. These events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. Instead, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. However, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the Company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is Subject to Payment Processing Risk Which Could Lead to Adverse Effects on the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. The Company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payment processing, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to maintain its chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of the Company\u2019s ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nIn a variety of the Company\u2019s businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\nThe Market Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Fluctuate Significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; (3) success or failure of the Company\u2019s business strategy; (4) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting\nstandards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company\u2019s business; (7) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company\u2019s ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the Company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in Fox Corporation (\u201cFOX\u201d), and/or Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of FOX, Which May Result in the Diversion of Certain Corporate Opportunities to FOX.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers own shares of FOX\u2019s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of FOX, including K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Co-Chairman of FOX, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Co-Chairman and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FOX. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company and FOX. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Company and FOX regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and FOX may agree to implement, the Company and FOX agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws acknowledge that the Company\u2019s directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including K. Rupert Murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the Company and FOX), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of FOX and certain of its affiliates. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the Company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws) to FOX instead of the Company. This could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to FOX instead of the Company.\nCertain Provisions of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware Law, the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement and the Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust May Discourage Takeovers, and the Concentration of Ownership Will Affect the Voting Results of Matters Submitted for Stockholder Approval.\nThe Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock. In particular, the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\na dual class common equity capital structure;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting;\n\u2022\nspecial stockholders\u2019 meeting to be called only by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders give the Company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws;\n\u2022\nvacancies on the Board of Directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions on the transfer of the Company\u2019s shares; and\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock and Series Common Stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Separation, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in June 2014, June 2015 and again in June 2018. Pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the Company\u2019s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the Company additional shares of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding Class B Common Stock without approval of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock immediately following the Separation. The stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company\u2019s voting common stock without the approval of its Board of Directors. The rights expire on June 18, 2021, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. Further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the Murdoch Family Trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 38.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of August 5, 2019, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the Murdoch Family Trust. K. Rupert Murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. Also, K. Rupert Murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock as of August 5, 2019. Thus, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and approximately 39.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of August 5, 2019. This concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the Company. Additionally, the ownership concentration of Class B Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the Murdoch Family Trust will be adopted and proposals that the Murdoch Family Trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of Class B Common Stock. Furthermore, the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the Company\u2019s Board of Directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the Murdoch Family Trust\u2019s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval.", "PERMNO": 13964, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NWSA"}
