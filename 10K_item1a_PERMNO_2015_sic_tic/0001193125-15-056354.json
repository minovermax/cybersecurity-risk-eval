{"cik": "1430592", "company": "Financial Engines, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue and operating results can fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our share price to fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate from period-to-period in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this document:\n\u2022\na decline or slowdown of the growth in the value of financial market assets, which may reduce the value of assets we have under management and therefore our revenue and cash flows;\n\u2022\nfailure of our strategy to acquire new plan participants or our product and consumer marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nvariations in expected enrollment rates for our Professional Management service;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays of anticipated advertising, marketing promotions or rollouts of our services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the number of Professional Management members who withdraw all assets from their 401(k) plan, effectively terminating their relationship with us, or who decide to cancel their Professional Management program participation;\n\u2022\nchanges to economic terms in contracts with plan providers or plan sponsors, including renegotiations or unanticipated changes to the relationship;\n\u2022\nchanges in fees paid by us to plan providers for whom we are not acting as a subadvisor for data retrieval, transaction processing and fee deduction interfaces based on attaining contractually-agreed upon thresholds;\n\u2022\ndownward pressure on fees we charge for our services;\n\u2022\nmix in plan sponsors that choose our Active Enrollment or Passive Enrollment options;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays in expected service availability;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly revenue due to changes in fees paid by Professional Management members based on attaining contractually-agreed upon participation thresholds;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of an existing contract with a plan provider or a plan sponsor;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nfailure to enter into contracts with new plan sponsors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in the timing or cost of our enrollment and member materials or mix of subadvisory, advisory and Passive Enrollment materials sent to our Professional Management members and postage costs;\n\u2022\nelimination or reduction of contributions into members\u2019 401(k) plans or changes to the deductibility of contributions, which could reduce the growth rate of assets under management;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, regulatory policies or interpretations that could impact our ability to offer services to plan providers as a subadvisor or deploy services in a specific manner;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays in recognizing revenue based on timing of meeting specified milestones under contracts with customization and consulting services;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors to which we have to adapt; and\n\u2022\nnegative public perception and reputation of our Company or the financial services industry.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future revenue or operating performance.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is based on fees earned on the value of assets we manage. Our revenue and earnings could suffer if the financial markets experience a downturn or a slowdown in growth that reduces the value, or slows the growth, of our Assets Under Management.\nWe derive a significant and growing portion of our revenue from member fees based on the assets in the retirement accounts we manage, which we refer to as AUM. We allocate these assets among the investments available to each particular investor. For the workplace, the investment alternatives for a particular plan are selected by the plan\u2019s fiduciary, not by us, and may include retail mutual funds, institutional funds, exchange-traded funds, fixed-income investments and potentially higher volatility employer stock. In addition, our business is highly concentrated in 401(k) plans. The value of these investments can be affected by the performance of the financial markets globally, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and other factors. Our professional management revenue and fees are generally calculated using the value of AUM at the end of each month or quarter. Our methodology may result in lower fees if the financial markets are down when fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter. In addition, an economic downturn, changes in tax laws, or slowdown in growth could cause plan participants or their employers to contribute less to their 401(k) plans and cause fewer eligible employees to participate in 401(k) plans, which could adversely affect the amount of AUM. If plan participants are not satisfied with the performance of their retirement portfolios due to a decline in the financial markets or otherwise, our cancellation rates could increase, which in turn would cause our AUM to decline. Any potential decline in AUM would not necessarily be proportional to, and, in total, could be greater than, the overall market decline. If any of these factors reduces the value of assets we have under management, the amount of fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline, and our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue could be harmed if we experience unanticipated delays in expected service availability.\nWe generally do not earn platform fees from a plan sponsor until our services are available to plan participants, and we do not earn fees for our Professional Management service until we begin to manage a participant\u2019s account. If service availability is delayed due to actions or inactions on our part or on the part of a plan sponsor, plan provider or other third party, or due to matters beyond our control, our revenue would be harmed. This in turn would negatively affect our anticipated operating results and financial condition for a particular period.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our revenue could be harmed if we fail to enroll new Professional Management plan participants or if we experience increased cancellations or unanticipated variations in new enrollment campaigns.\nOur enrollment rate, and therefore our revenue, depend on plan participants signing up for or, in the case of a Passive Enrollment campaign, not declining, the Professional Management service. Increasing plan participant enrollment in our Professional Management service increases the AUM on which we earn fees. If we are unable to continue to increase our enrollment, our business may not grow as we anticipate. Unanticipated variations in the number, size, methodology or timing of enrollment campaigns, or our ability to employ ongoing enrollment techniques such as integration with provider websites or outbound calling, could also affect our revenue for a particular period. If we are not able to generate expected enrollment under a particular contract, this would negatively affect our revenue growth. For example, we have found that if plan sponsors do not use our standard enrollment campaign, enrollment rates tend to be lower. If fewer plan sponsors elect Passive Enrollment for their plan participants, which typically generates higher enrollment rates, our revenue may not grow at anticipated rates. Even when we have rolled out our Professional Management service at a particular plan sponsor, some plan participants may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the plan participant. Certain securities within a plan participant\u2019s account may be ineligible for management by us, such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions, and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account. As we endeavor to find new ways to grow enrollment, we may introduce processes or customer experiences that some plan providers, plan sponsors or plan participants reject or resist, which may result in an unsuccessful enrollment campaign, unsuccessful ongoing enrollment or higher cancellation rates, or may harm our reputation with those plan providers, plan sponsors or plan participants, thereby jeopardizing future enrollment with those parties. Further, individual plan participants whose accounts we manage may choose at any time to stop having us manage those accounts. Historically, member cancellations rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance and, in addition, member cancellation rates are typically the highest in the three months immediately following the completion of a given promotional campaign. The level of any potential cancellations or enrollment decline may not necessarily be proportional to, and may, in total, be greater than, the overall market decline. If we are unsuccessful in our Professional Management enrollment campaigns, if we lose plan participants, or if we otherwise fail to increase enrollment rates, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur growth strategy includes extending and expanding our services including entering new markets and we may not be able to develop a successful growth strategy, successfully implement new services, or accurately estimate the impact on our business of developing and introducing these services.\nOur strategy includes enhancing and expanding the functionality of our services with new features, offering new services with our existing market, and continuing to evaluate new opportunities in markets adjacent to our existing retirement income market. For example, one of our more recently developed features, Income+, manages plan participants\u2019 defined contribution assets while allowing payouts from their retirement accounts. We have limited experience determining and executing income payments from retirement accounts. If our assessments or forecasts with respect to the expected duration and sufficiency of assets to support retirement income payments to participants are inaccurate, or if we fail to ensure that payouts are made at the times expected, our business and reputation could suffer.\nIn the longer-term, we intend to further expand our services beyond workplace defined contribution plans. For example, in 2012 we began offering to manage assets in IRA accounts, and in 2013 expanded our IRA management to include Income+ capability. We have limited experience beyond workplace defined contribution plans. We may not be able to anticipate or manage new risks and obligations or legal, compliance, operational or other requirements that may arise when offering investment management or retirement income payout services for accounts other than 401(k) accounts or when offering other services related to preparing for retirement, such as assistance with optimizing social security payments. We may not be able to acquire clients in these new markets on a cost-effective basis, or at all.\nIndex to Financial Statements In furtherance of our strategy, we intend to invest significant resources to the research, development, sales and marketing of new services and features. A viable market for our new services or features may not exist or develop as we anticipated, and our offerings may not be well received by potential plan sponsor customers or individual plan participants or investors. We may not be able to develop effective marketing and advertising for new services and features. We may make incorrect decisions as we implement our strategy, such as decisions whether to design and build elements of our services in-house or procure them through third parties or through acquisition. We have no experience with strategic partnerships or acquisitions, and pursuing any such transaction would divert management attention, cause us to incur expenses and use internal resources, and may not be successful for a variety of reasons. As we expand our services in response to new or different customer demands, competition, in furtherance of our strategy, or for other reasons, we may not be able to accurately assess, design or implement testing protocols sufficient to identify all problems or limitations of the new features or services, we may make errors in the deployment of new features or services, or we may employ manual processes that are more prone to failure.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these future services on our business or how the benefits of these services will be perceived by our clients. In addition, the anticipated benefits of these services on our business may not outweigh the resources and costs associated with their development or acquisition, or the liabilities associated with their operation. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits of these services, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue is highly dependent upon a small number of plan providers with whom we have relationships, and the renegotiation or termination of our relationship with any of these plan providers could significantly impact our business.\nOur relationships and data connections with plan providers allow us to effectively manage plan participant accounts and integrate our services into plan providers\u2019 current service platforms. These relationships also provide us with an advantage in trying to sign potential plan sponsors. If a plan provider were to terminate our contract, reduce its volume of business, or substantially renegotiate the terms of its contract with us, our revenue could be harmed.\nWe refer to four of our eight primary retirement plan provider relationships as subadvisory relationships, including one plan provider with whom we have a subadvisory relationship for some plan sponsors and a direct advisory relationship for other plan sponsors. For the provider relationships that we refer to as subadvisory, we typically act as subadvisor to the plan provider acting as investment advisor, but we may directly act as investment advisor if Online Advice is the only service offered by a particular plan sponsor or for certain legacy plans. Where we act as subadvisor, we do not have a direct relationship with the plan sponsors and therefore may be less able to influence decisions by those plan sponsors to use or continue to use our services or to add additional services. Where we act as subadvisor, we do not know and cannot control the exact terms of the contract between the plan provider and the plan sponsor, which vary on terms such as the length of the contract, renewal and cancellation provisions. We have historically earned, and expect to continue to earn on a combined basis, a significant portion of our revenue through subadvisory relationships with retirement plan providers. The renegotiation or termination of our relationship with any of these plan providers could negatively impact our business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 11%, 9%, 7% and 7% of our total revenue was attributable to the subadvisory fees paid to us by Empower RetirementTM, Aon Hewitt, Vanguard and Voya, respectively, the four plan providers with whom we had subadvisory relationships as of December 31, 2014.\nOur contracts with our eight primary retirement plan providers generally have terms ranging from three to five years, and have successive automatic renewal terms of one year unless terminated in accordance with prior notice requirements. A majority of these provider agreements are in renewal periods. A plan provider may also terminate its contract with us at any time for specified breaches. Further, either party may decide to renegotiate the terms of the contract and may give a termination notice pending renegotiations to avoid having a contract automatically renew under its existing terms. In addition, there are unpredictable factors, other than our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nperformance, that could cause the loss of a plan provider. If we lose one of our plan providers with whom we have a relationship or if one of those plan providers significantly reduces its volume of business with us or renegotiates the economic terms of its contract with us, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nSome plan providers with whom we have relationships also provide or may provide competing services or products.\nSome plan providers with whom we have relationships, such as Fidelity, offer or may offer directly competing investment guidance, retirement advice, portfolio management and retirement income services to plan participants. We also face indirect competition from products that could potentially substitute for our services, most notably target-date funds, which are offered by a number of plan providers with whom we have relationships, including Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, J.P. Morgan, Voya and Empower RetirementTM Funds. Among the plan sponsors to whom we offer our Professional Management service and that offer target-date funds, approximately 93% offer target-date funds, of which approximately 79% offer retail-priced target-date funds. Plan providers who offer competing services or products may be better positioned to promote or offer their services or products over ours in the sales process. Where we have a subadvisory relationship with the plan provider, the plan provider may compete with us for plan sponsors. Competitors to our Income+ feature include providers of retirement income products in the defined contribution market, such as AllianceBernstein, Prudential, and other providers of insurance products. Competitors that provide advisory services in the IRA space include providers such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Vanguard.\nThis competition with companies with whom we have relationships can strain the relationship with plan providers and may result in less favorable contract terms or contract cancellation, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue is highly dependent upon the plan sponsors with whom we have relationships, and the renegotiation or termination of our relationship with one or more large plan sponsors could significantly impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated as a result of contracts with plan sponsors. Under these contracts, where we are providing advisory services directly and not in a subadvisory capacity, we typically earn annual platform fees that are paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the retirement plan itself as well as fees based on AUM that are generally paid by plan participants. These contracts with plan sponsors typically have initial terms of three or five years and continue thereafter unless terminated. At any time during the initial term or thereafter, a plan sponsor can cancel a contract for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract. A plan sponsor can generally terminate a contract after the initial term upon 90 days\u2019 notice. If a plan sponsor were to cancel or not renew a contract, we would no longer earn platform fees under that contract. In addition, we would no longer manage any assets in that plan and consequently would no longer earn fees based on AUM in that plan. A plan sponsor may also determine to contract through a subadvisory relationship with a plan provider or change to a different record-keeper, which may result in lower revenues for our company due to the contract terms. If one or more plan sponsors were to cancel their contracts with us, fail to renew those contracts, or move to a subadvisory relationship, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur Professional Management service makes up a significant and growing part of our revenue base. Our business could suffer if fees we can charge for these services decline.\nWe earn fees for our Professional Management service based on the value of assets in the accounts we manage, which we refer to as AUM. We believe that these services will continue to make up a substantial and growing portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. There are many investment advisory and management services and other financial products available in the marketplace, which puts downward pressure on fees for our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nProfessional Management service. Congressional, regulatory or industry attention focused on fees for financial services, such as legislative constraints on fees or rules requiring additional disclosure regarding fees, could result in downward pressure on fees or impose limits on the fees we can charge for our Professional Management service. Our contract terms may include thresholds, which upon attainment, may reduce the fees we charge for our Professional Management service. If we lower the fees we charge for our Professional Management service in response to regulatory, contractual or competitive pressure, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur failure to maintain or increase the number of plan sponsors with whom we have relationships could harm our business.\nOur future success largely depends on maintaining or increasing the number of plan sponsors with whom we have relationships. If the market for our services declines or develops more slowly than we expect, plan sponsors move to record-keepers that currently do not offer our services, or the number of plan sponsors that choose to provide our services to their plan participants declines, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. If the AUM represented by the plan sponsors with whom we have relationships declines, the failure to increase the number of plan sponsors that choose to provide our services to their plan participants could harm our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on plan providers and plan sponsors to provide us with accurate and timely plan and plan participant data in order for us to provide our services, and we rely on plan providers to execute transactions in the accounts we manage.\nOur ability to provide high-quality services depends, in part, on plan sponsors and plan providers supplying us with accurate and timely data in a usable format. Data transmissions from our plan sponsors and providers routinely contain errors or are not supplied in a timely manner. Although we have processes in place to attempt to detect and correct such errors and to encourage timely transmissions, our efforts may not be sufficient. Errors or delays in the data we receive from plan providers or plan sponsors, missing data, data transmitted in a format that we cannot readily use, or miscommunication about what data should be transmitted or in what format, could lead us to make advisory, transaction, disbursement or communication errors that could harm our reputation or lead to financial liability, or may prevent us from providing our services to, or earning revenue from, otherwise eligible plan participants. In addition, when we make changes in an account we manage, or direct a disbursement, we instruct the plan provider or IRA custodian to execute the transactions. If a plan provider or IRA custodian fails to execute transactions in an accurate and timely manner, it could harm our reputation or lead to financial liability. In turn, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may be liable to our plan sponsors, plan participants or plan providers for damages caused by system failures, errors or unsatisfactory performance of services.\nIf we fail to prevent, detect or resolve errors in our services, regardless of the cause of the errors, our business and reputation could suffer. Errors in inputs or processing, such as plan set-ups, transaction instructions or plan participant data could be magnified across many accounts. Concentrated positions held by many plan participants, particularly in employer stock, could result in a large liability if a systematic input or processing error was to cause us to make errors in transactions relating to those positions. We could also face liability if we fail to process a participant\u2019s instructions. We may not be able to identify or resolve these errors in a timely manner. In addition, failure to perform our services for Professional Management members, including plan disbursements, on a timely basis could result in liability. We may also have liability to the plan provider where we have a subadvisory relationship with the plan provider. We have reimbursed plan sponsors, participants and providers in the past for errors in our services and expect to do so in the future. After an error is identified, resolving the error and implementing remedial measures has at times diverted the attention and resources of our management, key technical personnel and internal resources from other business concerns. Any errors in the performance of services for a plan sponsor or plan provider, or poor execution of these services, could result in a\nIndex to Financial Statements\nplan sponsor or plan provider limiting our ability to market existing or enhanced services, or terminating its agreement. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services, these limitations on liability may be unenforceable in some cases, or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages. ERISA and other applicable laws require that we meet a fiduciary obligation to plan participants. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or may be unavailable in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. An insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims, or several smaller claims, against us that exceed our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co-insurance requirement, in which event our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf our reputation is harmed, we could suffer losses in our business and revenue.\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of plan providers, plan sponsors and plan participants that are current and potential customers, is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, lawsuits initiated by plan fiduciaries, plan participants, current or former employees, or stockholders, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest, rumors, communication errors, and transactional mistakes, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of our investment advice may not be the same or better than that of other providers could also damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain plan providers, plan sponsor customers and key personnel. This damage could also cause plan participants to stop using or enrolling in our Professional Management service, which would adversely affect the amount of AUM on which we earn fees, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of plan provider, plan sponsor or plan participant data could lead to legal liability, adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur services involve the exchange of information, including detailed information regarding plan participants provided by plan providers, plan sponsors, and retirement account custodians through a variety of electronic and non-electronic means. In addition, plan participants routinely input personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and, in some instances, credit card data, into our systems. We rely on a complex network of process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of data provided to us or stored on our systems. If we do not maintain adequate internal controls or fail to implement new or improved controls, this data could be misappropriated or confidentiality could otherwise be breached. As we expand our business and increasingly integrate our services with and rely upon third parties we may be subject to increased risk and liability for security breaches. We must devote increasing management time and resources to monitoring third-party security controls. We could be subject to liability if we inappropriately disclose any plan participant\u2019s personal information, or if third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any plan participant\u2019s name, address, portfolio holdings, credit card number or other personal information. Any such event could subject us to claims for unauthorized credit card purchases, identity theft or other similar fraud claims or claims for other misuses of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing or unauthorized access to personal information.\nMany of our agreements with plan sponsors and plan providers do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality, and consequential damages. If any person, including any of our employees, contractors, or consultants, penetrates our network security, misappropriates or mishandles sensitive data, inadvertently or otherwise, we could be subject to significant liability from our plan sponsors and plan providers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. In addition, our agreements with plan\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsponsors and plan providers require us to meet specified minimum system security and privacy standards. Given the growing concern over privacy and identity theft, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to increased scrutiny by both plan providers and plan sponsors, which have increased the frequency and thoroughness of their audits. If we fail to meet these standards, our plan sponsors and plan providers may seek to limit or terminate their agreements with us. Regulations in some states and proposed federal regulations may require notification via the press or to customers in the event of security breaches, which could harm our reputation and increase our costs of doing business. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, whether through breach of our computer systems, systems failure or otherwise, could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation, cause us to lose business, harm our revenue, operating results or financial condition and subject us to regulatory action, which could include sanctions and fines.\nPrivacy concerns could require us to modify our operations.\nAs part of our business, we use plan participants\u2019 personal data. For privacy or security reasons, privacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals may seek to restrict or prevent our use of this data. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Increased domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices, including self-regulation, could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expense, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAcquisition activity involving plan providers or plan sponsors could adversely affect our business.\nAcquisitions or similar transactions involving our plan providers or plan sponsors could negatively affect our business in a number of ways. After such a transaction, the plan provider or plan sponsor might terminate, not renew or seek to renegotiate the economic terms of its contract with us. Companies involved in these transactions may experience integration difficulties that could increase the risk of providing us inaccurate or untimely data or delay in service availability. Any of our existing plan sponsors may be acquired by an organization or a plan sponsor with no relationship with us, effectively terminating our relationship, or be acquired by a plan sponsor with an online services-only relationship rather than a Professional Management relationship which might cause us to lose business and harm our revenue, operating results or financial condition. Plan providers could be acquired by a company offering competing services to ours, which could increase the risk that they terminate their relationship with us, or be acquired by an organization with no relationship with us which might cause us to lose that plan provider, have to renegotiate the economic terms of their contract with us and harm our revenue, operating results or financial condition. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these corporate actions may have on our revenue, operating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to compete, succeed and generate profits depends, in part, on our ability to obtain accurate and timely data from third-party vendors on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe currently obtain market and other financial data we use to generate our investment advice from a number of third-party vendors. Termination of one or more of these vendor agreements, exclusion from, or restricted use of a data provider\u2019s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients. We do not currently have secondary sources or other suppliers for some of these data items and the lack of these resources may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If these data feed agreements were terminated, backup services would take time to set up and our business and results of operations could be harmed. We rely on these data suppliers to provide timely and accurate information, and their failure to do so could harm our business.\nIn addition, some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing content to us. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content, we may experience a reduction in our operating margins or market share, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our portfolio management and investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties or other obligations.\nOur portfolio management and investment advisory operations involve fiduciary obligations that require us to act in the best interests of the plan participants to whom we provide advice or for whom we manage accounts. We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties. We may not be able to prevent plan participants, plan sponsors or the plan providers to or through whom we provide investment advisory services from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty. Because we currently provide investment advisory services on substantial assets, we could face substantial liability to plan participants or plan sponsors if we breach our fiduciary duties. In addition, we may face liabilities for actual or claimed deficiencies in the quality or outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, investment management and other services, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty. While we believe that we would have substantial and meritorious defenses against such a claim, we cannot predict the outcome or consequences of any such potential litigation.\nCompetition could reduce our share of the portfolio management, investment advisory and retirement planning market and hurt our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment advice providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors and institutional customers. Direct competitors that offer independent portfolio management and investment advisory services to plan participants in the workplace include Morningstar, Inc., GuidedChoice and ProManage, LLC. Plan providers that offer directly competing portfolio management and investment advisory services to investors in the workplace include Fidelity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We currently have a relationship with Fidelity that allows us to provide our services to plan sponsors that elect to hire us for which Fidelity is the plan provider. We also face indirect competition from products that could potentially substitute for our portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income, most notably target-date funds. Target-date funds are offered by multiple financial institutions, including Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Principal Funds, Wells Fargo Advantage, J.P. Morgan, Voya and Empower RetirementTM Funds. These funds provide generic asset allocation based on the investment horizon of the investor. Target-date funds, managed accounts and balanced funds have been granted Qualified Default Investment Alternative, or QDIA, status by the Department of Labor. In addition, with the introduction of the Income+ feature, indirect competitors who offer income solutions in retirement include providers of insurance products. As the market for providing portfolio management and investment advisory services continues to grow, we also may face competition from smaller or newly established competitors, including investment advisors that provide portfolio management services delivered primarily through online channels and with minimal human intervention. Plan providers offer or may choose to offer directly and indirectly competitive products in the future. The plan providers with which we do not have contractually exclusive relationships may enter into similar relationships with our competitors. This in turn may harm our business.\nMany of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do or may have fewer regulatory or other constraints. This may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for services, to devote greater resources developing and promoting their services and to make more attractive offers to potential plan providers, plan sponsors and plan participants. Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition. Increased competition could result in price reductions or loss of market share, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, including our executive officers.\nOur ability to provide portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income and maintain and develop relationships with plan participants, plan providers and plan sponsors depends largely on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled professionals, particularly professionals with\nIndex to Financial Statements\nbackgrounds in sales, marketing, technology and financial and investment services. We believe that success in our business will continue to be based upon the strength of our intellectual capital. For example, due to the complexity of our services and the intellectual capital invested in our investment methodology and technology, the loss of personnel integral to our investment research, product development and engineering efforts would harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. Consequently, we must hire and retain employees with the technical expertise and industry knowledge necessary to continue to develop our services and effectively manage our growing sales and marketing organization to assist the growth of our operations. We believe there is significant competition for professionals with the skills necessary to perform the services we offer, particularly in the geographic area of our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations such as hedge funds and investment management companies that generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer higher compensation packages. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not have sufficient human resources programs, practices and benefits to be able to retain our existing employees, or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel. If we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to continue to expand our business would be impaired and our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf our intellectual property and technology are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, our business and competitive position could suffer.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We also require our employees, consultants, vendors, plan sponsors and plan providers to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. As of December 31, 2014, we have 16 issued U.S. patents which relate to novel aspects of our financial advisory platform, including user interface features, our pricing module, load-aware optimization, tax-aware asset allocation, financial goal planning, advice palatability, and other key technologies of our outcomes-based investing methodologies. We also have several additional pending U.S. patent applications. In addition, we have issued patents and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. One or more of our issued patents or pending patent applications may be called into question on the basis of being directed to abstract ideas or methods of doing or conducting business. The general validity of software patents and so called \u201cbusiness method\u201d patents have been challenged in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in patent laws or case law may impact the scope of patent-eligible subject matter by, for example, limiting what constitutes a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d Our patents may become less valuable if software or business methods are found to be a non-patentable subject matter or if additional requirements are imposed that our patents do not meet.\nThe steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. Our patent and trademark applications may not lead to issued patents and registered trademarks. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. The legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for doing so, which could harm our business. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and our monitoring and policing activities may not be sufficient to identify any misappropriation and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. If litigation is necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, any such litigation could be very costly and could divert management attention and resources.\nWe also expect that the more successful we are, the more likely it becomes that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours, which may infringe on our proprietary rights. If we are unable to\nIndex to Financial Statements\nprotect our proprietary rights or if third parties independently develop or gain access to our or similar technologies, our business, revenue, operating results, financial condition, reputation and competitive position could be harmed.\nThird parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, or our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may subject us to legal liability and harm our reputation.\nAssertion of intellectual property infringement claims against us, plan providers or plan sponsors could result in litigation. We might not prevail in any such litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if obtained, we may be unable to protect such licenses from infringement or misuse, or prevent infringement claims against us in connection with our licensing efforts. We expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if more of our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and business processes, and if we hire employees who possess third-party proprietary information. Any such claims, regardless of their merit or ultimate outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention and our resources away from our operations and otherwise harm our reputation. Our process for controlling employees\u2019 use of third-party proprietary information may not be sufficient to prevent assertions of intellectual property infringement claims against us. If we are not successful in overcoming such claims and are required to pay damages, licensing fees or fines, or alter our services or business practices, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny inability to manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe expect our growth to place significant demands on our management and other resources. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to execute on our growth strategy and to manage growth effectively. We rely on proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which require experienced personnel to operate, maintain and expand. Expansion creates new and increased management and training responsibilities for our employees. In addition, continued growth increases the challenges involved in:\n\u2022\nrecruiting, training and retaining sufficient skilled technical, marketing, sales and management personnel;\n\u2022\ndetermining when to use consultants or third-party software or services;\n\u2022\npreserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully enhancing and expanding the range of services offered to our plan sponsors and plan participants, and achieving such enhancement or expansion sufficiently quickly to meet new or different customer demands or competition;\n\u2022\ndeveloping, improving and scaling our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, compliance, recordkeeping, communications and other internal systems; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining high levels of satisfaction with our services among plan sponsors and plan participants.\nWe are subject to additional regulatory compliance requirements, as a result of being a public company, which causes additional expenses and challenges for our management team.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company related to corporate governance compliance. Such compliance includes the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010 as well as the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. The individuals who constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex and changing laws pertaining to public companies. Compliance with such requirements may divert internal resources\nIndex to Financial Statements\nand will take a significant amount of time and effort. We rely upon proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which increases the complexity of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and introduces more opportunities for error.\nWe are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that our management report on, and our independent auditors attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K. If our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, or if we fail to comply with other public company regulatory requirements, we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404 or other regulatory requirements, any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to meet public company regulatory compliance requirements effectively or efficiently, or there are changes in the standards, methods, estimates and judgments used in applying our accounting policies, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors.\nWe could face liability for certain information we disclose, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.\nWe may be subject to claims for securities law violations, negligence, or other claims relating to the information we disclose, such as the mutual fund assessments we call \u201cscorecards.\u201d Individuals who use our services may take legal action against us if they rely on information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites. We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data. These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies and transfer agents. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others. Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our operations are interrupted as a result of system failures or service downtime, our business and reputation could suffer.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to obtain and deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information. Key portions of our services are delivered using proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which require experienced personnel and cannot be duplicated by outside vendors or off-the-shelf products. Our operations and those of our plan providers and plan sponsors are vulnerable to interruption by technical breakdowns, computer hardware and software malfunctions, software viruses, infrastructure failures, fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures, Internet-based attacks and other events beyond our control. Any disruption in our services or operations could harm our ability to perform our services effectively which in turn could result in a reduction in revenue or a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure. We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities and other office equipment, which are located primarily in the seismically active San Francisco Bay area. We maintain off-site back-up facilities in Phoenix, Arizona for our database and network equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters. If we suffer a significant database or network facility outage, our business could experience disruption until we fully implement our back-up systems. We also depend on certain significant vendors for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfacility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at these locations. Any failure by these vendors to perform those services, any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our plan participants, harm our reputation, cause plan participants to stop using our investment advisory or Professional Management services, reduce our revenue and harm our business. Our agreements with our plan providers or plan sponsors also require us to meet specified minimum system security and privacy standards. If we fail to meet these standards, our plan sponsors and plan providers may seek to terminate their agreements with us. This in turn could damage our reputation and harm our market position and business.\nWe have an accumulated deficit and have incurred net losses in the past. We may incur net losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $15.5 million. We incurred net losses in each year through 2008. We may incur net losses in the future, in which event our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures and other anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain debt financing. If we decide to seek additional financing, it may result in additional dilution to existing stockholders or, in the case of debt, may result in additional operating or financial covenants. We have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing, if required, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in laws applicable to our services may adversely affect our business.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations promulgated by Congress, the SEC, Department of Labor or other U.S. regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets and our industry. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. For example, additional requirements for fee disclosure have become effective in recent years and there is increased sponsor and consultant focus on the fees associated with all plan services, including our services. We may need to offer more or broader services to justify our fees or may need to lower our fees to retain or expand our existing business relationships. Future legislation or regulation could change or eliminate certain existing restrictions relating to conflicts of interest, which might lower the relative value of our independence, or allow for increased competition. Legislation may reduce or eliminate tax benefits associated with defined contribution plans or otherwise restructure defined contribution plans in a way that affects their use by plan sponsors or plan participants, which could cause a reduction in the number of plans where our services are offered or slow our AUM growth. Future legislation or regulation could affect our ability to offer services for accounts other than 401(k) accounts or may impose requirements for retirement income forecasts and distribution that we might not be able to satisfy, or which might lower the relative value of our services or allow for increased competition. Changes to laws or regulations, or in their interpretation, or any change that results in our becoming subject to the jurisdiction of any additional regulator, such as a self-regulatory organization, could increase our potential liability for offering portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income, affect our ability to offer our Passive Enrollment option or invalidate pre-dispute arbitration clauses in our agreements, leading to increased costs to\nIndex to Financial Statements\nlitigate any claims against us. Changes to laws or regulations, or in their interpretation, could also increase our legal compliance costs, divert internal resources and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes. If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, which could materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to complex regulation, and any compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex and subject to rapid change. The activities of our investment advisory and management operations are subject primarily to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and ERISA, as well as certain state laws, some of which may provide for private rights of action. We are a fiduciary under ERISA. Our investment advisory services are also subject to state laws including anti-fraud laws and regulations. The Investment Advisers Act addresses, among other things, fiduciary duties, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements and also includes general anti-fraud provisions. We rely on certain regulatory interpretations and guidance in connection with our current business model, including regulations and guidance relating to passive enrollment of participants into our Professional Management service. If we are found to have failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, required to disgorge fees we have previously collected, required to reimburse clients for any losses in their accounts, required to change our business practices or disclosure, or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, or we may agree to one or more of such payments, sanctions or changes as part of a settlement agreement, which could materially harm our business and reputation. We may also become subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements as a result of any expansion or enhancement of our existing services or any services we may offer in the future. For example, we may be subject to insurance licensing or other requirements in connection with our retirement planning services, even if our activities are limited to describing regulated products. Compliance with any new regulatory requirements may divert internal resources and take significant time and effort. Any claim of noncompliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. This in turn could result in additional claims or class-action litigation brought on behalf of our clients, any of which could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources away from our operations. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). These principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in existing principles, standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our internal controls, operational and financial reporting processes.\nFor example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow U.S. GAAP and those that are\nIndex to Financial Statements\nrequired to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In connection with this initiative, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d - that supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions, even if we do not change the way in which we transact, such as billing for services or collecting cash. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption.\nFurther efforts by the FASB and IASB to converge U.S. GAAP and IFRS accounting principles may have a material impact on the way we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, lease accounting and financial statement presentation. In addition, the SEC may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of IFRS into the financial reporting system for U.S. companies. Changes in accounting principles from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, or to converged accounting principles, may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions.\nWe face additional scrutiny when we act as subadvisor, and any failure to comply with regulations or meet expectations could harm our business.\nSome of the plan providers to whom we are subadvisors are broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, referred to as the Exchange Act, and are subject to the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. When we act as a subadvisor, we may be subject to the oversight by regulators of another advisor. We may be affected by any regulatory examination of that plan provider.\nIn addition, our subadvisory arrangements are structured to follow Advisory Opinion 2001-09A, a Department of Labor opinion provided to SunAmerica Retirement Markets. Although an advisory opinion provides guidance about the Department of Labor\u2019s interpretation of ERISA, it is directly applicable only to the entity to which it is issued. SunAmerica Retirement Markets is an entity unrelated to us or the plan providers to which we act as subadvisor. We could be adversely affected if the Department of Labor increases examination of these subadvisory arrangements or changes the interpretive positions described in the Advisory Opinion. We could be adversely affected if ERISA is amended in a way that overturns or materially changes the Department of Labor\u2019s position in Advisory Opinion 2001-09A, such as the imposition of additional requirements relating to conflicts of interest on the plan providers to which we act as a subadvisor. Future legislation or regulation could impose additional requirements relating to conflicts of interest on some of the plan providers to which we act as a subadvisor. These plan providers may not be able to comply with these requirements, and we may therefore not be able to continue to provide our services on a subadvisory basis. In such event, we could incur additional costs to transition our services for affected plan providers and their plan sponsors to another structure.\nIf government regulation of the Internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change, we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses.\nThe adoption, modification or interpretation of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business or the overall popularity or growth in use of the Internet. Such laws and regulations may cover sales and other procedures, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, accessibility for those with disabilities, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, accessibility, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses, make it more difficult to renew subscriptions automatically, make it more difficult to attract new subscribers or otherwise alter our business model. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our business will suffer if we do not keep up with rapid technological change, evolving industry standards or changing requirements of plan sponsors, plan providers and plan participants.\nWe expect technological developments to continue at a rapid pace in our industry. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop our technological expertise, recruit and retain skilled investment and technology professionals, and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes:\nIn addition, we must continue to meet changing plan provider, sponsor and participant expectations and requirements, including addressing plan complexities and meeting demands for specific features and delivery dates. For example, we expect that plan participants will require delivery of our services through tablets or mobile devices and will expect a seamless experience across these channels. We must accomplish all of these tasks in a timely and cost-effective manner without material error, and our failure to do so could harm our business, including materially reducing our revenue and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, the 2014 range on intra-day sales prices for our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $69.72 to $29.40. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected results or our announcement of revenue or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in providing portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income;\n\u2022\nloss of a significant amount of existing business;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rates;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our plan sponsors or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amounts, timing or frequency of any cash dividends we may pay;\n\u2022\nthe amount, timing or frequency of any share repurchases;\n\u2022\nissuances, sales or expected sales of additional common stock; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks or natural disasters or other such events impacting countries where we or our plan sponsors have operations.\nPrior to fiscal year 2013, we did not pay any cash dividends on our common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 and $0.06 per share, respectively, of common stock outstanding. In February 2015, our Board of Directors\nIndex to Financial Statements\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. While we currently expect to pay comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, any future determination with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any changes in the amounts, timing or frequency of any cash dividends we may pay could adversely affect market and investors\u2019 perception of us and cause our stock price to decline.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry press or analysts cease covering our stock, publish negative research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the articles, research and reports that industry or securities analysts and press publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if industry press publishes negative articles about our company, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. A reduction in ownership by a large stockholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. In addition, on some days the daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low. The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price. Low trading volume may also make it difficult for a stockholder to make transactions in a timely fashion.", "PERMNO": 93305, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FNGN"}
