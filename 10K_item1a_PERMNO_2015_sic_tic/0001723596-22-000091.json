Risk Factors\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks. The investor should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding to make an investment decision regarding the Company\u2019s stock. The risk factors may cause future earnings to be lower or the financial condition to be less favorable than expected. In addition, other risks that the Company is not aware of, or which are not believed to be material, may cause earnings to be lower, or may deteriorate the financial condition of the Company. Consideration should also be given to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Economic Slowdown\nThe widespread outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, the longer the pandemic persists, the more material the ultimate effects are likely to be.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a global public-health crisis that resulted in challenging economic conditions for households and businesses and has negatively affected our business. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted a broad range of industries, although many areas of consumer spending have rebounded since the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect our business is unknown and will depend on the rate of continued spread of the virus, the overall severity of the disease and of new variants of the virus, the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, including the successful implementation of vaccination programs, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume. The longer the pandemic persists, the more material the ultimate effects are likely to be.\nMoreover, our success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers, many of whom have held officer positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19 could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nCertain actions taken by U.S. or other governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, that are intended to ameliorate the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 may cause additional harm to our business. Decreases in short-term interest rates, such as those announced by the Federal Reserve during the first fiscal quarter of 2020, have a negative impact on our results, as we have certain assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nThere is also currently uncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions that will emerge in the years following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, management is confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the pandemic on credit quality, revenues and asset values. We continue to have borrowers that have deferred payments on their loans, and we recognize that borrowers in certain industries are experiencing a slower recovery than certain other industries. We deferred foreclosures on certain one-to-four family loans as a result of federal and state foreclosure moratoriums, and now that foreclosures have resumed, we could experience losses on the impacted loans.\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nOur multifamily and commercial real estate lending practices expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nAt December 31, 2021, our multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolios totaled $3.2 billion, or 50.8% of our total loan portfolio. Our current business strategy is to continue our originations of multifamily and commercial real estate loans. These loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. These loans involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Further, we may increase our loans to individual borrowers, which would result in larger loan balances. To the extent that borrowers have more than one multifamily or commercial real estate loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. Moreover, if loans that are collateralized by multifamily or commercial real estate properties, become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial and multifamily real estate lending activities could curtail our growth and adversely affect our earnings.\nIn 2006, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. The balance of these real estate loans represented 236.5% of Columbia Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital at December 31, 2021, and our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by approximately 9.1% during the preceding 36 months.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies, among other things, indicate the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, our earnings would be adversely affected.\nOur origination of construction loans exposes us to increased lending risks.\nWe originate commercial construction loans, including speculative construction loans, primarily to professional builders for the construction and acquisition of personal residences, apartment buildings, retail, industrial/warehouse, office buildings and special purpose facilities. Speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of loan origination. At December 31, 2021, $295.0 million, or 4.7%, of our loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans, of which $207.6 million, or 70.4% consisted of speculative construction loans. In addition, we originate residential construction loans primarily on a construction-to-permanent basis with such loans converting to an amortizing loan following the completion of the construction phase. Our construction loans present a greater level of risk than loans secured by improved, occupied real estate due to: (1) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of estimating the building costs and the selling price of the property to be built; (2) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring the loan; (3) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest; and (4) the increased difficulty of working out loan problems. In addition, with respect to speculative construction loans, repayment often depends on the successful construction or development and ultimate sale of the property and, possibly, unrelated cash needs of the borrowers. Further, construction costs may exceed original estimates as a result of increased materials, labor or other costs. Construction loans also often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness.\nOur concentration of residential mortgage loans exposes us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, $2.1 billion, or 33.0%, of our loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family real estate, a significant majority of which is located in the State of New Jersey, and to a lesser extent New York and Pennsylvania, and we intend to continue this type of lending in the foreseeable future. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the local housing market or in the markets in neighboring states in which we originate residential mortgage loans could reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOur commercial business lending activities expose us to additional lending risks.\nWe make commercial business loans in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may fluctuate in value and may depend on the borrower\u2019s ability to collect receivables. We have increased our focus on commercial business lending in recent years and intend to continue to focus on this type of lending in the future.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the effect of existing economic conditions. In addition, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If the actual results are different from our estimates, or our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio, as well as any future credit deterioration, will require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, our banking regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and could require us to increase our provision for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the New Jersey and metropolitan New York and Philadelphia economies.\nWhile there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in northern New Jersey and in metropolitan New York and Philadelphia. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic event or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions, recent changes in tax laws or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. Further, deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses, which in turn could necessitate an increase in our provision for loan losses and a resulting reduction to our earnings and capital.\nEconomic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nProlonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and securities, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and elevated unemployment levels may result in higher loan delinquencies, increases in our non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reduction in problem assets can be slow, and the process can be exacerbated by the condition of the properties securing non-performing loans and the lengthy foreclosure process in New Jersey. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategies\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues.\nOur business strategy includes growth in assets and deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding deposit and lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and that require alternative delivery methods. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in modernizing existing facilities, opening new branches or deploying new services.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our strategy of growing through mergers and acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions are currently a component of our business model and growth strategy. Since November 2019, we have acquired Atlantic Stewardship Bank, Roselle Bank and Freehold Bank and, in December 2021, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire RSI Bank. It is possible that we could acquire other banking institutions, other financial services companies or branches of banks in the future. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and, therefore, may result in the dilution of our tangible book value per share. Our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on various factors, including: (1) our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities; (2) our ability to finance and complete transactions on acceptable terms and at acceptable prices; and (3) our ability to receive the necessary regulatory and, when required, stockholder approvals. Our inability to engage in an acquisition or merger for any of these reasons could have an adverse impact on the implementation of our business strategies. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including (1) our ability to achieve planned synergies and to integrate the branches and operations we acquire, and the internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations; (2) the integration process could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with existing customers; (3) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business and negatively impact our financial results and (4) our ability to identify potential asset quality issues or contingent liabilities during the due diligence process.\nIf our acquisition of RSI Bank is completed, the pro forma combined company may exceed $10 billion in assets, which could result in increased costs and/or reduced revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $9.2 billion. Based on our current total assets and growth strategy, and as a result of our pending acquisition of RSI Bank, we expect our total assets may exceed $10 billion in the near future. Accordingly, we will become subject to certain regulations that apply only to depository institution holding companies or depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.\nDebit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which is known as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a debit card issuer may receive per transaction at the sum of $0.21 plus five basis points. A debit card issuer that adopts certain fraud prevention procedures may charge an additional $0.01 per transaction. Debit card issuers with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, which currently includes the Company, are exempt from these interchange fee restrictions. The exemption for small issuers ceases to apply as of July 1st of the year following the calendar year in which the debit card issuer has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more at calendar year-end. As a result, if our acquisition of RSI Bank is consummated in 2022, we may become subject to the interchange restrictions of the Durbin Amendment beginning July 1, 2023.\nIn addition, an insured depository institution with total assets of $10 billion or more is subject to supervision, examination, and enforcement with respect to consumer protection laws by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB. Under its current policies, the CFPB will assert jurisdiction in the first quarter after the call reports of merging insured depository institutions, on a combined basis, show total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more for four consecutive quarters ended prior to the merger. As a result, we could become subject to CFPB supervision, examination and enforcement at the beginning of the quarter following consummation of our acquisition of RSI Bank.\nThere are other regulatory requirements that apply to insured depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. These include, but are not limited to, (i) the establishment by publicly traded depository institution holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets of a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices that are commensurate with the entity\u2019s structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size and (ii) an institution with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more no longer being entitled to benefit from the FDIC\u2019s offset of the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15% that is required for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nIn addition, Congress and/or regulatory agencies may impose new requirements or surcharges on these institutions in the future. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, includes provisions that, as they are implemented, relieve banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion (and that satisfy certain other conditions) from risk-based capital requirements, restrictions on proprietary trading and investment and sponsorship in hedge funds and private equity funds known as the Volcker Rule, and certain other regulatory requirements. Once we have total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, we will no longer qualify for any of the foregoing relief.\nThere can be no assurance that the benefits of the merger will outweigh the regulatory costs resulting from the Company having total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The increased regulatory costs resulting from the Company having total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more may negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities are checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days\u2019 notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve may hurt our profits and asset values and our strategies for managing interest rate risk may not be effective.\nWe are subject to significant interest rate risk as a financial institution with a high percentage of fixed rate loans and certificates of deposit on our balance sheet. From 2015 to 2018 the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Open Market Committee increased its federal funds rate target from a range of 0.00% to 0.25% to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%. However, beginning in July 2019, the Committee began lowering the target rate in response to a slowing economy, and in March 2020, lowered their target rate back to 0.00% to 0.25% in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This resulted in a steepening of the yield curve to a flattening of the curve as long-term rates fell shortly thereafter. Our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, included a number of provisions that have had an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, other changes which could effect our borrowers include: (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThese changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, such as New Jersey and New York. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, legislation in New Jersey that was adopted in July 2018 has increased our state income tax liability and our overall tax expense. The legislation imposed a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $1 million of 2.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. Subsequently, in September 2020, New Jersey enacted legislation that restored and extended the 2.5% Corporation Business Tax surcharge to apply retroactively from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023. The 2018 legislation also required combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, changing New Jersey\u2019s current status as a separate return state, and limited the deductibility of dividends received.\nThese changes are not temporary. All regulations implementing the legislative changes have not yet been issued, so we cannot fully evaluate the impact of the legislation on our overall tax expense. However, the legislation may cause us to lose the benefit of certain of our tax management strategies and may cause our total tax expense to increase.\nMunicipal deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of such deposits may hurt our profits.\nMunicipal deposits are an important source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2021, $702.0 million, or 9.3%, of our total deposits were comprised of municipal deposits, including public funds deposits from local government entities primarily domiciled in the State of New Jersey. Given our use of these high-average balance municipal deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. In addition, our municipal deposits are primarily demand deposit accounts or short-term deposits and therefore are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our municipal deposits to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain those funds and we are forced to turn to borrowing sources for our lending and investment activities, the interest expense associated with such borrowings may be higher than the rates we are paying on our municipal deposits, which could adversely affect our net income.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and cybersecurity threats could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we also outsource certain cybersecurity functions, such as penetration testing, to third party service providers, and the failure of these service providers to adequately perform such functions could increase our exposure to security breaches and cybersecurity threats. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Any such breach or attacks could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available, as well as related essential personnel. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry into the financial services market and made it possible for financial technology companies and other non-bank entities to offer financial products and services traditionally provided by banks. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and\nthe failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or outside persons, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. Although our control testing has not identified any significant deficiencies in our internal control system, a breakdown in our internal control system, improper operation of our systems or improper employee actions could result in material financial loss to us, the imposition of regulatory action, and damage to our reputation.\nThe building of market share through our branch office strategy, and our ability to achieve profitability on new branch offices, may increase our expenses and negatively affect our earnings.\nWe believe there are branch expansion opportunities within our market area and adjacent markets, including other states, and will seek to grow our deposit base by adding branches to our existing branch network. There are considerable costs involved in opening branch offices, especially in light of the capabilities needed to compete in today\u2019s environment. Moreover, new branch offices generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, new branch offices could negatively impact our earnings and may do so for some period of time. Our investments in products and services, and the related personnel required to implement new policies and procedures, take time to earn returns and can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for the foreseeable future. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branch offices will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branch offices.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. We continue to face stiff competition for one-to-four family residential loans from other financial service providers, including large national residential lenders and local community banks. Other competitors for one-to-four family residential loans include credit unions and mortgage brokers which keep overhead costs and mortgage rates down by selling loans and not holding or servicing them. Our competitors for commercial real estate and multifamily loans include other community banks, commercial lenders and insurance companies, some of which are larger than us and have greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide, along with government agencies such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. We expect competition to remain strong in the future.\nActs of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nFinancial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nClimate change, severe weather, global pandemics, natural disasters, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events, global pandemics, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue, or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nEconomic, social and political conditions or civil unrest in the United States, may affect the markets in which we operate, our customers, our ability to provide customer service, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction in the markets in which we operate, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or man-made disasters, including storm or other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the imposition of related public health measures and travel restrictions, and civil unrest. Such events can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability, result in property damage and business closures within in our markets and increase the volatility of the financial markets. Any of these effects could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations. These events also pose significant risks to the Company\u2019s personnel and to physical facilities, transportation and operations, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is intense, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities in which we may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and Columbia Bank\u2019s depositors.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative changes resulted in broad reform and increased regulation affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate and has restructured the regulation of depository institutions by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated Columbia Bank, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and assigning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies to the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as that which occurred in 2008 and 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nFederal regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan production and losses and other underwriting weaknesses or have compliance weaknesses. These actions include the entering into of formal or informal written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations, and/or they can impose fines. If we were to become subject to a regulatory action, such action could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions. See \u201cItem 1: Business -Regulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulations-Capital Requirements\u201d for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stockholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stockholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or shareholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nChanges to LIBOR may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, our loans, securities and derivatives which are indexed to LIBOR\nWe have loans, securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, authorities announced a plan to extend the date that most U.S. LIBOR values would cease being published from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. The announcement means the continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after June 30, 2023.\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\"), a group of diverse private-market participants assembled by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was tasked with identifying alternative reference interest rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\"SOFR\") has emerged as the ARRC's preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; however, other market alternatives have been developed. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. The use of SOFR continues to steadily grow. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to alternative reference rates as markets continue to transition away from LIBOR.\nThe language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor index to LIBOR would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give us or the calculation agent, as applicable, discretion over the selection of the substitute index for the calculation of interest rates. The implementation of a substitute index or the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements may result in us incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We continue to develop and implement plans to mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR.\nThe implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments became effective for the Company on January 1, 2022. ASU No. 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. This standard requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, compared to the incurred loss model. The adoption of CECL can result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the model, such as the forecasted economic conditions in the foreseeable future and loan payment behaviors. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, can have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17683, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CLBK"}
