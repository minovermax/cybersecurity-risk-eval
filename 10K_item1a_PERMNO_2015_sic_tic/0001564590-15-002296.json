CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY\nThe following factors may affect the growth and profitability of Milestone and should be considered by any prospective purchaser or current holder of Milestone\u2019s securities:\nMilestone does not have a consistent history of profitable operations. Continuing losses could exhaust capital resources and force us to discontinue operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, revenues were approximately $10.3 million and $10 million, respectively. Milestone has a net loss of approximately $1,708,000 for year ended December 31, 2014 and a net profit of approximately $1,465,000 for year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, Milestone has had losses for each year since the commencement of operations with the exception of 2013. Milestone has an accumulated deficit of approximately $62 million. At December 31, 2014, Milestone had cash and cash equivalents, including Treasury Bills of $10,367,993 and working capital of $13,147,257. The working capital increased by $9,223,234 from December 31, 2013. The positive change in working capital is primarily due to the cash proceed from the Private Placement in May 2014 ($10 million). Milestone management continues to examine all areas of the business to manage our cash flow. Milestone is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue based upon management\u2019s assessment of present contracts and current negotiations and reductions in operating expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Milestone believes that it has sufficient cash reserves to meet all of its anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. Milestone will continue to manage its cash position while taking strategic steps to expand its business in the medical and dental, business sectors.\nMilestone cannot become successful unless it gains greater market acceptance for its products and technology.\nAs with any new technology, there is substantial risk that the marketplace will not accept the potential benefits of this technology or be unwilling to pay for any cost differential with the existing technologies. Market acceptance of CompuDent, STA Instrument, the SafetyWand, CompuMed and CompuFlo depends, in large part, upon the ability to educate potential customers of the product\u2019s distinctive characteristics and benefits and will require substantial marketing efforts and expense. More than 41,000 instruments of the STA Instrument and its predecessors have been sold worldwide since 1998. Since being introduced to market in February 2007, more than 13,000 instruments of the STA Instrument have been sold. Milestone cannot assure that its current or\nproposed products will be accepted by practitioners or that any of the current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively against current and alternative products.\nMilestone\u2019s limited distribution channels must be expanded in order to become successful.\nFuture revenues depend on Milestone\u2019s ability to market and distribute its computer-controlled injection products successfully. In November 2012, Milestone signed on an exclusive distributor and marketing company to sell and distribute the STA instruments and handpieces in the USA and Canada. To be successful, Milestone will need to engage additional distributors, provide for their proper training and ensure adequate customer support. Milestone cannot assure that it will be able to hire and retain an adequate sales force or engage suitable distributors, or that the sales force or distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the products.\nIn early October 2012, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People\u2019s Republic of China approved Milestone\u2019s Single Tooth Anesthesia System\u00ae (STA System). In May 2014, the CFDA, (previously the SFDA), granted registration approval of the STA handpieces in China.\nMilestone depends on two principal manufacturers. If Milestone cannot maintain its existing relationships or develop new ones, it may have to cease operations.\nMilestone and its subsidiary has informal arrangements with the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent and CompuMed instruments and with one of the principal manufacturers of the handpieces, for those items, respectively. Pursuant to the informal arrangements, they manufacture these products under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitment. However, in November 2009, Milestone issued a purchase order to Tricor System Inc. to manufacture 12,000 STA Instruments, over the following three years. Milestone has a manufacturing agreement with one of the principal manufacturers, which is a related party, of its handpieces pursuant to which they manufacture products under specific purchase orders but without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone has been supplied by the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent and CompuMed since the commencement of production in 1998, the manufacturer of its handpieces since 2003. However, termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect the ability to produce and sell the products. Though other alternate sources of supply for handpieces exist, Milestone would need to recover its existing tools or have new tools produced to establish relationships with new suppliers. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of the supply, whether or not as a result or termination of the relationship, would have an adverse effect.\nMilestone may be subject to product liability claims that are not fully covered by insurance and that could put Milestone under financial strain.\nMilestone could be subject to claims for personal injury from the alleged malfunction or misuse of the dental and medical products. While Milestone carries liability insurance that is believed to be adequate, Milestone cannot assure that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay such claims should they be successful. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on Milestone.\nMilestone relies on the continuing services of the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.\nMilestone depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Clinical Affairs. Milestone maintains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of $1,000,000 on the life of the Chief Executive Officer. However, the loss of his services or Director of Clinical Affairs, on whom Milestone maintains no insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on the business.\nThe market price of Milestone\u2019s common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone\u2019s control.\nMilestone\u2019s stock price has been extremely volatile, fluctuating during the last two years between $2.45 and $1.00 The market price of common shares could continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which may be beyond Milestone\u2019s control.\nMilestone is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.\nMilestone\u2019s principal shareholders, Leonard Osser, Gian Domenico Trombetta and K. Tucker Andersen, beneficially own 44% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, they have the ability to exercise substantial control over Milestone\u2019s affairs and corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including electing directors, selling all or substantially all of\nthe assets, merging with another entity or amending its certificate of incorporation. This de facto control could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for Milestone\u2019s securities.\nFuture sales or the potential for sale of a substantial number of shares of Milestone\u2019s common stock could cause the trading price of common stock to decline and could impair Milestone\u2019s ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Milestone\u2019s common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of the stock to decline and could materially impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. At December 31, 2014, Milestone had outstanding options to purchase 1,488,796 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $0.36 to $2.23 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $1.33. Holders of these options are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock and are likely to exercise their securities at a time when Milestone would be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Thus, the terms upon which Milestone will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of outstanding options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when Milestone would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than the exercise terms provided by such outstanding securities. The market price of the common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone\u2019s control.\nAdherence to Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be so costly that compliance could have an adverse effect on Milestone.\nThe Management of Milestone has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Milestone complied with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements to include in the annual report a management report on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. In 2005, Milestone hired an outside consultant to assist with the development and implementation of the necessary internal controls and reporting procedures. In 2014 and 2013, Milestone utilized the outside consultant on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting. This expense amounted to $5,250 and $9,500 in 2014 and 2013, respectively and the cost is expected to continue in 2015.", "PERMNO": 82621, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "MLSS"}
