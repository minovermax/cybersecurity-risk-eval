Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the section of this report captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially impacted. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Relating to Our Platform, Products and Technologies\nThe extent and pace of RAIN market adoption is uncertain. If RAIN market adoption does not continue to develop, or develops slower than we expect, our business will suffer.\nThe RAIN market is still developing. RAIN adoption, and adoption of our products and platform, depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which end users understand and embrace the benefits that RAIN offers;\n\u2022\nwhether the benefits of RAIN adoption outweigh the cost and time to replace or modify end users\u2019 existing systems and processes; and\n\u2022\nwhether RAIN products and applications meet end users\u2019 current or anticipated needs.\nIn the past, we have, at times, anticipated and forecasted a pace of end-user adoption that exceeded the actual pace. Additionally, adoption has not progressed evenly for many reasons, such as the project-based nature of many end-user deployments. We expect continued difficulty forecasting the pace of adoption. As a result, we may be unable to accurately forecast our future operating results, including revenue, gross margins, cash flows and profitability, any or all of which could negatively impact our financial performance.\nRAIN adoption is concentrated in key industries, particularly retail. If retailer adoption does not continue at the rate we expect, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance depends on the pace of end-user RAIN adoption in key industries such as retail, our largest market. Retailers with primarily a physical marketplace presence have experienced financial stress in recent periods. Many of these same retailers have deployed RAIN to improve their competitiveness. If they fail to compete effectively then the number of stores they maintain, and the scope of their RAIN deployments, may decrease. Other industries that we currently regard as being key for RAIN adoption include supply chain and logistics, aviation and automotive, many of which face similar stressors as the retail market.\nOur market is very competitive. If we fail to compete successfully then our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe face significant competition from both established and emerging competitors. We believe our principal current competitors are: In endpoint ICs, NXP, Alien, EM Microelectronic and Kiloway; in reader ICs, ST, Phychips, Iotelligent and MagicRF; and in readers and gateways, Alien and Zebra. Our channel partners, including our OEMs, ODMs, distributors, SIs, VARs and software solution partners may choose to compete with us rather than purchase our products, which would not only reduce our customer base but also increase competition in the market, adversely affecting our operating results, business and prospects. Companies in adjacent markets or newly formed companies may decide to enter our market, particularly as RAIN adoption grows. Further, the Chinese government has made development of the Chinese semiconductor industry a priority, potentially increasing competition for us globally while possibly restricting our ability to participate in the Chinese market.\nCompetition for customers is intense. Because the RAIN market is evolving rapidly, winning customer and end-user accounts at an early stage in the development of the market is critical to growing our business. End users that instead use competing products and technologies may face high switching costs, which may affect our and our channel partners\u2019 ability to successfully convert them to our products. Failure to obtain orders from customers and end users, for competitive reasons or otherwise, will materially adversely affect our operating results, business and prospects.\nSome of our competitors may devote more resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors include companies that have much greater financial, operating, research and development, marketing and other resources than us. These competitors may discount their products to gain market share. In doing so, they could simply accept lower margins, or they could maintain margins by achieving cost savings through better, more efficient designs or production methods. They may also bundle other technologies, including those we do not have in our product portfolio, with their RAIN products.\nWe are expected to introduce new products and product enhancements on a regular basis.\nWe introduce new products and services to keep pace with technology advancements, satisfy increasingly demanding end-user requirements and grow market acceptance. We commit significant resources to developing these new products and services while improving performance, reliability and reducing costs. Because our products are often used in, and incorporated into, complex business processes and use cases, new products and services may take time to be successful or may not succeed at all.\nIn the future, our success in developing the technologies or processes necessary for new or enhanced products and services, or in licensing or otherwise acquiring these technologies from third parties, and our ability to introduce new products and services before our competition, will depend on various factors, including:\n\u2022\nour timely and efficient completion of the design process;\n\u2022\nour timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly and testing procedures;\n\u2022\nproduct or service performance;\n\u2022\nproduct certification;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain and manage technical personnel;\n\u2022\nthe quality, reliability and selling price of the product or service; and\n\u2022\neffective marketing, sales and service.\nAn inability or limited ability of enterprise systems to exploit RAIN information may adversely affect the market for our products.\nA successful end-user RAIN deployment requires not only tags and readers or gateways, but RAIN integration with information systems and applications that derive business value from RAIN data. Unless third parties continue developing and advancing business analytics tools, and end users enhance their information systems to use these tools, RAIN deployments could stall. Our efforts to foster third-party development and deployment of these tools could fail. In addition, our guidance to business-analytics providers for integrating our products with their tools could prove ineffective.\nSolution providers and SIs are essential to the RAIN market. They provide deployment know-how to enable end users to successfully deploy RAIN solutions. Integrating our products with end-user information systems could prove more difficult or time consuming than we or they anticipate, which could delay deployments.\nThe selling prices of our products could fluctuate substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\nThe average selling price, or ASP, of our products has historically decreased with time and with RAIN market growth. Although we expect further price decreases in the long term, we raised prices in 2021 to accommodate higher product costs and we cannot predict future pricing trends. Also, from time-to-time we reduce our product prices to meet end-user demands or to respond to market pressure from our competition. We also sometimes reduce prices to encourage adoption, address macroeconomic conditions or for other reasons. If, in the future, we are unable to offset ASP reductions with increased sales volumes or reduced product costs, or if we are unable to successfully increase ASPs to offset cost increases, then our revenue and gross margins will suffer.\nRapid market innovation, which we continue to experience, can drive intense pricing pressure, particularly for older products or products using older technology. New requirements can render older products uncompetitive for new opportunities. In addition, costs for producing older products may stay the same or even increase due to reduced volumes or limited capacity for producing these products. When demand for older products declines, or during times of increased market inventory, ASPs may decline quickly. To sell our products profitably we must continually improve our technology and processes and reduce costs in line with the lower selling prices. If we and our third-party suppliers and manufacturers cannot develop and implement processes or improve efficiencies sufficient to maintain required margins, we may be unable to sell our products profitably.\nWe generate most of our revenue from our endpoint ICs, and a decline in sales of these products or increased price competition in the market for endpoint ICs could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, most of our product revenue from our endpoint ICs. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in endpoint IC demand, wafer supply and wafer prices. If demand declines, or if we are unable to procure enough wafers to meet the demand we do have, or if we are unable to raise prices to accommodate cost increases, then our business and operating results will suffer. In addition, the continued adoption of, and demand for, our existing endpoint ICs, as well as for our new endpoint ICs, derives in part from our ability to continually innovate and to demonstrate the benefits of using our endpoint ICs with our reader ICs, readers and gateways. If we fail to establish the benefits of using our endpoint ICs with our platform, we may not be successful in countering competitive pressures to lower prices for our endpoint ICs and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nChanges in our product mix could adversely affect our overall gross margin.\nWe generate most of our revenue from endpoint IC sales, with lower gross margins than our other products. In addition, endpoint IC gross margins are affected by product mix, which can fluctuate based on competitive pressures and end-user demand. A further shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products to lower margin products, especially to our endpoint ICs, will negatively affect our gross margins.\nOur products must meet demanding technical and quality specifications. Defects, errors or interoperability issues with our products, the failure of our products to operate as expected, or undue difficulty in deploying our products in actual operations could affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products.\nOur products must meet demanding customer specifications for quality, reliability and performance. They are also highly technical and are deployed in large, complex systems. Our partners and end users may discover errors, defects or incompatibilities in our products, including after deploying them. In addition, our partners or end users may find compatibility or interoperability issues between our products and their enterprise software systems, or between our products and other RAIN products. They may also experience problems when our products are combined with or incorporated into products from other vendors, such as our tag OEMs using our endpoint ICs with their antennas, or our reader partners using our reader ICs in their readers. We may have difficulty identifying and correcting the problems when third parties are combining, incorporating or assembling our products.\nIf we are unable to fix errors or other problems, we could experience:\n\u2022\nloss of customers or customer orders;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products;\n\u2022\nloss of market share;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand and reputation;\n\u2022\nimpaired ability to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nincreased service and warranty costs;\n\u2022\nreplacement costs;\n\u2022\nlegal actions by our customers; and\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs.\nCurrently, our products are experiencing production issues, including but not limited to production delays, insufficient production capacity and component shortages. If we are unable to resolve these issues in a timely manner, or at all, then our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWhen we introduce new products, our success in ramping adoption depends, in part, on us making these products easy to deploy by our partners and their end customers. For example, for our new M700 endpoint ICs and E710, E510 and E310 reader ICs, we continue supporting our partners to produce high-performing, high-quality products. Until our partners are able to deploy our products widely, adoption and our operating results could suffer.\nGiven the technical and business requirements against which end users evaluate RAIN and our products and platform, our business results and prospects could suffer if we are unable to make our products and our platform easy to deploy. To demonstrate the benefits of our platform in meeting business needs and to develop deployment methods to meet those needs, we frequently enter into proof-of-concept deployments, or POCs, with prospective end users. These POCs can extend for relatively long periods of time, and they may not be successful for a variety of reasons, including changes in end-user requirements, changes in end-user commitment or deployment challenges.\nEnd users or our direct customers must design our products into their products and systems. If they fail to do so, our operating results and prospects will be adversely affected.\nConvincing end users or our direct customers to design RAIN and our products into their products and systems requires educating them about RAIN\u2019s value over other technologies. They may currently use other technologies or products and may not feel the need to learn about how RAIN or our products can improve their systems. Even when convinced, they often undertake long pilots or qualification processes prior to placing orders. We spend significant time and resources to have RAIN and our products selected by a potential end user or customer. End users or our direct customers adopting RAIN often involves them weighing the benefits of RAIN against the costs of modifying or replacing their existing systems, and if they remain unconvinced, they may not\ndeploy. If we fail to develop new products that adequately or competitively address the needs of end users or our direct customers, they may not select our products to be designed into their systems, which could adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\nOur visibility into the length of the sales and deployment cycles for our products is limited.\nWe have limited visibility into the length of product sales and deployment cycles, and these cycles are often longer than we anticipate. Many factors contribute to our uncertainty, including the time channel partners and end users spend evaluating our products, time educating them on RAIN\u2019s benefits, and time integrating our products with their systems. The length and uncertain timing of the sales and deployment cycles can lead to delayed product orders. In anticipation of those orders, we may incur substantial costs before the sales cycle is complete and before we receive any customer orders or payments, if we receive them at all.\nAlternative technologies, or changes in RAIN standards, may enable competitive products and services and may adversely affect RAIN market growth and our business.\nTechnology developments may affect our business negatively. Breakthroughs in legacy RFID technologies or markets, including those using low frequency or high frequency RFID technology, could adversely affect RAIN market growth generally and demand for our products in particular. Likewise, new technologies may allow lower-cost ICs than our current silicon-based technology allows. If we are unable to innovate using new or enhanced technologies or processes or are slow to react to changes in existing technologies or in the market, or have difficulty competing with advances in new or legacy technologies, then our development of new or enhanced products could be impacted and result in product obsolescence, decreased revenue and reduced market share.\nSignificant changes in RAIN standards bodies, standards or qualification processes could impede our ability to sell our products and services.\nWe participate in developing RAIN industry standards, including with GS1 and ISO, and have designed our products to comply with those standards. We have historically taken a leadership position in standards development. In the future, we could lose that leadership position or our influence in standards development, or we could choose not to participate in certain standards activities.\nNew industry standards, or changes to existing standards, could render our products obsolete and cause us to incur substantial development costs to adapt to the new or changed standards. If the industry standards diverge from our or the RAIN market\u2019s needs, then our products may fail to keep pace with the market or cause end users to delay their deployments. Moreover, the adoption or expected adoption of new or changed standards could slow our sale of existing products before we can introduce new products that meet the new or changed standards. New standards or changes to existing standards could also limit our ability to implement new features in our products if those features do not meet the new or changed standards. The lost opportunities as well as time and expense for us to develop new products or change our existing products to comply with new or changed standards could be substantial, and we may not successfully develop products that comply with new or changed standards.\nCertain organizations develop requirements for RAIN tags and test tags against those requirements. As one example, the ARC Program at Auburn University, or ARC, develops tag performance and quality requirements for end users that engage them. Some participants in the RAIN market are ARC sponsors, but we are not among them. Some other organizations perform this function as well. ARC or a similar organization could develop specifications that few or none of our endpoint ICs meet.\nChanges in government spectrum regulations or their enforcement could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nGovernment radio regulations require that our readers and gateways be certified for spectral compliance in jurisdictions where they are sold or operated. Our readers and gateways are collectively certified for use in more than 40 countries worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea and every country in the EU. If one of our reader or gateway products is found to be noncompliant despite being certified, we could be required to modify field-deployed readers or gateways and could spend significant resources and miss sales opportunities in the process.\nGovernment regulations may change, possibly without notice, requiring us to redesign our products to conform with the new regulations or constraining our ability to incorporate new features into our products. Such\nchanges could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with obsolete inventory. Regulatory changes may also cause us forego opportunities to improve our products, potentially delaying our time-to-market.\nSales of some of our products could cannibalize revenue from other products.\nOur sales of some of our products enable our channel partners to develop their own products that compete with other of our products. For example, sales of our reader ICs allow our OEM partners to build and sell readers and gateways that may compete with our readers and gateways. Similarly, sales of our readers allow our channel partners to build and sell gateways that compete with our xArray and xSpan. In the future, we may see one product line expand at the expense of another, or we may be asked by partners to disadvantage or divest a product line. We cannot predict whether we can manage such conflicts in the future or retain channel partners despite conflicts.\nPricing commitments and other restrictive provisions in our customer agreements could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements containing pricing terms that could, in some instances, adversely affect our operating results and gross margins. For example, some contracts specify future IC, reader or gateway pricing or contain most-favored customer pricing for certain products. Other agreements contain exclusivity terms that prevent us from pursuing certain business with other customers during the exclusivity period. Reducing prices or offering favorable terms to one customer could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other customers.\nRisks Relating to Our Personnel and Business Operations\nWe obtain the products we sell through third parties with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationships with suppliers, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to secure cost-effective, quality products in a timely manner could be adversely affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nThird-party manufacturing capacity may not be available when we need it.\n\u2022\nSome products have long lead times and we place orders for them five or more months before our anticipated delivery dates to our customers. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventory.\n\u2022\nSupply disruptions may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demand, potentially causing customers to cancel orders, qualify alternative suppliers or purchase from our competitors. Supply disruptions can also distort demand, making it even harder to meet true demand with finished products.\nIf our suppliers fail to manufacture our products at reasonable prices or with satisfactory quality levels, then our ability to bring those products to market and our reputation could both suffer. If supplier capacity diminishes, whether from closures, bankruptcy, capacity allocation, in response to Covid-19, catastrophic loss of facilities or otherwise, we could have difficulty fulfilling orders, our revenue could decline and our growth prospects could be impaired. Transitioning our assembly services or IC foundries to new providers would take many months and, in the case of ICs, could take several years. And transition would require a requalification by our customers or end users, which could also adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our operating results. Moreover, in the event of a quality issue, the process of testing failed products and diagnosing and fixing defects is time consuming and costly and could constrain our ability to supply customers with new products.\nShortages of silicon wafers and components used in our readers and gateways may adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and adversely affect our revenues and/or gross margins.\nThe semiconductor industry has experienced periods of capacity shortfall. Many industries, ours included, are experiencing such a shortfall in 2021 and 2022, due to significant worldwide semiconductor demand and limited foundry supply. We exited fourth-quarter 2021 with limited semiconductor inventory and tight foundry supply for both our 200mm and 300mm products, and our foundry partner has signaled tight wafer availability, at least in the older-generation semiconductor nodes that we use, well into 2022. They have also raised prices. Absent a significantly higher wafer allocation in 2022 over 2021, and without the benefit of the wafer inventory buffer we had entering 2021, we will be unable to meet 2022 endpoint IC demand, potentially by a significant amount. capacity, and total unit volumes in light of anticipated strong endpoint IC demand against that constrained wafer supply. We have wafer supply commitments similar to fourth-quarter levels through at least mid-2022, but our supply in subsequent periods is less certain. Wafer shortfalls may decrease sales and cause market-share losses if we are unable to supply enough products and/or our customers purchase competing products or, alternatively, may artificially increase sales as customers overbuy our products, followed by sales declines in future periods as they consume their accumulated inventory. Additionally, if we are unable to raise our prices to cover our higher costs, our gross margins and other financial results could suffer.\nWe have also experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, shortages and price increases for components we use in readers and gateways, potentially impacting future product availability and/or costs. If we are unable to increase our prices to cover our increased costs, our gross margins and other financial results could suffer.\nAt times, our suppliers ask us to purchase excess products to ensure we do not face a subsequent shortage. For example, in certain quarters of 2014, 2015 and 2016, we purchased more endpoint IC wafers than we needed, which reduced our available cash. In addition, we may invest in inventory to support anticipated business growth, as we did with endpoint IC inventory in 2017 and 2020. If we are unable to sell the inventory we purchased, or if we must sell it at lower prices due to excess inventory or obsolescence, then our business will be negatively impacted.\nWe bear inventory risks due to our reliance on channel partners to sell and distribute our products.\nWe typically manufacture our products based on channel-partner forecasts before we receive purchase orders. However, many of our channel partners have difficulty accurately forecasting end-user demand and the timing of that demand. They also sometimes cancel purchase orders or reschedule product shipments, in some cases with little or no advance notice to us. We also sometimes receive soft commitments for large orders which do not materialize. In addition, when we introduce new products, we may initially carry higher inventory or have slower inventory turns depending on market acceptance. We have additional uncertainty arising from our competition\u2019s business practices and from unanticipated external events, such as changes in regulatory standards, all of which can adversely affect demand and consequently our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nCovid-19 has adversely affected our business, and the magnitude and duration of future Covid-19 effects on our business are uncertain.\nCovid-19 has created significant worldwide economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, and those effects are likely to persist for some time. Covid-19 has already, and will likely continue to, adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and future business prospects. Our significant Covid-19 risks include:\n\u2022\nuncertain product demand given the decline and subsequent rebound, the latter at least partial, in many business activities globally, particularly in the retail industry, as well as overall delays in RAIN market adoption;\n\u2022\ndecreased visibility into market demand and consequent challenges in effectively managing our inventory;\n\u2022\npartner-requested preordering or rescheduling as a result of supply concerns which can distort channel inventory, either positively or negatively;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs such as those associated with work-from-home or restricted-movement edicts, increased legal and regulatory demands, and increase product costs due to component or production shortfalls;\n\u2022\nproduct delays or shortages due to restrictions on our ability, or that of our suppliers, to operate at normal capacity due to personnel movement restrictions or other limitations;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer pilots which can delay project-based deployments;\n\u2022\ndelays in research and development efforts which can, in turn, delay new product introductions or product enhancements;\n\u2022\ninability to engage in in-person sales and market activities, which can reduce our ability to effectively sell our products and drive future demand;\n\u2022\ncost-reduction initiatives, such as lay-offs and furloughs; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee engagement and productivity in a prolonged work-from-home environment.\nWith respect to market demand, in 2020, Covid-19 caused widespread venue closures, materially affecting demand for our products. Covid-19 continued impacting venues in 2021, with an adverse impact in retail, including retail apparel, where RAIN is widely adopted, and likely will continue to have impacts on venues and retailers in 2022. Covid-19 may accelerate a long-term shift in consumer behavior away from physical stores which may further reduce demand for our products over the longer term. The extent and duration to which Covid-19 impacts the retail industry and any retailer\u2019s plans with respect to capital expenditures is unclear, as is the extent to which it will impact our product sales.\nCovid-19 has affected many other markets that use our products, including aviation, sporting events such as footraces, and many others. Many of these markets continued to feel Covid-19\u2019s impacts in 2021 and may continue to feel these impacts in 2022. If we fail to make our products and platform easy-to-deploy and economical for these markets, or if participants in these markets delay or forgo RAIN investments in response to Covid-19 or otherwise, our ability to penetrate them may suffer.\nUncertainties surrounding global trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the jurisdictions where we currently develop and sell products, and any negative consequences resulting from such changes, could materially affect our business.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has imposed significant tariffs on a variety of items imported other countries, particularly China. China has responded by imposing significant tariffs on a variety of items imported from the United States. Such tariffs could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete internationally. Although the United States and China signed a preliminary trade agreement in early 2020, the tariffs remain in place as negotiations between the countries continue.\nOther causes of uncertainty include the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to promote China\u2019s domestic semiconductor industry and lingering uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom\u2019s separation from the EU.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in operating abroad and may not be able to successfully maintain or expand our international operations.\nIn 2021, we derived 83% of our total revenue from sales outside the United States. We anticipate growing our business, in part, by continuing to expand our international operations, which has a variety of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges, some unexpected or unanticipated, in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nlack of established, clear, or fairly implemented standards or regulations with which our products must comply;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, judgments and arbitration awards in international courts, and in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment and collection periods;\n\u2022\nlimited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ninflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions, or changes thereof, on foreign trade or investment, including currency-exchange controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions, including, for example, global and regional economic disruptions caused by Covid-19;\n\u2022\npolitical uncertainty, strife, unrest, or conflict, including, for example, the United Kingdom\u2019s 2021 departure from the EU and China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulations with regard to maintaining operations, products and public information;\n\u2022\ninequities or difficulties obtaining or maintaining export and import licenses;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations, including where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees than in the United States;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on earnings repatriation;\n\u2022\ncorrupt or unethical practices in foreign jurisdictions that may subject us to exposure under applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, or U.K. Bribery Act; and\n\u2022\nregulations, and changes thereof, relating to data privacy, cybersecurity, and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in Europe.\nVarious foreign regulatory or governmental bodies may issue rulings that invalidate prior laws, regulations, or legal frameworks in ways that may adversely impact our business. For example, the European Union Court of Justice in October 2015 invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework, which facilitated personal data transfers to the United States in compliance with applicable EU data-protection laws. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, subsequently adopted in 2016 to provide a mechanism for companies to transfer EU personal data to the United States, was also invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice in July 2020. As another example, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes more stringent data-protection requirements than the former regulatory regime in the EU and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue or \u20ac20 million. Significant regulatory uncertainty remains surrounding data transfers from the European Economic Area to the United States. In China, we are monitoring legal and government advisory developments regarding cybersecurity-focused legislation for impacts to our business related to cross-border transfer limitations and evolving privacy, security, or data protection requirements. We may be required to change our policies and practices with respect to data transfer and other aspects of our data processing and security, which may be burdensome or involve substantial cost and expense, in an effort to address new and evolving limitations and requirements relating to privacy, security, data storage and data protection.\nThe United Kingdom, or UK, has enacted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and which provides for penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue and \u00a317.5 million. Following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, however, which became effective January 31, 2020, with a transition period ending December 31, 2020, significant uncertainty remains regarding matters such as data transfers between the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions. This uncertainty and other developments could require us to further change the way we conduct our business and transmit data between the U.S., the UK, the EU, and the rest of the world. Likewise, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for certain data of California residents and provides for noncompliance penalties of up to $7,500 per violation. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by voters in California\u2019s November 2020 election. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, creating additional obligations with respect to consumer data commencing on January 1, 2022, and going into effect generally on January 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA, the GDPR and other laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and security remain unclear as of the date of this report, but these laws and regulations potentially are far reaching. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and security, and continued evolution of such laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement, may require us to modify our practices and policies, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and otherwise cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply\nwith these laws and regulations may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, legal and other costs, substantial time and resources and fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such actions may be expensive to defend, may incur substantial legal and other costs and substantial time and resources and likely would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe opened an office in Shanghai, China in 2011. In addition to the risks listed above, our China operations expose us to risks associated with Chinese laws and policies governing Chinese operations and also to U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment. To date, legal, policy or regulatory changes have not had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, but they may in the future. We may experience increased costs for, or significant impact to, our Chinese operations in the event of changes in Chinese government policies or political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. The nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises by the Chinese government could result in total loss of our China investment. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws related to our foreign activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees and intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, securing an advantage or directing business to another person, and require companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, our intermediaries or our solution providers, SIs, OEMs, ODMs, VARs, distributors, tag manufacturers or other partners fail to comply with FCPA or similar legislation, government authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, China is an area of heightened exposure regarding compliance with anticorruption laws such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. We intend to increase our international sales and business in China and, as such, our risk of violating laws such as the FCPA or U.K. Bribery Act also increases.\nWe generally conduct our China operations through a wholly owned subsidiary and our European operations through our U.K. subsidiary. For other worldwide jurisdictions, we generally report our taxable income based on our business operations in those jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to the jurisdiction or subsidiary. In the event of a disagreement, if our position is not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability.\nWe have added engineering personnel in South America and are expanding our operations team in Southeast Asia, each through subsidiaries in these jurisdictions. Expanding our presence in this way increases our exposure to risks inherent in operating globally.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of certain products, technologies and software. We must export our products in compliance with U.S. export controls, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. We may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses, and our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or limitations on our ability to export or sell our products imposed by these laws may harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue. Noncompliance with these laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nChanges in our products or changes in export, import and economic sanctions laws and regulations may delay us introducing new products in international markets, prevent our customers from using our products internationally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to or from certain countries altogether. The U.S. government has imposed significant tariffs on a variety of items imported from China. China has responded by imposing significant tariffs on a variety of items imported from the United States. Such tariffs could have a material impact on our product costs and decrease our ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers and harm our ability to compete internationally. Further, it is possible that additional sanctions\nor restrictions may be imposed by the U.S. government on items imported into the United States from China and any such measures could further adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers and harm our ability to compete internationally. Any change in export or import regulations or legislation; shift or change in enforcement; or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations, adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nInstability or deterioration in the political, social, business or economic conditions in key production jurisdictions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe outsource our manufacturing and production to suppliers in a small number of jurisdictions including Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and China. These jurisdictions have experienced significant changes in political, social, business or economic conditions in the past and may experience them in the future. Some of these jurisdictions have also experienced, and may continue to experience, intermittent or sustained mandatory shutdowns or other restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19.\nDeterioration in the political, social, business or economic conditions in any jurisdictions in which we have significant suppliers could slow or halt product shipments or disrupt our ability to manufacture, test or post-process products. In response, we could be forced to transfer our manufacturing, testing and post-processing activities to more stable, and potentially more costly, regions or find alternative suppliers.\nIn particular, we source a significant portion of our wafers from suppliers in Taiwan, and our supply of wafers and other critical components may be materially and adversely affected by diplomatic, geopolitical and other developments affecting the relationship between China and Taiwan. Since 1949, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have been separately governed. The government of the People\u2019s Republic of China claims that it is the only legitimate government in China, including Taiwan and mainland China, and that Taiwan is part of China. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established between Taiwan and mainland China in the past few years, the People\u2019s Republic of China has refused to renounce the use of military force to gain control over Taiwan, there can be no assurances that relations between Taiwan and mainland China will not deteriorate, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between China, the United States and Taiwan. Any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations could be disrupted by natural disasters.\nIn addition to the pandemic risk discussed earlier under \u201c-Covid-19 has adversely affected our business, and the magnitude and duration of future Covid-19 effects on our business are uncertain,\u201d other disasters, whether natural or manmade, could decrease demand for our products, disable our facilities, disrupt operations or cause catastrophic losses. We have facilities in areas with known seismic activity, such as our headquarters in Seattle, Washington. We have facilities in areas with known flooding, such as our office in Shanghai, China. We have a wafer testing and dicing subcontractor in Thailand, a region with a known, and recent, history of flooding. A loss at any of these or other of our or our suppliers\u2019 facilities could disrupt operations, delay production and shipments, reduce revenue and engender potentially large expenses to repair or replace the facility. We do not carry insurance that covers potential losses caused by pandemics, earthquakes, floods or other disasters.\nRisks Relating to Our Relationships with Customers, Channel Partners and End Users\nWe rely on a small number of customers for a large share of our revenues.\nWe sell our endpoint ICs directly to inlay and tag OEMs and ODMs. We sell our reader ICs to OEMs and ODMs, primarily through distribution. We sell our readers and gateways to VARs and SIs, primarily through distribution. In 2021, sales to tag OEMs Avery Dennison and Arizon accounted for 32% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively. In March 2020, Avery Dennison acquired Smartrac\u2019s RFID inlay segment. Sales concentration to a smaller number of OEMs decreases our bargaining power and increases the risk that our pricing or sales could decline based on sales measures taken by our competitors or our own failure to compete effectively.\nIf we fail to retain our endpoint IC, reader IC, reader or gateway partners or distributors or fail to establish new relationships, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed. Our competitors\u2019 relationships with, or acquisitions of, these partners or distributors could interfere with our relationships with them. Any such interference could impair or delay our product sales or increase our cost of sales.\nWe engage directly with end users to adopt our products in large projects. These projects, often involving large purchases of our readers and gateways, are often discrete deployments that can result in significant sales for periods of time. They also increase the volatility of our revenues and operating results. If we are unable to replace project-based revenue with new revenue streams, or if end users with large projects change or delay them without giving us with adequate notice, our sales could decline from period to period and harm our stock price.\nBecause we sell and fulfill through channel partners, our ability to affect or determine end-user demand is limited.\nEnd users drive demand for our products but, because we sell our products primarily through channel partners, we are one step removed from those end users and often unable to directly assess their demand. Our channel partners may choose to prioritize selling our competitors\u2019 products over ours, or they may offer products that compete with our products or limit sales of our products. If our channel partners do not sell enough of our products or if they choose to decrease their inventories of our products for any reason, our sales to these channel partners and our revenue will decline.\nOur channel partners may not properly forecast end users\u2019 demand for our products.\nOur channel partners may purchase more of our products than they need to satisfy end-user demand, increasing their inventory and reducing future sales. Distributors may return products in exchange for other products, subject to time and quantity limitations. Our reserve estimates for products stocked by our distributors are based principally on reports provided to us by our distributors, typically on a monthly basis. If the inventory and resale information our partners and distributors provide is inaccurate, or if we do not receive it in a timely manner, then we may not have a reliable view of products being sold to end users which could impact our operating results.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on the success of strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance and alignment.\nWe invest in relationships with SIs, VARs and software providers whose product offerings complement ours and through which we fulfill our product sales. Our business will be harmed if we fail to develop and grow these partner relationships. For example, our operating results may suffer if our efforts developing partner relationships increase costs but do not increase revenue. Partner relationships may also involve exclusivity provisions, multiple levels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. The cost of developing and maintaining partner relationships may go unrecovered and our efforts may not generate a corresponding increase in revenue.\nOur business depends on our brand recognition and reputation, and if we fail to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation then our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that building our brand and reputation is key to our relationships with partners and end users and to our ability to attract new partners and end users. We also believe that our brand and reputation will be increasingly important as market competition increases. Our success depends on a range of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to deliver high-quality, innovative and defect-free products;\n\u2022\nmaintaining high customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully differentiating our products from those of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nappropriately managing both positive and negative publicity.\nProduct supply shortages have challenged our ability to meet customer needs and we have recently increased prices in response to our suppliers increasing their prices to us. Our inability to supply customers with products they need, and/or our need to increase our prices could result in long-lasting, negative consequences to our relationships with customers, to RAIN adoption and to our business overall.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, then our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or circumventing those rights. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents in the United States and copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and foreign countries. We have historically focused on filing U.S. patent applications for a number of reasons including the fact that many RAIN products are used in or imported into the United States. By seeking patent protection primarily in the United States, our ability to assert our intellectual property rights outside the United States is limited, including in some significant foreign markets such as China. We have registered trademarks and domain names in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate and we have a small number of foreign patent applications and issued and allowed foreign patents. Regardless, some of our products and technologies may not be adequately protected by any patent, patent application, trademark, copyright, trade secret or domain name. Also, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the United States.\nWe cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022\nany of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage we originally sought;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights can or will be enforced, particularly in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protections may be weak;\n\u2022\nwe will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against, or to license our technology to, others and collect royalties or other payments; or\n\u2022\nwe will retain the right to ask for a royalty-bearing license to an industry standard if we fail to file an intellectual property declaration pursuant to the standards process.\nMonitoring and addressing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property has already occurred and may occur again. Our failure to identify unauthorized use or otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nLitigation to enforce our intellectual property rights is time consuming, distracting, expensive and could result in outcomes or consequences that are harmful to us. We could incur significant costs and divert our attention and the attention of our employees by threatening or initiating litigation, which could, in turn, decrease revenue and increase expenses. Because litigation outcomes are uncertain, we could lose an enforcement action or weaken our intellectual property rights in litigation. An adverse decision could impair our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. At the same time, a decision not to enforce our intellectual property rights could embolden others to violate or potentially violate our intellectual property rights and thus weaken those rights over time.\nOn June 6, 2019, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against NXP USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of NXP Semiconductors N.V., or NXP, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, or the Court. For further information regarding this litigation, please refer to Note 11 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIf we are unsuccessful in prosecuting our patent-infringement claims against NXP or in defending ourselves against NXP\u2019s counterclaims, or to the extent we cannot maintain the validity and enforceability of our patents, we could see a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, our lawsuit against NXP will increase our expenses and distract management and key employees, and could negatively impact our relationships with partners or end users and result in retaliatory claims against us.\nSome of our technology is not patented or patentable and constitutes trade secrets. To protect our trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, advisors and other collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We also rely on contractual protections with our channel partners, suppliers and end users, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information. We cannot guarantee we have entered into appropriate agreements with all parties that have access to our trade secrets or confidential information. Moreover, the agreements we have entered into may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Our trade secrets and other confidential information could also be obtained by third parties by breaches of our security systems. Our suppliers, employees or consultants could also assert rights to our trade secrets or other confidential information.\nOur use of overseas manufacturers has extra risk. The intellectual property protection in countries where our third-party contractors operate is weaker than in the United States. If the steps we have taken and the protection provided by law do not adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights, then we could suffer lost profits due to sales of competing products that exploit our intellectual property rights.\nWe may become party to intellectual property disputes which could be time consuming, costly to prosecute, defend or settle, result in the loss of significant rights, and adversely affect RAIN adoption generally.\nMany companies in our industry, as well as non-practicing entities, hold patents and other intellectual property rights and may pursue, protect and enforce those intellectual property rights. We have received, and may receive in the future, invitations to license patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that could be important to our business. We also receive assertions against us, our channel partners and or end users claiming that we or they infringe patent or other intellectual property rights. Offers to purchase patents or other intellectual property rights, or claims that we infringe patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, are costly to resolve and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If we decline to accept an offer or refute a claim, then the offering or claiming party may pursue litigation against us.\nIntellectual property disputes have adversely affected RAIN adoption. As one example, in 2011 Round Rock Research filed lawsuits against 11 end users, including Walmart and Macy\u2019s, for RAIN-related patent infringement. We believe those lawsuits adversely affected demand for our products from 2011 to 2014. In 2013, Round Rock Research entered into licensing agreements with many RAIN suppliers, including us; in early 2015 they reached a settlement agreement with the last of the end-user defendants. The licensed Round Rock patents all expired by the end of 2019. However, we, our channel partners, suppliers or end users could be involved in similar disputes in the future which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe may be forced, or choose, to take action to protect our own intellectual property against infringement by others. Our actions could adversely affect RAIN adoption as well as our own operating and growth prospects. For example, in June 2019 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against NXP USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of NXP, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and in October 2019, NXP USA, Inc. and NXP filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. For more information, see \u201c-If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\u201d\nMany of our agreements require us to indemnify and defend our channel partners and end users from third-party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. These damages could be sizable and disproportionate to the business we derive from the accused channel partners or end users. Moreover, we may not know whether we are infringing a third party\u2019s rights due to the large number of RAIN-related patents or to other systemic factors. For example, patent applications in the United States are maintained in confidence for up to 18 months after filing or, in some instances, for the entire time prior to patent issuance. Consequently, we may not be able to account for such rights until after a patent issues.\nCompetitors may file patent applications or receive patents that block or compete with our patents. Claims of this sort can harm our relationships with our channel partners or end users and may deter these partners or end users from doing business with us. Further, we may or may not prevail in patent-related proceedings given the complexity and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, then we could be required to:\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u2022\npay substantial damages to our channel partners or end users to cause them to discontinue their use of, or replace, infringing products with non-infringing products.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntellectual property licensing from or to others, including competitors, may subject us to requirements or limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nVarious intellectual-property license agreements give us access to the patents and intellectual property of others, for example to necessary intellectual property in GS1 EPCglobal protocols and ISO standards. We have similarly licensed some of our patents and intellectual property to others, for example pursuant to agreements in connection with us participating in developing GS1 EPCglobal protocols and ISO standards.\nFor the former, in the course of us participating in developing GS1 EPCglobal UHF Gen2, UHF Gen2 V2, tag data standards, low-level reader protocol and other protocols, we agreed to license on a royalty-free basis those of our patents that are necessarily infringed by the practice of these protocols to other GS1 EPCglobal members, subject to reciprocal royalty-free rights from those other members. For the latter, in the course of us participating in developing ISO standards, we agreed to license on a RAND basis those of our patents that are necessarily infringed by the practice of those ISO standards, again subject to reciprocal royalty-free rights from the other ISO members.\nBecause it may not be clear whether a member\u2019s intellectual property is necessary to the practice of current or future protocols or standards, disputes could arise among members, resulting in our inability to receive a license on royalty-free or RAND terms or to assert our not-necessary patents against others. Further, some GS1 EPCglobal members declined to license their intellectual property on royalty-free terms, instead demanding reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or RAND, terms. Disputes or confusion may arise about whether we may invoke our necessary intellectual property if those members choose to assert their RAND intellectual property, potentially causing or at least complicating any ensuing litigation and harming our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the course of us participating in ISO, we may be required to grant to all users worldwide a license to those of our patents that are necessarily infringed by the practice of other standards, including at frequencies other than UHF, on RAND terms, again subject to reciprocity. As a result, we are not always able to limit to whom and, to a certain extent, on what terms we license our technologies, and our control over and our ability to generate licensing revenue from some of our patents may be limited. We may also choose to license our patents or intellectual property to others in the future. We cannot guarantee that any patents and technology that we provide in any will not be used against us.\nWe rely on third-party license agreements; impairment of those agreements may cause production or shipment delays that could harm our business.\nWe have license agreements with third parties for patents, software and technology we use in our operations and in our products. For example, we license tools from design-automation software vendors to design our silicon products. Third-party licenses for patents, software and other technology important to our business may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Loss of any such licenses could cause manufacturing interruptions or delays or reductions in product shipments until we can develop, license, integrate, and deploy alternative technologies, if even possible, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur use of open-source software may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes use or incorporate software that is subject to an open-source license. Open-source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable, and is made available to the general public on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis under the terms of a nonnegotiable license. Use and distribution of open-source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software. Certain open-source software\nlicenses require a user who intends to distribute the open-source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the user\u2019s source code. In addition, certain open-source software licenses require the user of such software to make derivative works of the open-source code available to others at low or no cost. Consequently, open-source licensing can subject our previously proprietary software to open-source licensing terms, which could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales. In addition, open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of their code, opening us to business risks that could materially harm our operating results.\nWe may face claims alleging noncompliance with open-source license terms or infringement or misappropriation of proprietary software. These claims could result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license, or require us to devote research and development resources to change our software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. Few courts have interpreted open-source licenses, and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our offerings. In addition, if there are changes in the licensing terms for the open-source software we use, we may be forced to re-engineer our solutions, incur additional costs or discontinue the sale of our products. We cannot guarantee that we have incorporated all open-source software in a manner that is consistent with our current policies and procedures, or in a manner that will not subject us to liability.\nRisks Relating to Privacy and Cybersecurity\nPrivacy and security concerns relating to RAIN could damage our reputation and deter current or potential customers from using our products.\nPrivacy advocates and others have raised and may continue raising concerns about RAIN compromising consumer privacy or facilitating theft. These concerns include unauthorized parties potentially collecting personally identifiable information or personal data, tracking consumers, stealing identities or causing other issues relating to privacy or data protection. If such concerns increase, or if actual malicious or inadvertent breaches of privacy or theft occur or are perceived to have occurred, then our reputation could be damaged, our business and prospects may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. We may be or be alleged to be subject to contractual or self-regulatory obligations, in addition to legal and regulatory obligations, relating to privacy, data protection and security with respect to RAIN. These actual or asserted obligations may require us to modify our practices and policies, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and otherwise cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with any laws, regulations, or contractual or other obligations to which we are or may be asserted to be subject may result in regulatory actions, private claims and litigation, legal and other costs, substantial time and resources and fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such actions may be expensive to defend, may entail substantial legal and other costs as well as time and resources and likely would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to concerns over privacy or theft, it is possible for those with malicious intent to misuse RAIN to facilitate theft or damage the public trust. If a theft or other damaging incident occurs or is perceived to occur and customer or end-user data, personally identifiable information or other confidential information is accessed or used without authorization, then our and our customers\u2019 operations could be disrupted and our customers or we could be the target of regulatory investigations or proceedings and private claims, demands or litigation, and we could face potential liability and significant costs and expenses to remediate and otherwise respond to the incident. Concerns about security and privacy, even if unfounded, could also damage our reputation and operating results or could delay overall RAIN industry development. In such an event, our business and prospects may suffer, and we could incur claims, proceedings and significant liability. We also could be required to expend significant capital and resources to address any security incident or breach and to implement measures to prevent further breaches or incidents.\nWe cannot ensure that any limitation-of-liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts are enforceable or adequate or would protect us from any liabilities or damages against claims relating to a security breach or other security-related matter.\nGovernment regulations and guidelines and other standards relating to consumer privacy may adversely impact adoption of our products, require us to make design changes or constrain our ability to implement new and desired product features.\nOur customers are subject to laws and regulations related to collecting, storing, transmitting and using personal information and personal data, as well as additional laws and regulations that address privacy and security related to RFID in general. Because RAIN is a type of RFID, we believe these laws and regulations apply to RAIN.\nThe European Commission, or the EC, has issued guidance to address privacy concerns about RFID. In May 2009, the EC issued a recommendation that retailers in the EU inform their customers when RFID tags are either on or embedded within products. In April 2011, the EC signed a voluntary agreement with private and public entities to develop privacy guidelines for companies using RFID in the EU. While compliance with the guidelines is voluntary, our customers that do business in the EU prefer products that comply with the guidelines. If our RAIN products do not provide the necessary functionality to allow customers to comply with the guidelines then our business may suffer.\nThe data-security and privacy legislative and regulatory landscape in the United States, EU and other foreign jurisdictions continues to evolve, and new or changed laws, regulations, guidelines and standards may adversely impact our business, including our ability to develop future products. If we fail to develop products that meet end-user privacy requirements, then end users may choose not to use our products.\nAlthough the Gen2 V2 protocol includes features for addressing consumer privacy and authenticating a tag, and although we have incorporated custom features in our products to further protect consumer privacy, a third party may still breach these features, including as implemented in our products, in which case our reputation could be damaged and our business and prospects could suffer.\nA breach of security or other security incidents impacting our systems or others used in our business could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe use security systems to maintain our facility\u2019s physical and information-technology security and to protect our proprietary and confidential information, including that of our customers, suppliers and employees. We face risks of security breaches and incidents from a variety of sources, including viruses, ransomware, hacking, malicious code, and social engineering and other forms of employee or contractor negligence, unintentional acts, or malfeasance. Accidental or willful security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems could compromise access to and the integrity of this information. The consequences of loss and possible misuse of our proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to individuals, could include, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty marketing or selling our products, customer allegations of breach of contract, loss or theft of intellectual property, claims and litigation, governmental and regulatory proceedings, and possible fines, penalties and other damages and liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and relationships with customers and partners.\nWe rely on third-party providers of corporate infrastructure services such as for human resources, electronic communications and financial functions. Additionally, our platform operates in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products, services, and components. Consequently, we depend on the security systems of these third-party providers. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers\u2019 systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our platform. These third-party providers also face risks of security breaches or incidents, and our ability to monitor their security is limited. Any security breaches, incidents or other unauthorized access to our service-providers\u2019 systems or viruses, loggers, ransomware or other errors, vulnerabilities, or malfeasant code in their data or software could expose us to loss, unavailability, or misappropriation of, or unauthorized use or disclosure of, confidential and proprietary information. If there is a security vulnerability, error, ransomware or other bug or malfeasant code in one of these third-party products, services and components and if there is a security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation or competitive position. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage security systems change frequently and are often not recognized until after an attack, we may be unable to anticipate the techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, thereby exposing us to material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. We use SolarWinds products, including those compromised by the security breach SolarWinds announced on December 14, 2020. We applied the recommended security patches provided by SolarWinds and we do not believe our system was compromised. Using third-party providers introduces risk of a cybersecurity incident.\nWe may incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents. In the event of an actual or perceived security breach or incident, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate, notify third parties of, and otherwise address, the breach or incident and its root cause and to take steps to prevent further breaches or incidents. Claims relating to an actual or perceived security breach or incident may not be adequately covered by our insurance and may result in increased insurance costs or insurance not being available to us at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have a history of losses and have only achieved profitability intermittently. We cannot be certain that we will attain or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in 2000. Whereas we were profitable between 2013 and 2015, we had a net loss of $51.3 million for the year ended, and an accumulated deficit of $362.5 million as of, December 31, 2021. Our ability to attain or sustain profitability depends on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control, including continued RAIN adoption and us maintaining or growing our market share. We expect significant expenses to support operations, product development and business and headcount expansion in sales, engineering, and marketing and may, for periods of time, choose to invest to grow the market and our share, reduce costs, improve our efficiencies or shorten our supply chain. If we fail to increase our revenue or manage our expenses, or if our investments in growing the market or our market share do not succeed, then we may not attain or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have a history of significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results.\nYou should consider our business and its prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in the uncertain and rapidly evolving RAIN market. Because this market is new, large and evolving, predicting its growth rate and ultimate size is difficult. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we sell our products, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, reduce our ability to accurately gauge our future prospects and forecast our quarterly or annual performance. If sales exceed expectations or if we reduce prices to win a large opportunity or in response to competition, then our revenue and profitability may be positively affected, but gross margins may be negatively affected. If we are unable to obtain semiconductor wafers or electronic components, then our sales will decline and our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected. If research analysts or investors view our decisions negatively, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nHistorically, our success predicting future sales of our products and platform has been limited. End users drive demand for our products, but we sell nearly all our products through channel partners so our ability to forecast end-user demand is limited. We rely on those same channel partners to integrate our products with end-\nuser information systems and this integration has been uneven and unpredictable in scope, timing and implementation. Also, RAIN-based systems often require time-consuming proofs-of-concepts and other steps such as designing and implementing new business processes, which make sales of our products difficult to forecast. Partly as a consequence, in the past, both we and other industry participants have at times overestimated the RAIN market size and growth rates, then failed to meet expectations.\nOur history shows sales volatility and highlights our limited ability to forecast sales. For example, in 2016 our endpoint IC sales exceeded both our expectations and those of our industry\u2019s analysts due in large part to several coincident large end-user deployments. Then, in the latter part of 2017 and in early 2018, the pace of endpoint IC unit-volume growth slowed relative to 2016, we believe due to multiple factors including, but not limited to, delays in new deployments and in planned expansions at several large retailers as well as a correction in our endpoint IC channel inventory. Then, in the latter part of 2018 and in 2019, due to shorter lead times for our endpoint ICs, we were increasingly receiving orders and shipping the ordered products within the same quarter. Those shortened lead times decreased our ability to predict both optimal inventory and order volume for a quarter. Then, in early 2020, Covid-19 introduced even greater uncertainty in our business, with us choosing to build product inventory during the pandemic-induced downturn. In 2021 we saw strong demand in excess of our available product supply, and we expect that these conditions will continue into 2022. We currently have endpoint IC supply commitments that will allow us to equal or exceed fourth-quarter 2021 shipment levels through mid-2022, but the adequacy of our supply beyond mid-2022 remains uncertain.\nWe expect that for the foreseeable future our visibility to future sales, including volumes and prices, will continue to be limited. Our poor visibility may cause fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, in our actual operating results and in differences between our expected and actual operating results.\nMany factors, most of which are outside our control, may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. These fluctuations make financial planning and forecasting difficult. In addition, these fluctuations may cause unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. Material factors that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenue include:\n\u2022\nthe impact of Covid-19 on macroeconomic conditions, our business and our customers, end-users, suppliers and other business partners;\n\u2022\nvariations in RAIN adoption and deployment delays by end users;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products or platform, including by tag manufacturers and other significant customers on which we rely for a substantial portion of our revenue;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the availability or supply of our products;\n\u2022\nvariations in the quality of our products and return rates;\n\u2022\ndelays in new-product introductions and in the maturity of our new-product technologies;\n\u2022\ndecreases in selling prices for our products;\n\u2022\ndelays in our product-shipment timing, customer or end-user sales or deployment cycles, or work performed under development contracts;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes involving us, our customers, end users or other participants in our industry;\n\u2022\nadverse outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings;\n\u2022\ntiming variability in product introductions, enhancements, services, and technologies by us and our competitors and market acceptance of these new or enhanced products, services and technologies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated excess or obsolete inventory as a result of supply-chain mismanagement, new-product introduction, quality issues or otherwise;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amount and timing of our operating costs, including those related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nchanges in business cycles or seasonal fluctuations that may affect the markets in which we sell;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry standards or specifications, or changes in government regulations, relating to RAIN, or to our products or our platform;\n\u2022\nlate, delayed or cancelled payments from our customers; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.\nA substantial portion of our operating expenses are fixed for the short term, and as a result, fluctuations in revenue or unanticipated expenses can have a material and immediate impact on our profitability and negatively affect our operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to U.S. Federal Income Tax\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $274.7 million and federal research and development credit carryforwards of $18.3 million which we may use to reduce future taxable income or offset income taxes due. We have established a valuation allowance against the carrying value of these deferred tax assets. The tax loss and research and development credit carryforwards began expiring in 2020. Insufficient future taxable income will adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs and credit carryforwards. Reductions in corporate tax rates may also reduce our ability to utilize the NOLs.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, a corporation that experiences a more-than 50% ownership change over a three-year testing period is limited in its ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax assets to offset future taxable income or income taxes. Our existing NOLs and credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes; if we undergo a future ownership change then our ability to use our NOLs and credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state law. As a result of these limitations, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of, or possibly any of, the NOLs and credit carryforwards.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. During the ordinary course of business, we use significant judgment in evaluating our worldwide income-tax obligations and we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax determinations are proper, the final determination of any tax audits and possible litigation could be materially different from our historical income-tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, any of which could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are either not applicable or an exemption from such taxes applies. Sales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future, including as a result of a change in law. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may negatively affect our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Reporting and Disclosure\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, in turn, lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among other things, requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.\nFor example, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we availed ourselves of an exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption since we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d on December 31, 2021. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2404 will continue to divert resources and take significant time and effort. Moreover, we may be unable to successfully complete all the procedures, certifications and attestation requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner.\nAdditionally, we have previously identified and reported material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in prior years, and while these identified material weaknesses have been remediated, there can be no assurance that our remediation will be effective in future periods or prevent other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting from arising in the future. We may identify additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in future periods. A material weakness, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business.\nAny failure to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including identifying material weaknesses, could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC and other regulatory authorities.\nWe have incurred and, in the future, will incur high costs of being a public company.\nWe have incurred significant legal, accounting and other costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d on December 31, 2021 and are no longer eligible for reduced disclosure requirements and exemptions applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As such, we will be required to hold a say-on-pay vote and a say-on-frequency vote at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. We expect that our loss of \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status will require additional attention from management and will result in increased costs to us, which could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated with investor relations activities, among others. We have hired and may need to continue to hire additional accounting and information technology staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company.\nWe have and will continue to incur costs associated with recently adopted corporate governance requirements, including those of the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market. We expect those governance requirements to lead to ongoing legal and financial costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect those requirements to increase the difficulty and expense for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may need to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or pay substantially higher costs to obtain similar or higher coverage to what we have today. As a result, we may find it difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers or may need to pay higher compensation to attract and retain them. Although we monitor developments with respect to those requirements, we cannot predict or estimate the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Relating to Owning or Trading of Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nSince July 2016, when we sold shares of our common stock in our initial public offering through December 31, 2021, our stock price has ranged from $9.95 to $94.39. The following factors, in addition to general risks and other risks described in this report, may have a material effect on the trading price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance, stock market valuations, and volatility in the market prices of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ndelays in end-user deployments of RAIN systems;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nsupply interruptions, including semiconductor wafer or other product shortfalls;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to intellectual property rights or in disputes relating to those rights;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nunstable regional political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our stock;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived security breaches;\n\u2022\nlimited public float;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nfinancial analysts dropping or reducing their coverage of us; changes in financial estimates by analysts who do cover us; or our failure to meet analyst estimates or investor expectations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the values of companies investors perceive to be comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections.\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of markets in which we operate.\nTechnology company stocks like ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class-action litigation is frequently instituted against companies whose stock prices decline significantly, as it was against us. Such litigation causes substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. For further information regarding this litigation risk, please refer to Note 11 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe may need to raise additional capital which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to stockholders, restricting our operations or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nIn the course of running our business we may need to raise capital, potentially diluting our stockholders. In December 2019, we issued and sold $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2026, or the 2019 Notes. In November 2021, we issued and sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% convertible senior notes due 2027, or the 2021 Notes and we may in the future engage in additional equity, equity-linked or debt financings to secure additional funds. We used approximately $183.6 million of the net proceeds, excluding accrued interest, to repurchase approximately $76.4 million aggregate principal of the 2019 Notes through individual privately negotiated transactions concurrent with such offering. If unforeseen circumstances drive our financing needs, such as unforeseen expenditures or if our operating results are worse than we expect, then we may not be able to raise capital on favorable terms, if at all. Debt financing, if available, may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, expending capital or declaring dividends, or which impose financial covenants that limit our ability to achieve our business objectives. If we need but cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms then we may not be able to meet our business objectives, our stock price may fall, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nTransactions relating to the 2019 Notes or the 2021 Notes may affect our stock\u2019s value.\nIf the 2019 Notes or the 2021 Notes are converted by holders, then we have the ability under the indenture for the 2019 Notes to deliver cash, stock or any combination of cash or stock, at our election. If we elect to deliver stock, then doing so will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the stock issuable upon a conversion could decrease our stock price. Anticipated future conversions of the 2019 Notes or the 2021 Notes into shares of our stock could also decrease our stock price. Certain holders of the 2019 Notes or the 2021 Notes may also engage in short selling to hedge their position in the 2019 Notes or the 2021 Notes, which could also decrease our stock price.\nIn connection with us issuing the 2019 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped-call transactions with financial counterparties. The capped-call transactions are generally designed to reduce potential dilution to our stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2019 Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2019 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. From time to time, the financial counterparties to the capped calls may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our stock or purchasing or selling our stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the capped calls. This activity could cause a decrease in our stock price.\nFor more information on the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the capped-call transactions, see Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 25.0% of our stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may be able to significantly influence, in their capacity as stockholders, matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including electing directors and approving mergers, acquisitions or other transactions. They may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or management.\nServicing the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, and our current and future indebtedness may limit our operating flexibility or otherwise affect our business.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any current or future indebtedness, including the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the 2019 Notes or 2021 Notes or upon any fundamental change if holders require us to repurchase their 2019 Notes or 2021 Notes for cash, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient future cash from operations to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in us defaulting on our debt obligations. In addition, our existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash available to run our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the RAIN industry;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our availability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or for other purposes.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware or Washington law could make an acquisition of us difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit our stock price.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect our stock price. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes, each of which stands for election once every three years (subject to gradual declassification beginning at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, such that our board of directors will be fully declassified beginning at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders);\n\u2022\nrestrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any uncontested election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose);\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chair of the board, our chief executive officer or by the board of directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders will be permitted to amend our bylaws only upon receiving at least two-thirds of the total votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the future. These provisions prohibit a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16182, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PI"}
