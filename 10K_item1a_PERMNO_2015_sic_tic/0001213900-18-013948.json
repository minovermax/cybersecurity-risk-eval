{"cik": "1713863", "company": "Rafael Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-10-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks associated with any one of our businesses, as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about competition. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. Note that references to \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cthe Company\u201d, etc. used in each risk factor below refers to the business about which such risk factor is provided.\nRisks Related to the Business\nRisk Related to our Real Estate Assets\nEconomic, regulatory, and socio-economic changes that impact the real estate market generally, or that could affect patterns of use of commercial office space, may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties.\nIf our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, it may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance and long- or short-term value of our properties:\n\u25cf changes in the national, regional, and local economic climates, particularly in markets in which we have our properties;\n\u25cf local office submarket conditions such as changes in the supply of, or demand for, space in properties similar to those that we own within a particular area;\n\u25cf changes in the patterns of office use due to technological advances which may make telecommuting more prevalent;\n\u25cf the attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage funds that may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive;\n\u25cf the financial stability of our tenants, including bankruptcies, financial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants;\n\u25cf changes in operating costs and expenses, including costs for maintenance (planned and unplanned), insurance and real estate taxes, and our ability to control rents in light of such changes;\n\u25cf the need to periodically fund the costs to repair, renovate and re-lease space;\n\u25cf earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist acts or acts of war, which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;\n\u25cf changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards.\nAny of these factors may prevent us from maintaining the value of our real estate properties.\nThe geography of our real estate holdings may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the real estate markets of those areas.\nIn addition to general, regional and national economic conditions, our operating results are impacted by the economic conditions in New Jersey and Israel. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in New Jersey or Israel, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our property revenue, and hence net operating income.\nOur real estate is all commercial property and may leave our profitability vulnerable to a downturn in that sector.\nAll of our properties are commercial real estate. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in operating a single type of property. The impact of the downturn in demand for office properties has been more pronounced than if we owned a more fully diversified portfolio of real estate properties.\nAn increase in real estate taxes may decrease our net operating income from properties.\nGenerally, from time to time our property taxes may increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors. An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes results in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property. Although some tenant leases may permit us to pass through the tax increases to the tenants for payment, there is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis and we may be responsible for these increases as well as unleased portions of the properties. Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our net operating income and our cash available to pay distributions, if any.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses relating to real property or pay excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage.\nAlthough we attempt to ensure that all of our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses, there are certain types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, which are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Mortgage lenders generally insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property owners as a condition for providing mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available, or available at reasonable cost, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. We may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate coverage for any losses we may suffer. In addition, other than any capital reserve we may establish, we will have limited sources of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and we cannot assure you that those reserves will be sufficient.\nWe are dependent on IDT, Genie and their other affiliates for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in revenue from IDT and its affiliates would reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have generated majority of our revenue from IDT and its affiliates. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, IDT and its affiliates accounted for approximately 51% of our revenue. This decrease in concentration was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues from IDT and its affiliates due to modification of the terms of the leases. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, revenue from IDT and its affiliates would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe cost of complying with environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nAll real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions) relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. We also are required to comply with various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants or owners for the costs of investigating or remediating contaminated properties. These laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of removing or remediating could be substantial. In addition, the presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also may impose restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures by us. Environmental laws and regulations provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. For example, various federal, regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Among other things, \u201cgreen\u201d building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design, construction materials, water and energy usage and efficiency, and waste management. We are not aware of any such existing requirements that we believe will have a material impact on our current operations. However, future requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing new properties.\nOur costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for our operations or to pay distributions or make additional investments.\nOur real properties are generally subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. Under this Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Act has separate compliance requirements for \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d generally requiring that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The Act\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages. We attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Act or any relevant law or regulation of a foreign jurisdiction or place the burden on the seller or other third-party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with those laws or regulations. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.\nIf tenants decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of a renewal or new lease, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to security holders could be adversely affected\nWe face significant competition for tenants.\nThe leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors are rent, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the property to be leased. We directly compete with all owners, developers and operators of similar space in the areas in which our properties are located. Our commercial office properties are concentrated in New Jersey. There are number of competitive office properties in which our properties are located, which may be newer or better located than our properties and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease office space at our properties, and on the effective rents we are able to charge\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions.\nWe may acquire interests in properties, individual properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could significantly increase our size and alter our capital structure. Our acquisition activities may be exposed to, and their success may be adversely affected by, the following risks:\n\u25cf we may be unable to meet required closing conditions;\n\u25cf we may be unable to finance acquisitions and developments of properties on favorable terms or at all;\n\u25cf we may be unable to lease our acquired properties on the same terms or to the same level of occupancy as our existing properties;\n\u25cf acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected;\n\u25cf we may expend funds on, and devote management time to, acquisition opportunities which we do not complete, which may include non-refundable deposits;\n\u25cf our estimates of the costs we incur in renovating, improving, developing or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate;\n\u25cf we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for acquired properties; and\n\u25cf we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions and developments, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire properties subject to both known and unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse to the seller. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us arising from our ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include:\n\u25cf claims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising from dealing with the former owners of the properties;\n\u25cf liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties; and\n\u25cf liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination.\nCompetition for acquisitions may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of those acquisitions.\nWe may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other investors, particularly those investors who are willing to incur more leverage, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:\n\u25cf an inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors; and\n\u25cf an increase in the purchase price for such acquisition property.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire additional properties, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in the cost of acquisition opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Pharmaceutical Industry Investments\nOur pharmaceutical investments may not be able to develop any medicines of commercial value.\nAny drug that companies develop in preclinical and clinical studies, may not be able to succeed in demonstrating safety and efficacy of the product candidate in human clinical trials. Screening for and identifying product candidates may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable medicines to treat cancer and other illnesses the failure of which would harm to our pharmaceutical investments.\nThe pharmaceutical investment companies may not be successful in their efforts to identify or discover potential product candidates.\nThe key elements of Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 and LipoMedix\u2019s (collectively, referred to as \u201cthe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u201d) strategy are for Rafael Pharmaceuticals to identify and test compounds that target alterations found in the enzymes of cancer cells related to its production of energy widely known as cancer metabolism, and for LipoMedix to find drug carrier systems such as liposomes or other nanoparticles to deliver effectively and safely powerful anticancer compounds for which minimizing toxicity is critical. A significant portion of the research that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are conducting involves new compounds and drug discovery methods and suitable drug delivery systems, including the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 proprietary technology. The drug discovery that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are conducting using the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 proprietary technology may not be successful in identifying compounds that are useful in treating cancer. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying appropriate biomarkers, potential product candidates or effective carrier systems to confer a drug delivery advantage.\n\u25cf potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to not be effective, have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be medicines that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may choose to focus the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 efforts and resources on a potential product candidate that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are unable to identify suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 financial position and adversely impact the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 valuation.\nIf clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, and any collaborators, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Foreign regulatory authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, impose similar requirements. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 lead product candidates in humans as well as extensive preclinical development followed by extensive human clinical trials for any future candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. The clinical development of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. It is possible that even if one or more of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, or mistakenly believe that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, and impair the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to generate revenue from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. Moreover, if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 collaborators are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates beyond those that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies currently contemplate, if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 collaborators are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 collaborators may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf have the medicine removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 failure to successfully complete clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates would significantly harm our investment.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any collaborators, experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, potential clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, including:\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators or investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u25cf clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may decide, or regulators may require them, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may be larger than they anticipate; enrollment in these clinical trials, which may be particularly challenging for some of the orphan diseases the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies target in their programs, may be slower than the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies anticipate; or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than they anticipate;\n\u25cf third-party contractors used by the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 or their collaborators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf regulators, institutional review boards, or the data safety monitoring board for such trials may require that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, their collaborators or their investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may be greater than anticipated;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, their collaborators or their investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials; and\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 may be unable to meet the endpoints established by the FDA for approval.\nProduct development costs for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any collaborators, will increase if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or they, experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may have the exclusive right to commercialize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates or allow the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors, or the competitors of any collaborators, to bring products to market before the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any collaborators do and impair the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to successfully commercialize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates and may harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates. The occurrence of any of these events would negatively impact the value of our investments.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or they are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States. Enrollment may be particularly challenging for some of the orphan diseases the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies target in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 programs. In addition, some of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is also affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nRafael Pharmaceuticals focuses its development activities on patients with rarer or more difficult to treat forms of cancer. As a result, the potential patient populations for Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 clinical trials are narrowed, and Rafael Pharmaceuticals may experience difficulties in identifying and enrolling a sufficient number of patients in Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 clinical trials.\nIn addition, other companies are conducting clinical trials, or may in the future conduct clinical trials, which may have similar eligibility criteria as the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 current or future clinical trials and which could implicate enrollment of patients and selection of clinical trial sites.\nFurthermore, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials and while the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have agreements governing their committed activities, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have limited influence over their actual performance. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 or their collaborators\u2019 inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials may result in increased development costs for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, which would cause the value of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 to decline and limit the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to obtain additional financing. The occurrence of any of these events would negatively impact the value of our investments.\nIf serious adverse side effects or unexpected characteristics are identified during the development of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may need to abandon or limit the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 development of some of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates.\nAll of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 lead product candidates are still in clinical stage development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. Adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If adverse effects were to arise in patients being treated with any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, it could require them to halt, delay or interrupt clinical trials of such product candidate or adversely affect the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to obtain requisite approvals to advance the development and commercialization of such product candidate. If any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially show promise in earlier stage testing for treating cancer, or other diseases have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are unable to develop any of their product candidates, it would negatively impact the value of our investments.\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may expend their limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have limited financial and managerial resources, their focus on research programs and product candidates that they may or will identify for specific indications. As a result, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 resource allocation decisions may cause them to fail to capitalize on viable commercial medicines or profitable market opportunities. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable medicines. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, they may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for them to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate and may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approval for any of their product candidates.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate. It is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept for substantive review, any NDAs that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies submit or may conclude after review of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 data that the relevant application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of the relevant product candidates. If the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, does not accept or approve the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 NDAs for any of their product candidates, those authorities may require that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies conduct additional clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before they will reconsider the applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA-required trials or studies, approval of any NDA or application that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies submit may be delayed by several years, or may require them to expend more resources than they have available. It is also possible that additional trials or studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 NDAs. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent commercialization of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, generating revenue and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be forced to abandon their development efforts, which could significantly harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business and the value of our investments.\nEven if any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates receives marketing approval, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or others may later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, which could compromise the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability, or that of any future collaborators, to market the product.\nClinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates are conducted in carefully defined sets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 clinical trials, or those of any future collaborator, may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or others, discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be subject to government fines, seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf the product may become less competitive; and\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 reputation may suffer.\nShould any of these events occur, the value of our pharmaceutical investments may be negatively impacted.\nEven if any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic;\n\u25cf the ability to offer the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 medicines for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf ensuring uninterrupted product supply;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nThe failure to achieve market acceptance could significantly harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business and the value of our investments.\nIf, in the future, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not be successful in commercializing their product candidates if and when they are approved.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have little experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved medicine for which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies retain sales and marketing responsibilities, they must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to other third parties. In the future, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to sell, or participate in sales activities with their collaborators for, some of their product candidates if and when they are approved.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies recruit a sales force and establishes marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, they would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot retain or reposition their sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 efforts to commercialize their medicines on their own include:\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future medicines;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary medicines to be offered by sales personnel, which may put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, their product revenue or the profitability of product revenue to them are likely to be lower than if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies were to market and sell any medicines that they develop themselves. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market their product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 medicines effectively. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on their own or in collaboration with third parties, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies will not be successful in commercializing their product candidates.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than they do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies face competition with respect to their current product candidates, and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies and their collaborators will face competition with respect to any product candidates that they or their collaborators may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are developing their product candidates, such as pancreatic cancer, and, acute myelogenous leukemia amongst others. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 approach. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are developing most of their initial product candidates for the treatment of cancer. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy, and cancer drugs are frequently prescribed off-label by healthcare professionals. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies expect that if their product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. This may make it difficult for them to achieve their business strategy of using their product candidates in combination with existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with their product candidates.\nRafael Pharmaceutical is focused on an area known as cancer metabolism and there are also a number of product candidates in preclinical or clinical development by third parties to treat cancer by targeting cancer metabolism. These companies include large pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pfizer, Inc., and Genzyme, a Sanofi company. There are also biotechnology companies of various sizes that are developing therapies to target cancer metabolism, including, but not limited to, 3V Biosciences, Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Eleison Pharmaceuticals, Forma Therapeutics, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Calithera Biosciences, Inc., Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Forma Therapeutics Holdings LLC, Shire Biochem Inc., Raze Therapeutics, Inc. and Selvita S.A.\nLipoMedix faces competition from (i) other liposome and nanomedicine products in solid tumors (for example, Doxil (Janssen), Onivyde (Ipsen), Abraxane (Celgene)); (ii) other non-liposomal chemotherapeutic drugs in gastrointestinal malignancies recently developed or under development (for example, TAS-102 (Taiho) in colorectal cancer); (iii) biological therapy (including small molecule kinase inhibitors) recently developed or under development for colon cancer (for example Regorafenib (Bayer)); and (iv) immunotherapy approaches in gastrointestinal malignancies (for example Merck USA), antibodies and/or vaccinations; and (v) other large companies such as Roche.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that they are developing or that would render their product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors may discover biomarkers that more efficiently measure metabolic pathways than the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 methods, which may give them a competitive advantage in developing potential products. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may obtain approval, which could result in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors establishing a strong market position before they are able to enter the market.\nMany of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors. Smaller and other clinical stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 programs.\nEven if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators are able to commercialize any product candidates, such products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business.\nThe commercial success of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates will be paid by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health coverage insurers. If coverage and reimbursement is not available, or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or any future collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 or their investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenue the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability or the ability of any future collaborators to recoup the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability, and the ability of any future collaborators, to commercialize any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability or that of any future collaborators to sell the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates profitably. These payors may not view the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 customers, or those of any future collaborators, or may not be sufficient to allow the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us, or any future collaborators, to decrease the price the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or they, might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenue. If the prices for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that they, or any future collaborator, commercializes and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates for which they, or any future collaborator, obtain marketing approval could significantly harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 operating results, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators could cause substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may develop.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies and their collaborators face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or they commercially sell any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or they may develop. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators cannot successfully defend ourselves or themselves against claims that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates or medicines caused injuries, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or medicines that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may develop;\n\u25cf injury to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf reduced resources of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 management to pursue the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business strategy; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may develop.\nAlthough the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may incur. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies anticipate that they will need to increase their insurance coverage when the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies continues clinical trials and if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies successfully commercializes any medicine. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. In addition, if one of their collaboration partners were to become subject to product liability claims or were unable to successfully defend themselves against such claims, any such collaboration partner could be more likely to terminate such relationships and therefore substantially limit the commercial potential of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 products.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of their businesses.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 operations also produce hazardous waste products. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from their use of hazardous materials, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed their resources. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover them for costs and expenses they may incur due to injuries to their employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against them in connection with their storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to operate their businesses effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 internal computer systems and those of third parties with which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 operations, and could result in a material disruption of their clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase their costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies could incur liability and their product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nEven if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent them from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, they will not be able to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, their product candidates, and their ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies and their collaborators have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expects to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist in this process.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved medicine not commercially viable.\nAccordingly, if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators experience delays in obtaining approval or if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or they fail to obtain approval of their product candidates, the commercial prospects for their product candidates may be harmed and their ability to generate any revenue will be materially impaired.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 other product candidates and affect the prices obtained.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or they, obtain marketing approval. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies expects that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nFor example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA. Among the provisions of the PPACA of potential importance to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 business and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates are the following:\n\u25cf an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u25cf a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u25cf expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u25cf new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u25cf a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u25cf a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u25cf a new Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and\n\u25cf a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2025. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and may otherwise affect the prices the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may obtain for any of their product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our medicines. Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. They cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 and any future collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Similar acts imposed by other countries may adversely affect the Company.\nIf the FDA does not grant the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 products appropriate periods of data exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, or any periods of exclusivity that are granted expire, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nThird party generic manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference-listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference-listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference-listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any reference-listed drug may be typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference-listed drug has expired. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference-listed drug is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference-listed drug. If a patent infringement lawsuit is timely filed against the ANDA applicant FDA may not approve the ANDA for 30 months unless the ANDA applicant obtains a favorable court decision sooner. The FDCA also provides a period of three years of new clinical investigation, or NCI, data exclusivity in connection with the approval of a supplemental indication for the product for which a clinical trial is essential for approval.\nIn the event that a generic manufacturer is able to obtain FDA approval despite any periods of data exclusivity we might obtain, the competition that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 approved products may face from generic versions could negatively impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments in those product candidates.\nIf Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are unable to obtain and maintain patent or trade secret protection for their medicines and technology, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, their competitors could develop and commercialize medicines and technology similar or identical to theirs, and their ability to successfully commercialize their medicines and technology may be adversely affected.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies success depends in large part on their ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to their proprietary medicines and technology. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies seek to protect their proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to their novel technologies and medicines that are important to our business.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although Pharmaceutical Investment Companies enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of their research and development output, such as their employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing their ability to seek patent protection. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have licensed patent rights, and in the future may license additional patent rights, from third parties. These licensed patent rights may be valuable to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies business, and they may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or medicines underlying such licenses. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of their business. If any such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and their right to develop and commercialize any of their products that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. In addition to the foregoing, the risks associated with patent rights that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies license from third parties also apply to patent rights they own.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect their technology or medicines or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and medicines. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of their patents or narrow the scope of their patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies cannot be certain that they were the first to make the inventions claimed in their owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that they were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. Beginning in March 2013, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 technology or products and compete directly with them, without payment to them, or result in their inability to manufacture or commercialize medicines without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide them with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with them or otherwise provide them with any competitive advantage. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent their patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and medicines. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019s.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce their patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 patents and other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that their patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or the Pharmaceutical Investment Companie\u2019 collaborators are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of their business.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 commercial success depends upon their ability and the ability of their collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell their product candidates and use their proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert infringement claims against the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or one of their collaborators are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or they could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 medicines and technology. However, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving their competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing and commercializing the infringing technology or medicine. In addition, we or our collaborators could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators from commercializing the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies product candidates or force the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies to cease some of their business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies or their collaborators have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be subject to claims that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 employees, consultants or advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies competitors or potential competitors. Although the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies try to ensure that their employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies , the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be subject to claims that they or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to their management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause them to incur significant expenses and could distract their technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class B common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than they can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are unable to protect the confidentiality of their trade secrets, their business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 technology and medicines, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain their competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as their employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with their employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 proprietary information, including their trade secrets, and they may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, they would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies. If any of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, their competitive position would be harmed.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for late-stage clinical trials and for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that Pharmaceutical Investment Companies will not have sufficient quantities of their product candidates or medicines or that such supply will not be available to them at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair their development or commercialization efforts.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not have any manufacturing facilities. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of their product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and for commercial supply of any of these product candidates for which they or their collaborators obtain marketing approval. To date, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies have obtained materials for their product candidates for our ongoing preclinical and clinical testing from third-party manufacturers.\n\u25cf The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be unable to establish any further long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u25cf reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u25cf the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies ; and\n\u25cf reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance, environmental and safety and pharmacovigilance reporting.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements on a global basis. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 failure, or the failure of their third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, import detentions for active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products manufactured outside of the U.S., seizures or recalls of product candidates or medicines, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of their medicines and harm our business and results of operations.\nAny medicines that the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies.\nAny performance failure on the part of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. The Pharmaceutical Investment Companies do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products. If any one of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies may be required to replace that manufacturer. Although the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture their product candidates, they may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nThe Pharmaceutical Investment Companies\u2019 current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of their product candidates or medicines may adversely affect their future profit margins and their ability to commercialize any medicines that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to Business Generally\nThe reporting requirements associated with our being a public company subjects us to significant expenses.\nAs a result of the Spin-Off from IDT Corporation in March 2018, we are a public reporting company and are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission reports required by the Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, among other requirements, we need to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K and under some circumstances, current reports on Form 8-K, in accordance with strict timelines. We are also required to file annual proxy materials. In addition, as part of those filings, we are required to provide annual audited financial statements. Compliance with such requirements significantly increased our legal and accounting costs and demand significant attention from management. The resources and time required to comply with rules applicable to public companies divert financial and human resources from focusing on our business, and we can provide no assurance that the benefits of our being public outweigh the disadvantages and costs associated with compliance. We currently anticipate our total costs to be between $2,000,000 to $2,300,000 a year as a result of being a public reporting company. Several of the costs included in this estimated range are preliminary, subject to negotiation, and may vary from the estimates when finalized.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect the management of the Company.\nHoward S. Jonas our Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer controls a majority of the voting power of our capital stock. As of October 10, 2018, Mr. Jonas has voting power over 787,163 shares of our Class A common stock (which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis) and 1,339,959 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 70.5% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Mr. Jonas will be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management is limited.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud.\nUpon the completion of the Spin-Off, we became a public company in the United States subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, a newly public company is not required to comply with either the management or the auditor reporting requirements related to internal control over financial reporting until its second annual report, if applicable.\nFurther, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u25cf an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; and\n\u25cf an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions until the end of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial registration statement filed related to our Spin-Off from IDT, or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company and, if we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public companies in which you hold equity. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nIn addition, if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, as an accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, after we become a public company, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nAdditionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\nInvestors may suffer dilution.\nWe may engage in equity financing to fund our future operations and growth. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest (both with respect to the percentage of total securities held, and with respect to the book value of their securities) and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nThe relationships between Howard S. Jonas and IDT Corporation, Genie Energy and Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc. could conflict with our stockholders\u2019 interests.\nHoward S. Jonas, our controlling stockholder, Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer is also the chairman and controlling stockholder of IDT Corporation, chairman of the board and controlling stockholder of Genie and is chairman of the board of Rafael Pharmaceuticals and holds certain direct and indirect interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals in addition to his interests through ownership of our common stock. These relationships may cause a conflict of interest with our stockholders.\nFurthermore, several members of our executive management team are serving as officers of IDT.\nWe exercised our option for the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under NYSE MKT rules with respect to our Nominating Committee.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring a board of directors with a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. These independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We applied this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption for our corporate governance practices only with respect to the independence requirements of our Nominating Committee. Accordingly, with respect to our Nominating Committee you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American, and if we were to apply the controlled company exemption to other independence requirements, you would not have the protection afforded by those requirements either.\nWe have limited resources and could find it difficult to raise additional capital.\nWe were formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDT Corporation. On March 26, 2018, IDT\u2019s interest in us was spun-off by IDT to IDT\u2019s stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock held by IDT to IDT\u2019s stockholders (the Spin-Off). As a result of the Spin-Off, we are independent from IDT. We have no operating history as an independent company, and no current sources of financing. Any financing formerly provided to us by IDT is no longer available. We may need to raise additional capital for operations and in order for stockholders to realize increased value on our securities. Given the current global economy and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funding on commercially reasonable terms in a timely fashion. Failure to receive the funding could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and financial condition.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk.\nWe hold a warrant to purchase a significant stake in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, as well as other equity and governance rights in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, which we can\u2019t exercise, in full, at this time and may never be able to exercise.\nAs of the date hereof and based on the current shares issued and outstanding of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, we, and our affiliates that hold interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals would need to pay in the aggregate approximately $61 million to exercise the Warrant in full and approximately $46 million to purchase a 51% controlling stake in Rafael Pharmaceuticals. On an as-converted fully diluted basis (for all convertible securities of Rafael Pharmaceuticals outstanding), we and our affiliates that hold interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals would need approximately $112 million to exercise the Warrant in full and approximately $88 million to purchase a 51% controlling stake in Rafael Pharmaceuticals as more fully discussed above on page 4. Following that exercise, a portion of our interest in Rafael Pharmaceuticals would continue to be held for the benefit of the other equity holders in IDT-Rafael Holdings and CS Pharma. Given the Company\u2019s anticipated available cash, we would not be able to exercise the warrant in its entirety and we may never be able to exercise the warrant in full.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future results as an independent company.\nOur historical financial information may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been an independent company during the prior periods presented or be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future now that we are an independent company.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class B common stock is likely to remain volatile, and purchasers of our Class B common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to remain volatile. The stock market in general and the market for real estate/pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their Class B common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our Class B common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that operate in the real estate or pharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions,\n\u25cf strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u25cf announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders. In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock after the completion of the Spin-Off, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation from IDT, and the separation could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation from IDT via the Spin-Off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation from IDT is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: enhanced strategic and management focus; better ability to form strategic partnerships and relationships; faster decision-making; more efficient allocation of capital; alignment of incentives with performance objectives; direct access to the capital markets; and a distinct investment identity.\nWe may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others:\n\u25cf we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of IDT;\n\u25cf our business is less diversified than IDT\u2019s business prior to the separation; and\n\u25cf the other actions required to separate the respective businesses could disrupt our operations.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation from IDT, or if such benefits are delayed, our business could be harmed.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk.\nWe have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. We expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in the industries in which we operate.\nAll of the Pharmaceutical Investment Companies product candidates are still in preclinical development. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to initiate or successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes about ten to fifteen years to develop one new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, as a new business in general, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nIf we do not successfully address these risks, our revenue could decline and our ability to pursue our growth strategy and attain profitability could be compromised.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will hold significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments that are subject to various market risks.\nAs of July 31, 2018, we held approximately $40.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and liquid marketable securities, $3.3 million in current notes receivable, approximately $4.2 million in interests in hedge funds and approximately $2.0 million in securities in another entity that are not liquid. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities figures include $10 million held in a controlled entity of which we are effectively a 45% owner. Investments in marketable securities and hedge funds carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that we will be able to redeem any hedge fund investments at any time or that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict the course of price movements of securities and other instruments and, in general, the securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. Our passive interests in other entities are not currently liquid and we cannot assure that they we will be able to liquidate them when we desire, or ever. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 17344, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "RFL"}
