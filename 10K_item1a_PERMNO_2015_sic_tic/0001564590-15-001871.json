In addition, this report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below. The occurrence of one or more of the events listed below could also have a significant adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is highly regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products and services are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, local and international statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules and guidance. These requirements generally mandate licensing or authorization as a lender or as a credit services organization or credit access business, or CSO, establish limits on the amount, duration, renewals or extensions of and charges for (including interest rates and fees) various categories of loans, direct the form and content of our loan contracts and other documentation, restrict collection practices, outline underwriting requirements and subject us to periodic examination and ongoing supervision by regulatory authorities, among other things. Because short-term loans, installment loans and line of credit accounts to consumers, such as those provided by us, are viewed as extensions of credit in the United States, we must comply with certain federal laws, such as TILA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, among other laws, and with respect to our CSO programs, the FDCPA, as well as regulations adopted to implement those laws. In addition, our marketing and disclosure efforts and the representations made about our products and services are subject to unfair and deceptive practice statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 in the United States and analogous state statutes under which the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the CFPB, state attorneys general or private plaintiffs may bring legal actions.\nWe are also subject to various international laws, licensing or authorization requirements and disciplinary actions in connection with the products or services we offer in Australia, China, Brazil, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which are discussed below. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance requires forms, processes, procedures, training, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may also create operational constraints, be costly or adversely affect operating results. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d of Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the laws applicable to us.\nThe regulatory environment in which we conduct our business is extensive and complex. From time to time we become aware of instances where our products and services have not fully complied with requirements under applicable laws and regulations or applicable contracts. Determinations of compliance with applicable requirements or contracts, such as those discussed above, can be highly technical and subject to varying interpretations. When we become aware of such an instance, whether as a result of our compliance reviews, regulator inquiry, customer complaint or otherwise, we generally conduct a review of the activity in question and determine how to address it, such as modifying the product, making customer refunds or providing additional disclosure. We also evaluate whether reports or other notices to regulators are required and provide notice to regulators whenever required. In some cases we have decided to take corrective action even after applicable statutory or regulatory cure periods have expired, and in some cases we have notified regulators even where such notification may not have been required. Regulators or customers reviewing such incidents or remedial activities may interpret the laws, regulations and customer contracts differently than we have, or may choose to take regulatory action against us or bring private litigation against us notwithstanding the corrective measures we have taken. This may be the case even if we no longer offer the product or service in question.\nState, federal and international regulators, as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 bars, have subjected our industry to intense scrutiny in recent years. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, or any finding that our past forms, practices, processes, procedures, controls or infrastructure were insufficient or not in compliance, could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary, criminal or other penalties (some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations), result in the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), require us to refund interest or fees, result in a determination that certain loans are not collectible, result in a revocation of licenses or authorization to transact business, result in a finding that we have engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, limit our access to services provided by third-party financial institutions or cause damage to our reputation, brands and valued customer relationships.\nOur failure to comply with any regulations, rules or guidance applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe consumer lending industry continues to be targeted by new laws or regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the short-term consumer lending products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations.\nGovernments at the national, state and local levels, as well as international governments, may seek to impose new laws, regulatory restrictions or licensing requirements that affect the products or services we offer, the terms on which we may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations we must fulfill in connection with our consumer lending business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or to\nexpand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and may have a negative effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In some cases these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of our current business activities in certain jurisdictions, or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue.\nIn recent years, consumer loans, and in particular the category commonly referred to as \u201cpayday loans,\u201d which includes certain of our short-term loan products, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny that has resulted in increasingly restrictive regulations and legislation that makes offering such loans in certain states in the United States or the international countries where we operate (as further described below) less profitable or unattractive. Laws or regulations in some states in the United States require that all borrowers of certain short-term loan products be reported to a centralized database and limit the number of loans a borrower may receive or have outstanding. Other laws limit the availability of some of our consumer loan products in the United States to active duty military personnel, active members of the National Guard or members on active reserve duty and their immediate dependents.\nCertain consumer advocacy groups and federal and state legislators and regulators have advocated that laws and regulations should be tightened so as to severely limit, if not eliminate, the type of loan products and services we offer to consumers, and this has resulted in both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. federal government and state governmental bodies exhibiting an interest in debating legislation that could further regulate consumer loan products and services such as those that we offer. The U.S. Congress, as well as other similar federal, state and local bodies and similar international governmental authorities, have debated, and may in the future adopt, legislation or regulations that could, among other things, place a cap (or decrease a current cap) on the interest or fees that we can charge or a cap on the effective annual percentage rate that limits the amount of interest or fees that may be charged, ban or limit loan renewals or extensions (where the customer agrees to pay the current finance charge on a loan for the right to make payment of the outstanding principal balance of such loan at a later date plus an additional finance charge), including the rates to be charged for loan renewals or extensions, require us to offer an extended payment plan, limit origination fees for loans, require changes to our underwriting or collections practices, require short-term lenders to be bonded or require lenders to report consumer loan activity to databases designed to monitor or restrict consumer borrowing activity, impose \u201ccooling off\u201d periods between the time a loan is paid off and another loan is obtained or prohibit us from providing any of our consumer loan products in the United States to active duty military personnel, active members of the National Guard or members on active reserve duty and their immediate dependents.\nSignificant new laws and regulations have also been adopted in the United Kingdom, and further new laws and regulations will continue to be imposed. See \u201c- The United Kingdom has imposed, and continues to impose, increased regulation of the short-term high-cost credit industry with the stated expectation that some firms will exit the market\u201d below for additional information.\nWe cannot currently assess the likelihood of any future unfavorable federal, state, local or international legislation or regulations being proposed or enacted that could affect our products and services. We closely monitor proposed legislation in jurisdictions where we offer our loan products. Additional legislative or regulatory provisions could be enacted that could severely restrict, prohibit or eliminate our ability to offer a consumer loan product. In addition, under statutory authority, U.S. state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways or issue new administrative rules, even if not contained in state statutes, that could adversely affect the way we do business and may force us to terminate or modify our operations in particular states or affect our ability to obtain new licenses or renew the licenses we hold.\nFurthermore, legislative or regulatory actions may be influenced by negative perceptions of us and our industry, even if such negative perceptions are inaccurate, attributable to conduct by third parties not affiliated with us (such as other industry members), or attributable to matters not specific to our industry.\nAny of these or other legislative or regulatory actions that affect our consumer loan business at the national, state, international and local level could, if enacted or interpreted differently, have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination authority over our U.S. consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business.\nIn July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which regulates U.S. consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans offered by us. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of such providers.\nThe CFPB has begun exercising supervisory review over and examining certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans such as us. The CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar lenders, and ask questions about their business practices, and the examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities; loan application and\norigination activities; payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers; collections, accounts in default, and consumer reporting activities as well as third-party relationships. As a result of these examinations, we could be required to change our products, services or practices, whether as a result of another party being examined or as a result of an examination of us, or we could be subject to monetary penalties, which could materially adversely affect us.\nFurthermore, because the CFPB is a relatively new entity, its practices and procedures regarding examination, enforcement and other matters relevant to us and other CFPB-regulated entities are subject to further development and change. Where the CFPB holds powers previously assigned to other regulators, the CFPB may not continue to apply such powers or interpret relevant concepts consistent with previous regulators\u2019 practice. This may adversely affect our ability to anticipate the CFPB\u2019s expectations or interpretations in our interaction with the CFPB.\nThe CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. In addition to having the authority to obtain monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a Consent Order issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and any noncompliance would materially adversely affect our business.\nOn November 20, 2013, Cash America consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 review of Cash America and us, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. The Consent Order relates, in part, to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB during its 2012 examination of us, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the interest rate permitted by the federal Military Lending Act, for which we have made refunds of approximately $33,500, and for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB\u2019s examination of us. In addition, as a result of the CFPB\u2019s review, we enhanced our compliance management programs and are implementing additional policies and procedures to address the issues identified by the CFPB. We are also required to provide periodic reports to the CFPB. We are subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including the CFPB\u2019s order that we ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws and develop more robust compliance policies and procedures. These new policies, procedures and other initiatives are in many cases subject to review and potential objection by the CFPB, and no guarantee can be made regarding the timing, substance or effect of any such measures the CFPB may decide to take. Furthermore, the compliance plan mandated by the Consent Order requires us to perform a formal consumer protection compliance risk review before introducing or implementing new or changed products or services. This requirement could result in additional delay or cost when introducing or implementing new or changed products or services, or a decision not to proceed with such initiatives. Any noncompliance with the Consent Order or similar orders or agreements from other regulators could lead to further regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe CFPB has announced that it will soon promulgate new rules affecting the consumer lending industry, and these or subsequent new rules and regulations may significantly restrict the conduct of our U.S. consumer lending business.\nOn April 24, 2013, the CFPB issued a report entitled \u201cPayday Loans and Deposit Advance Products: A White Paper of Initial Findings,\u201d indicating that it had \u201cengaged in an in-depth review of short-term small dollar loans, including payday loans.\u201d The report discusses the initial findings of the CFPB regarding short-term payday loans, a category which the CFPB and some other regulators use to include certain of our short-term loan products, loans provided by non-bank financial institutions at storefront locations and deposit account advances offered by depository institutions. While the CFPB\u2019s study stated that \u201cthese products may work for some consumers for whom an expense needs to be deferred for a short period of time,\u201d the CFPB also stated that its \u201cfindings raised substantial consumer protection concerns\u201d related to the sustained use of payday loans and deposit account advances. The report also indicated that the CFPB planned to analyze the effectiveness of limitations such as cooling-off periods between payday loans, \u201cin curbing sustained use and other harms.\u201d In furtherance of that report, on March 25, 2014, the CFPB held a hearing on payday lending and issued a report entitled \u201cCFPB Data Point: Payday Lending,\u201d presenting \u201cthe results of several analyses of consumers\u2019 use of payday loans.\u201d The report presents the CFPB\u2019s findings as to borrowers\u2019 loan sequences, which refers to a series of loans a borrower may take out following an initial loan. The CFPB found that payday borrowing typically involves multiple renewals following an initial loan, rather than distinct loans separated by at least 15 days. The report states that for the majority of loan sequences, there is no reduction in the principal amount between the first and last loan in the sequence. In the reports and subsequent statements, the CFPB reiterated its commitment to use its various tools to protect consumers from unlawful acts and practices in connection with the offering\nof consumer financial products and services. Both the April 24, 2013 white paper and the March 25, 2014 report indicated that online payday loans were not the focus of the CFPB\u2019s reports, but the CFPB has indicated that it is currently analyzing borrowing activity by consumers using online payday loans.\nThe CFPB announced that it is in the late stages of considering the formulation of rules regarding consumer loans, including certain of our short-term loan products, that will ensure that consumers can get the credit they need without long-term impact to their financial futures. These rules will likely impose limitations on payday lending. We do not currently know the nature and extent of the rules that the CFPB will adopt, but those rules could be proposed and adopted this year. If the CFPB adopts any rules or regulations that significantly restrict the conduct of our business, any such rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could make the continuance of all or part of our U.S. business impractical or unprofitable. Any new rules or regulations adopted by the CFPB could also result in significant compliance costs.\nThe United Kingdom has imposed, and continues to impose, increased regulation of the short-term high-cost credit industry with the stated expectation that some firms will exit the market.\nIn the United Kingdom, we are subject to regulation by the FCA, the FSMA, the CCA, and secondary legislation passed under it, among other rules and regulations. In December 2012, the U.K. Parliament passed the FSA Act 2012, which created a new regulatory framework for the supervision and regulation of the consumer credit industry in the United Kingdom, including the consumer lending industry in which we operate. The FSA Act 2012 mandated that in April 2014, the FCA take over responsibility for regulating consumer credit from the OFT, and it also made changes to the relevant legislation including the CCA and the FSMA.\nThe FCA regulates consumer credit and related activities pursuant to the FSMA and the FCA Handbook, which includes prescriptive rules and regulations and carries across many of the standards set out in the CCA and its secondary legislation as well as the Guidance. The regulations under the FCA consumer credit regime are more prescriptive than the former U.K. consumer credit regime. The FSMA gives the FCA the power to authorize, supervise, examine and bring enforcement actions against providers of consumer credit, as well as to make rules for the regulation of consumer credit. On February 28, 2014, the FCA issued the CONC contained in the FCA Handbook. The CONC incorporates prescriptive regulations for consumer loans such as those that we offer, including mandatory affordability checks on borrowers, limiting the number of rollovers to two, restricting how lenders can advertise, banning advertisements that the FCA deems misleading, and introducing a limit of two unsuccessful attempts on the use of continuous payment authority (which provides a creditor the ability to directly debit a customer\u2019s account for payment when authorized by the customer to do so) to pay off a loan. Certain provisions of the CONC took effect on April 1, 2014, and other provisions for high-cost short-term credit providers, such as the limits on rollovers, continuous payment authority and advertising, took effect on July 1, 2014. As a result of the FCA\u2019s requirements, we made significant adjustments to many of our business practices in the United Kingdom, as discussed below under \u201c- Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom have expressed and continue to express serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which has caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that have impacted and will continue to negatively impact our operations and results, and this impact has been and will continue to be significant.\u201d\nIn addition, on December 18, 2013, the United Kingdom passed the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act, which includes an amendment to the FSMA that requires the FCA to introduce rules \u201cwith a view to securing an appropriate degree of protection for borrowers against excessive charges\u201d on \u201chigh-cost short-term\u201d consumer loans. On July 15, 2014, the FCA issued a consultation paper that proposed a cap on the total cost of high-cost short-term credit and requested comments on the proposal. The consultation paper proposed a maximum rate of 0.8% of principal per day, and the proposal limits the total fees, interest (including post-default interest) and charges (including late fees which are capped at \u00a315) to an aggregate amount not to exceed 100% of the principal amount loaned. The FCA requested comments on the proposal and issued its final rule on November 11, 2014. The final rule was largely the same as the proposed rule and required us to make changes to all of our high-cost short-term products in the United Kingdom. As a result of the final rule, we discontinued offering line of credit accounts to new customers in the United Kingdom and effective January 1, 2015, we discontinued draws on existing accounts in the United Kingdom. Once U.K. customers have paid off their outstanding line of credit balance, they may apply for either a short-term or installment loan. We also expect to introduce additional short-term and installment loan products during 2015. We expect revenues from these new and existing products to offset the lost revenue from our discontinued line of credit offerings in the United Kingdom. The final rule became effective on January 2, 2015, as required by the 2013 amendment to the FSMA. In addition, on February 24, 2015, the FCA issued a consultation paper that, among other things, proposes to remove the exemption from the requirement that providers of high-cost short-term credit include a risk warning in financial promotions and to amend its rules to allow firms to introduce continuous payment authority to collect repayments where a customer is in arrears or default and the lender is exercising forbearance. The FCA has requested comments on the proposals by May 6, 2015.\nThe FCA has stated that actions taken by it with respect to the payday industry will likely force a quarter or more of the firms out of the industry in the United Kingdom. The rule changes are likely to continue to have a significant effect on the results of our U.K. operations in the first half of 2015. Any changes that we made to our U.K. business as a result of the final rule could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our U.K. operations represented 40.1% and 47.1%, respectively, of our consolidated total revenue. The results for the year ended December 31, 2014 do not include the full impact of the changes described above, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2013 do not include any impact of the changes described above. The results for each of these periods are not indicative of our future results of operations and cash flows from our operations in the United Kingdom.\nThese changes that we have implemented or are required to implement in the future as a result of such legislative and regulatory activities could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. business, as further described below under \u201c- Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom have expressed and continue to express serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which has caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that have impacted and will continue to negatively impact our operations and results, and this impact has been and will continue to be significant ,\u201d and \u201c- Due to restructuring of the consumer credit regulatory framework in the United Kingdom, we are required to obtain full authorization from our U.K. regulators to continue providing consumer credit and perform related activities in the United Kingdom, and there is no guarantee that we will receive full authorization to continue offering consumer loans in the United Kingdom.\u201d\nDue to restructuring of the consumer credit regulatory framework in the United Kingdom, we are required to obtain full authorization from our U.K. regulators to continue providing consumer credit and perform related activities in the United Kingdom, and there is no guarantee that we will receive full authorization to continue offering consumer loans in the United Kingdom.\nWe have obtained interim permission from the FCA to provide consumer credit and perform related activities. We are required to apply for and obtain full authorization from the FCA to continue to provide consumer credit. We submitted our application for full authorization before the February 28, 2015 deadline for providers of high-cost short term credit and will submit our application for our near-prime lending business before the August 31, 2015 deadline. In order to obtain full authorization, and as a threshold condition to maintaining our interim permission to provide consumer credit in the United Kingdom, we are required to demonstrate that we satisfy, and will continue to satisfy, certain minimum standards set out in the FSMA, including certain specified \u201cthreshold conditions,\u201d and this may result in additional costs to us that could be significant. As a \u201cthreshold condition\u201d to maintaining our interim permission and to obtaining and retaining full authorization, the FCA must be satisfied that we can be \u201ceffectively supervised\u201d by the FCA, as this term is defined in the FSMA. The FCA informed us that it had concerns that we could not be \u201ceffectively supervised\u201d given our previous structure with all of our operations conducted outside of the United Kingdom. We have historically performed substantially all of our U.K. business operations from the United States, as business functions have been performed remotely from our U.S. facilities. In order to alleviate the FCA\u2019s concerns in relation to our ability to presently demonstrate to the FCA that we are capable of being effectively supervised, we have established an office as well as the management of our U.K. business in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the FCA must approve certain individuals conducting \u201ccontrolled functions\u201d with respect to the operation and management of our U.K. business. All of these changes will result in additional costs to us. We are in frequent communication with the FCA regarding our activities to address the FCA\u2019s concerns about the threshold conditions. The FCA has the power to revoke our interim permission to conduct a consumer credit business if it determines we do not meet the threshold conditions. Additionally, the FCA could elect to impose additional conditions that could delay the authorization process, further increase our compliance costs or require further changes to the conduct of our U.K. business that could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. operations.\nThe FCA is expected to complete the process of reviewing applications of previous OFT license holders, such as us, for full authorization by April 1, 2016, and there is no guarantee that we will receive full authorization for either or both of our U.K. businesses. If we do not receive full authorization for either of our U.K. lending businesses, we will have to cease that business.\nOur primary regulators in the United Kingdom have expressed and continue to express serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that have impacted and will continue to negatively impact our operations and results, and this impact has been and will continue to be significant.\nIn February 2012, the OFT launched a review of the payday lending sector to assess the sector\u2019s compliance with the CCA, the Guidance, and other relevant guidance and legal obligations. As part of this review, the OFT conducted examinations of a number of payday lenders in the United Kingdom, including us, to assess individual company compliance with these laws and guidance. In May 2013, the OFT sent us a letter of findings related to its examination of our U.K. short term consumer loan (or payday) business, which indicated that we may not have been complying fully with all aspects of the Guidance, the CCA and other relevant laws and guidance. This letter indicated the OFT\u2019s general and specific concerns in the following categories: advertising and marketing, pre-contract information and explanations, affordability assessments, rollovers, debt forbearance and debt collection, and regulatory and other compliance issues. As requested by the OFT, in July 2013, we provided the OFT with an independent audit report setting out the steps taken to address each concern the OFT had identified in its letter. Through March 2014, we continued to receive additional requests for data and documentation from the OFT, and we complied with those requests.\nOn April 1, 2014 the FCA assumed the supervision and regulation of us, and we are subject to ongoing examination and review by the FCA. We continue to receive additional requests for data and documentation from the FCA about our consumer loan products and have been complying with those requests. The FCA informed us that it had serious concerns regarding our compliance with the FCA\u2019s\nrules and principles, including those with respect to our affordability assessment process in determining whether the loans we made were affordable for our customers and our debt forbearance practices (or our practices regarding customers who have indicated they are experiencing financial difficulty). The FCA also noted concerns regarding certain of our advertising practices. The FCA has appointed an independent auditor, referred to as a skilled person under section 166 of the FSMA, to undertake a review of certain of our practices, as well as our ability to be effectively supervised. If that review identifies activities that are deemed by the FCA to have caused consumer detriment or are not in compliance with the FCA\u2019s requirements, the FCA could require us to take remedial action (which could result in additional changes to our business practices and/or the payment of consumer redress), impose fines or penalties, refuse our full authorization application, withdraw our interim authorization or full authorization if granted, impose limitations or restrictions on our regulatory permission or take other actions.\nWe have been, and continue to be, in frequent communication with the FCA and the appointed skilled person regarding the concerns raised by the FCA and our efforts to address such concerns through, among other things, significant modifications to our business practices. The FCA is closely monitoring our efforts to comply with its requirements, including our changes to our business practices made in an effort to comply with the FCA\u2019s concerns. For example, we have established an office as well as the management of our U.K. business in the United Kingdom to help alleviate the FCA\u2019s concerns about effective supervision, and we will be required to obtain FCA approval of certain individuals performing \u201ccontrolled functions,\u201d as defined by applicable regulation, as discussed above under \u201c- Due to restructuring of the consumer credit regulatory framework in the United Kingdom, we are required to obtain full authorization from our U.K. regulators to continue providing consumer credit and perform related activities in the United Kingdom, and there is no guarantee that we will receive full authorization to continue offering consumer loans in the United Kingdom .\u201d\nIn addition, we made significant adjustments to many of our business practices, including modifying our affordability assessments and underwriting standards, reducing certain maximum loan amounts, changing our collections processes (including our practices relating to continuous payment authority) and debt forbearance practices and altering certain advertising practices, all of which resulted in a significant year-over-year decrease in our U.K. loan volume, U.K. loan balances and U.K. revenue in the second half of 2014. The implementation of stricter affordability assessments and underwriting standards resulted in a decrease in the number of consumer loans written, the average consumer loan amount and the total amount of consumer loans written to new and returning customers. Additionally, the changes we made to our collections and debt forbearance practices in the United Kingdom could result in lower collection rates for delinquent loans, and we experienced and will continue to experience an increase in compliance- and administrative-related costs for our U.K. operations. In addition, the FCA could require us to make additional changes to our business that could further negatively affect future results for our U.K. operations. We are continuing to assess the impact of the changes we have made to our U.K. operations and what additional changes we may elect to implement and what effect such changes may have on our business, but the impact of these changes is likely to be significant for the first half of 2015 and could result in a material adverse effect on our U.K. business and our prospects, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement the changes we are making to our U.K. business described above or any additional changes we may be required to make to our U.K business to address concerns raised by the FCA. Any inability to make changes to the satisfaction of the FCA could also have an adverse effect on our existing interim authorization from the FCA to continue to provide consumer credit and on our ability to obtain full authorization from the FCA, and we may not be able to successfully resolve the concerns expressed by the FCA. Any such changes or our failure to successfully make any such changes or resolve the concerns of the FCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMany U.K. regulatory matters are subject to increased uncertainty because supervision of the U.K. consumer credit regime has recently been transferred to the FCA, which previously did not hold such authority.\nSupervision of our U.K. business was transferred from the OFT to the FCA in April 2014. The FCA applies more prescriptive regulations to our U.K. operations, as opposed to the previous regime. The FCA is responsible for determining whether we will receive full authorization to continue providing consumer credit and perform related activities and whether we will continue to hold our existing interim permission. Because the FCA\u2019s authority over consumer credit is new, the FCA\u2019s practices regarding supervisory matters and other matters relevant to us are subject to further development and change. The FCA is not bound by the previous practices of the OFT and is operating under a different legal framework and regime, and the FCA will apply its supervisory powers and interpret relevant concepts more stringently than such previous practices. This may adversely affect our ability to anticipate the FCA\u2019s expectations or interpretations in our interaction with the FCA.\nCompetition regulators in the United Kingdom completed a review of our industry and , as a result of the findings, the FCA is likely to require lenders to implement additional changes to their operations, which could have a negative effect on our operations in the United Kingdom.\nIn June 2013, the OFT referred the payday lending industry in the United Kingdom to the Competition Commission, which is now the Competition & Markets Authority, or the CMA, for a market investigation. The CMA gathered data from industry participants, including us, in connection with its review of the U.K. payday lending industry to determine whether certain features of the payday lending industry prevent, restrict or distort competition (which is also referred to as having an adverse effect on competition) and, if so, what remedial action should be taken.\nOn June 11, 2014, the CMA released a provisional findings report in which it indicated that it believes that many payday lenders fail to compete on price and indicated that it will look at potential ways to increase price competition. The CMA also announced the expansion of its review of the payday lending industry to include lead generators. The CMA announced its provisional decision on remedies on October 9, 2014, and published its final report on February 24, 2015. The CMA will order online lenders to provide details of their products on at least one price comparison website which is authorized by the FCA. The CMA will also order online and storefront lenders to provide existing customers with a summary of their cost of borrowing. The CMA will publish an order within six months from the date of this report with its requirement regarding the price comparison website and the borrowing summaries. In addition, the CMA recommended that the FCA take steps to improve the disclosure of late fees and other additional charges, help customers compare competing loan products without unduly affecting their ability to access credit, improve real-time data sharing between lenders and credit reference agencies and ensure that lead generators explain how they operate much more clearly to customers.\nIt is expected that the FCA will consult in the summer of 2015 on the measures to be introduced in response to the CMA\u2019s recommendations and will likely publish its standards in late 2015 or early 2016, with the changes becoming effective by the end of 2016. The CMA will work closely with the FCA to implement the recommendations.\nThe remedies that are likely to be implemented by the FCA could have a negative effect on our operations in the United Kingdom.\nOur advertising and marketing materials and disclosures have been and continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United Kingdom.\nIn the jurisdictions where we operate, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to regulation under various industry standards, consumer protection laws, and other applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with the consumer lending industry as a whole (see \u201c- The consumer lending industry continues to be targeted by new laws or regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the short-term consumer lending products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations\u201d above), our advertising and marketing materials have come under increased scrutiny. In the United Kingdom, for example, consumer credit firms are subject to the financial promotions regime set out in the FSMA (Financial Promotions) Order 2005 and specific rules in the CONC, such as the inclusion of a risk warning on certain advertising materials. The FCA has also decided to adopt certain elements of industry codes as FCA rules on a case by case basis. Our advertising and marketing materials in the United Kingdom are reviewed both by the FCA and the Advertising Standards Authority. We have in some cases been ordered to withdraw, amend or add disclosures to such materials, or have done so voluntarily in response to inquiries or complaints. In addition, on February 24, 2015, the FCA issued a consultation paper that, among other things, proposes a requirement that providers of high-cost short-term credit include a risk warning in all financial promotions. The FCA has requested comments on the proposals by May 6, 2015. Going forward, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to advertise and market our business in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in a manner we consider effective. Any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business in Australia has become less profitable due to compliance with new regulations there, and if our new product offering is not sustainable, this could require us to exit the Australian market.\nIn Australia we must comply with the responsible lending conduct obligations under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act (2010), which was amended in 2012. The amendment includes limitations on permissible fees and interest charged on certain consumer loans, including consumer loans made by us. We have altered the product we offer in Australia, and it is less profitable than the product previously offered. If the reduction in profitability is such that our product offering is not sustainable, we may need to exit Australia if the product cannot be further modified in a way that retains our profitability in that country.\nSignificant changes in international laws or regulations or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil or China, or any other country in which we intend to begin operations, could affect our operations in these countries.\nWe offer or arrange online consumer loans to customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and the United Kingdom. Australia and the United Kingdom have recently increased regulation of our industry as well as demonstrated an increasing interest in legislation or regulations that could further regulate or restrict the consumer loan products we offer. See the risk factors above for recent U.K. and Australian regulatory activity.\nSignificant changes in international laws or regulations or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China or the United Kingdom could restrict our ability to sustain or expand our operations in these countries. Similarly, a significant change in laws, regulations or overall treatment (including an interpretation or application of such laws and regulations not anticipated when exploring or initiating business) or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of any other country in which we may decide to explore business could also materially adversely affect our prospects and could restrict our ability to initiate a pilot program or develop a pilot program into full business operations.\nWe have previously ceased business in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory restrictions and, if we are forced to exit many key jurisdictions due to regulatory restrictions, it could adversely affect our business as a whole.\nIn the past we have ceased business in, restricted our operations in, or chosen not to begin business in, certain jurisdictions due to regulatory restrictions which render our operations impermissible, unprofitable or impractical. In addition, because we are in some cases subject to state/provincial and local regulation in addition to federal/national regulation, we may restrict or discontinue business in certain jurisdictions within countries where we are otherwise active. For example, as of December 31, 2014, we did not conduct business in 15 U.S. states or in the District of Columbia because we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate in those jurisdictions due to specific statutory or regulatory restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings or caps on the fees that may be charged.\nThe adoption of state regulatory measures cannot be predicted, but we expect that other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on our consumer loan products in the future, which could affect our operations in such states. Legislation or regulations targeting or otherwise directly affecting our products and services have been introduced or adopted in a number of states over the last few years, and we are currently monitoring proposed legislation or regulations in Alabama, Hawaii, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Legal Proceedings-U.S. State Regulation.\u201d\nIf we are forced to exit many key jurisdictions due to such concerns, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find suitably attractive additional business opportunities elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRegulators and payment processors are scrutinizing certain online lenders\u2019 access to the Automated Clearing House system to disburse and collect loan proceeds and repayments, and any interruption or limitation on our ability to access this critical system would materially adversely affect our business.\nWhen making loans in the United States, we use the ACH system to deposit loan proceeds into our customers\u2019 bank accounts, and our business, including loans made through the CSO programs, depends on the ACH system to collect amounts due by withdrawing funds from our customers\u2019 bank accounts when we have obtained authorization to do so from the customer. Our ACH transactions are processed by banks, and if these banks cease to provide ACH processing services, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative ACH processors are not available.\nIt has been reported that actions by the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Justice Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, and certain state regulators, referred to as Operation Choke Point, appear to be intended to discourage banks and ACH payment processors from providing access to the ACH system for certain short-term consumer loan providers that they believe are operating illegally, cutting off their access to the ACH system to either debit or credit customer accounts (or both). According to published reports, the Justice Department issued subpoenas to banks and payment processors and the FDIC and other regulators were reported to have used bank oversight examinations to discourage banks from providing access to the ACH system to certain online lenders. In August 2013, the Department of Financial Services of the State of New York, or the NYDFS, sent letters to approximately 35 online short-term consumer loan companies (which did not include us as we do not offer consumer loans in New York) demanding that they cease and desist offering illegal payday loans to New York consumers and also sent letters to over 100 banks, as well as the National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA (which oversees the ACH network), requesting that they work with the NYDFS to cut off ACH system access to New York customer accounts for illegal payday lenders. NACHA, in turn, requested that its participants review origination activity for these 35 online short-term consumer loan companies and advise NACHA whether it had terminated these lenders\u2019 access to the ACH system or, if not, the basis for not doing so. NACHA also requested that participants review ACH origination activities related to other online loan companies and to terminate any ACH system access that would violate NACHA rules, which would include, according to NACHA, any authorizations to use the ACH system to pay illegal short-term consumer loans that are unenforceable under state law. Maryland\u2019s Division of Financial Regulation has also been reported to have taken steps to stop banks in Maryland from processing illegal payday loans in its state, and the California Department of Business Oversight is reported to have similarly directed state-licensed banks and credit unions to monitor transactions with any unlicensed lenders.\nThis heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, the FDIC and other regulators has caused banks and ACH payment processors to cease doing business with consumer lenders who are operating legally, without regard to whether those lenders are complying with applicable laws, simply to avoid the risk of heightened scrutiny or even litigation. In June 2014, Community Financial Services of America, a trade association representing short-term lenders and a major payday lender filed a lawsuit against three U.S. banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Comptroller of the Currency, alleging that the federal regulators are improperly causing banks to terminate business relationships with payday lenders. The complaint seeks a declaration that the agencies have acted wrongfully and seeks an injunction barring the agencies from certain actions or informally pressuring banks to terminate their relationship with payday lenders. The lawsuit says that Bank of America Corp., Capital Financial One Corp., Fifth Third Bancorp, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and many smaller banks have terminated their relationships with payday lenders.\nOur access to the ACH system could be impaired as a result of this operation by regulators to cut off the ACH system to payday lenders or the NACHA rule amendments. The limited number of financial institutions we depend on may choose to discontinue providing ACH processing and similar services to us. If our access to the ACH system is impaired, we may find it difficult or impossible to continue some or all of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain access to needed services on favorable terms, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative processors are not available.\nIn addition, NACHA has certain operating rules that govern the use of the ACH system. Amendments to the rules were adopted by NACHA\u2019s members in August 2014 and will become effective on various dates in 2015 and 2016. These amendments will, among other things (1) establish certain ACH return rate levels, including an overall ACH return rate level of 15% of the originator\u2019s debit entries (and if any of the specified return rate levels are exceeded, the origination practices and activities of the originator would be subject to a new preliminary inquiry process by NACHA), (2) enhance limitations on certain ACH reinitiation activities, (3) impose fees on certain unauthorized ACH returns and (4) allow for increased flexibility in how a NACHA rules violation investigation can be initiated, which does not change the rules enforcement process, but defines additional circumstances under which NACHA may initiate a risk investigation or rules enforcement proceeding based on the origination of unauthorized entries. The revised amendments provide clarification that certain industries deal with customers who are more likely to experience an insufficient funds scenario and that the review of an originator with returns in excess of certain of the specified thresholds would take into account the originator\u2019s business model in conjunction with its ACH origination practices. As a result of these amendments, our access to the ACH system could be restricted, our ACH costs could increase and we may need to make changes to our business practices.\nThe failure to comply with debt collection regulations could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business.\nThe FDCPA regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection communications, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions also regulate debt collection. For example, in the United Kingdom, due to new rules under the CONC we have made adjustments to some of our business practices, including our collections processes, which could possibly result in lower collections on loans made by us and has resulted in a decrease in the number of new customers that we are able to approve. In addition, the concerns expressed to us by the OFT and the FCA relate in part to debt collection. We could be subject to fines, written orders or other penalties if we, or parties working on our behalf, are determined to have violated the FDCPA, the CONC or analogous state or international laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe use lead providers and marketing affiliates to assist us in obtaining new customers, and if lead providers or marketing affiliates do not comply with an increasing number of applicable laws and regulations, or if our ability to use such lead providers or marketing affiliates is otherwise impaired, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on third parties, referred to as lead providers (or lead generators) and marketing affiliates, as a source of new customers. Our marketing affiliates place our advertisements on their websites that direct potential customers to our websites. Generally, lead providers operate, and also work with their own marketing affiliates who operate, separate websites to attract prospective customers and then sell those \u201cleads\u201d to online lenders. As a result, the success of our business depends substantially on the willingness and ability of lead providers or marketing affiliates to provide us customer leads at acceptable prices.\nIf regulatory oversight of lead providers or marketing affiliates is increased, through the implementation of new laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates could be restricted or eliminated. For example, during 2013, the State of California began enforcing its short-term lending statute to require lead providers to be licensed in order to provide leads to licensed lenders. As a result, we have discontinued using lead providers to generate leads for short-term consumer loans in California. In April 2014, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois filed a lawsuit against a lead provider, alleging that the lead provider offered and arranged payday loans without a license. As a result, we discontinued the use of lead providers in Illinois. While these discontinuations did not have a material adverse effect on us, we expect that other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers and potentially on marketing affiliates in the future, and if other states adopt similar restrictions, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates in those states would also be interrupted.\nIn addition, the CFPB has indicated its intention to examine compliance with federal laws and regulations by lead providers and to scrutinize the flow of non-public, private consumer information between lead providers and lead buyers, such as us. We also expect that the ongoing regulatory review of consumer lending in the United Kingdom may lead to increased restrictions on the operations and/or use of lead providers. On December 1, 2014, the FCA published a policy statement which set out its concerns about the practices of some credit brokers which charge upfront fees to consumers. It also introduced new rules targeted at ensuring that key\nfeatures of brokers\u2019 relationships with consumers are transparent, which came into effect on January 2, 2015. In addition, in its February 24, 2015 final report regarding the payday industry, the CMA recommended that the FCA take steps to ensure that lead generators explain how they operate much more clearly to customers, including that lead generators be required to state that application details are referred to the lender that offers the lead generator the best commercial deal rather than to the lender that offers the most suitable loan for the customer\u2019s needs. That same day, the FCA issued a consultation paper that invites comments regarding whether to retain or modify the rules on credit broking that were introduced on December 1, 2014 and whether to introduce additional rules. The FCA has requested comments by May 6, 2015.\nLead providers\u2019 or marketing affiliates\u2019 failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any changes in laws or regulations applicable to lead providers or marketing affiliates\u2019 or changes in the interpretation or implementation of such laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business and could increase negative perceptions of our business and industry. Additionally, the use of lead providers and marketing affiliates could subject us to additional regulatory cost and expense. If our ability to use lead generators or marketing affiliates were to be impaired, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe use of personal data used in credit underwriting is highly regulated.\nIn the United States the FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Compliance with the FCRA and related laws and regulations concerning consumer reports has recently been under regulatory scrutiny. The FCRA requires us to provide a Notice of Adverse Action to a loan applicant when we deny an application for credit, which, among other things, informs the applicant of the action taken regarding the credit application and the specific reasons for the denial of credit. The FCRA also requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a consumer reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. Historically, the FTC has played a key role in the implementation, oversight, enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has primary supervisory, regulatory and enforcement authority of FCRA issues, although the FTC also retains its enforcement role regarding the FCRA but shares that role in many respects with the CFPB. The CFPB has taken a more active approach than the FTC, including with respect to regulation, enforcement and supervision of the FCRA. Changes in the regulation, enforcement or supervision of the FCRA may materially affect our business if new regulations or interpretations by the CFPB or the FTC require us to materially alter the manner in which we use personal data in our credit underwriting.\nIn the United Kingdom, we are also subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1988, or the DPA, and are required to be fully registered as a data-controller under the DPA. We are also required to be certified under the European Union Safe Harbor provisions, which allow European Union data to be passed to non-European Union countries.\nThe oversight of the FCRA by both the CFPB and the FTC and any related investigation or enforcement activities or our failure to comply with the DPA may have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operations, our mode and manner of conducting business and our financial results.\nNegative public perception of our business could cause demand for our products to significantly decrease.\nIn recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on short-term and high-cost consumer loans. Such consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the annual percentage rate for this type of consumer loan, which is compared unfavorably to the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with top-tier credit histories. The fees and/or interest charged by us and others in the industry attract media publicity about the industry and can be perceived as controversial. If the negative characterization of these types of loans becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for any or all of the consumer loan products that we offer could significantly decrease, which could materially affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of loans is accepted by legislators and regulators, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to short-term loans or other consumer loan products that we offer that could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nIn addition, our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters-even if related to seemingly isolated incidents, or even if related to practices not specific to short-term loans, such as debt collection-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could significantly decrease the demand for our products, could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have been and are currently subject to lawsuits (including purported class actions) that could cause us to incur substantial expenditures, generate adverse publicity and could significantly impair our business, force us to cease doing business in one or more jurisdictions or cause us to cease offering or alter one or more products. We are also likely to be subject to further litigation in the future. An adverse ruling in or a settlement of any current or future litigation against us or another lender could cause us to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, forego collection of the principal amount of loans, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties and/or modify or terminate our operations in particular jurisdictions.\nDefense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. We and others are also subject to regulatory proceedings, and we could suffer losses as a result of interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations in those regulatory proceedings, even if we are not a party to those proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rule-making or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable.\nWe include arbitration provisions in our consumer loan agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action liability. Our arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. We take the position that the arbitration provisions in our consumer loan agreements, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject us to additional litigation, including additional class action litigation.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and also certain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to study consumer arbitration and report to the U.S. Congress, and it authorized the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent with the results of its study. In March 2015, the CFPB released its final report on consumer arbitration that indicates it may propose rules that prohibit or limit the use of arbitration provisions in consumer loan agreements. Any rule adopted by the CFPB would apply to arbitration agreements entered into more than six months after the final rule becomes effective (and not to prior arbitration agreements).\nAny judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers could significantly increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to us to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt our operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nA portion of our short-term consumer loan and installment loan revenue depends in part on the willingness and ability of unaffiliated third-party lenders, through the CSO programs, to make loans to customers. We also utilize many other third parties to provide services to facilitate lending, loan underwriting and payment processing in our online lending consumer channels. In addition, we rely on third party lenders in connection with our pilot programs that we recently launched in Brazil and China. The loss of the relationship with any of these third parties, and an inability to replace them or the failure of these third parties to maintain quality and consistency in their programs or services or to have the ability to provide their products and services, could cause us to lose customers and substantially decrease the revenue and earnings of our business. Our revenue and earnings could also be adversely affected if any of those third-party providers make material changes to the products or services that we rely on. We also use third parties to support and maintain certain of our communication systems and information systems. If a third-party provider fails to provide its products or services, makes material changes to such products and services, does not maintain its quality and consistency or fails to have the ability to provide its products and services, our operations could be disrupted. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems, as well as the ability of such systems to support compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our employees\u2019 ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as internet support, call center activities, and processing and servicing of our loans. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which our internet operations and other technology infrastructure are based, such as a power outage, a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of our ability to underwrite, approve and process loans, provide customer service, perform collections activities, or perform other necessary business functions. Any such interruption could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, our systems and those of third parties on whom we rely must consistently be capable of compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and timely modification to comply with new or amended requirements. For example, we believe that the federal Military Lending Act compliance issues involved in the CFPB\u2019s Consent Order were related in part to system errors. Any such systems problems going forward could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows and could impair or prohibit our ability to continue current operations.\nDecreased demand for our products and specialty financial services and our failure to adapt to such decrease could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, such as regulatory restrictions that reduce customer access to particular products, the availability of competing or alternative products or changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions. Should we fail to adapt to a significant change in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products, our revenue could decrease significantly. Even if we make adaptations or introduce new products to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time. In particular, we have changed, and will continue to change, some of our operations and the products we offer. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPotential union activities could have an adverse effect on our relationship with our workforce.\nNone of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by an employee union. Occasionally we experience union organizing activities. In addition, on April 14, 2015, the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s new representation election rules become effective, which may make it easier for unions to organize. If our employees become represented by an employee union or become subject to a collective bargaining agreement, it may make it more difficult for us to manage our business and to attract and retain new employees and may increase our cost of doing business. Having our employees become represented by an employee union, having a collective bargaining agreement or having additional requirements related to our employees imposed on us could result in work stoppages and higher employee costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nIf our allowance for losses and liability for estimated losses on third-party lender-owned consumer loans is not adequate to absorb losses or if we do not successfully manage our credit risk for unsecured loans, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nAs more fully described under Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report, we utilize a variety of underwriting criteria, monitor the performance of our loan portfolios and maintain either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans (including fees and interest) at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the receivables portfolio and expected losses from loans guaranteed under the CSO programs. The allowance deducted from the carrying value of consumer loans was $64.9 million at December 31, 2014, and the liability for estimated losses on third-party lender-owned consumer loans was $1.6 million at December 31, 2014. These reserves are estimates, and if actual loan losses are materially greater than our reserves, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not successfully manage credit risk for our unsecured loans through our loan underwriting, we could incur substantial credit losses due to customers being unable to repay their loans. Any failure to manage credit risk could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to impairment risk.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had goodwill totaling $255.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets, all of which represents assets capitalized in connection with acquisitions and business combinations. Accounting for goodwill requires significant management estimates and judgment. Events may occur in the future, and we may not realize the value of our goodwill. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also lead to our inability to comply with certain covenants in our financing documents, which could cause a default under those agreements.\nWe are subject to anticorruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions laws, and our failure to comply therewith, particularly as we continue to expand internationally, could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAnticorruption Laws. We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, such policies or procedures may not work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future.\nWe are subject to other anti-corruption laws, such as the Bribery Act, which prohibit the giving or receiving of a bribe to any person, including but not limited to public officials, and make failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations a criminal offense. This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribes anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act is applicable to businesses that operate in the United Kingdom such as us. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not allow certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the FCPA.\nOther countries in which we operate, including Australia, Canada, China and Brazil, and other countries where we intend to operate also have anticorruption laws, which we are or will be subject to.\nIf we are not in compliance with the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAnti-Money Laundering Laws. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and related compliance obligations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In the United States, the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act require us to maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. The program must include: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; (2) designation of a compliance officer; (3) an ongoing employee training program; and (4) an independent audit function to test the program. Furthermore, certain of our subsidiaries are registered as money services businesses with the U.S. Treasury Department and must re-register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, at least every two years. If we are not in compliance with U.S. or other anti-money laundering laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of anti-money laundering laws by U.S. or international authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the United Kingdom, we are also subject to specific anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing requirements that require us to develop and maintain anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing policies and procedures, including reporting suspicious activity to the Serious Organised Crime Agency pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000.\nIn Australia, we are also subject to specific anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing requirements that require us to develop and maintain anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing policies and procedures, including: (i) the appointment of a compliance officer; (ii) regular review to identify significant changes in money laundering/terrorist financing risk; (iii) regular independent review; (iv) reporting suspicious matters to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or the AUSTRAC; and (v) consideration of AUSTRAC feedback.\nEconomic Sanctions Laws. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. In particular, the United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals,\u201d such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual, entity or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity or country has an interest. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Other countries in which we operate also maintain economic and financial sanctions regimes. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. If we are not in compliance with OFAC regulations and other economic and financial sanctions regulations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of OFAC regulations or other economic sanctions by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur continued international expansion could increase the risk of violations of FCPA, the Bribery Act, anti-money laundering laws, OFAC regulations, or similar applicable laws and regulations in the future.\nIncreased competition from banks, credit card companies, other consumer lenders, and other entities offering similar financial products and services could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have many competitors. Our principal competitors are consumer loan companies, CSOs, online lenders, credit card companies, consumer finance companies, pawnshops and other financial institutions that offer similar financial services. Many other financial institutions or other businesses that do not now offer products or services directed toward our traditional customer base, many of whom may be much larger than us, could begin doing so. Significant increases in the number and size of competitors for our business could result in a decrease in the number of loans that we fund, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings in these categories.\nCompetitors of our business may operate, or begin to operate, under business models less focused on legal and regulatory compliance, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Some of our U.S. competitors operate using other business models, including a \u201csingle-state model\u201d where the lender is generally licensed in one state and follows only the laws and regulations of that state regardless of the state in which the customer resides and a \u201ctribal model\u201d where the lender follows the laws of a Native American tribe regardless of the state in which the customer resides. Competitors using these models may be able to lend in jurisdictions where we do not and may have higher revenue per customer and significantly less burdensome compliance requirements, among other advantages. Additionally, negative perceptions about these models could cause legislators or regulators to pursue additional industry restrictions that could affect the business model under which we operate. To the extent that these models or other new lending models gain acceptance among consumers, small businesses and investors or that they face less onerous regulatory restrictions than we do, we may be unable to replicate their business practices or otherwise compete with them effectively, which could cause demand for our products to decline substantially. We may be unable to compete successfully against any or all of our current or future competitors. As a result, we could lose market share and our revenue could decline, thereby affecting our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operations. Any such changes in our competition could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our officers, and if we are not able to attract and retain qualified officers, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on our officers, which are a relatively small group of individuals. Many members of the senior management team have significant industry experience, and we believe that our senior management would be difficult to replace, if necessary. Because the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified officers or candidates. In addition, increasing regulations on and negative publicity about the consumer financial services industry could affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified officers, it could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur international operations subject us to foreign exchange risk.\nWe are subject to the risk of unexpected changes in foreign currency exchange rates by virtue of our loans to residents of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and the United Kingdom. In 2014, 41.4% of our total revenue was derived from our international operations. Our results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and United Kingdom businesses are denominated in their respective currencies and are, as a result, exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, gross profit and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.\nA sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce demand for our products and services and result in reduced earnings.\nA sustained deterioration in the economy could cause deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolios. An economic slowdown could result in a decreased number of loans being made to customers due to higher unemployment or an increase in loan defaults in our loan products. During an economic slowdown, we could be required to tighten our underwriting standards, which would likely reduce loan balances, and we could face more difficulty in collecting defaulted loans, which could lead to an increase in loan losses.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and analytics or keep up with that of our competitors.\nThe success of our business depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software, fraud defenses, underwriting algorithms and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information, detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors could, without violating our proprietary rights, develop technologies that are as good as or better than our technology. Our failure to protect our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights or to develop technologies that are as good as our competitors\u2019 could put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. Any such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering certain products or product features, acquire licenses, which may not be available at a commercially reasonable price or at all, or modify our products, product features, processes or websites while we develop non-infringing substitutes.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our technology platform and plan to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, potentially including our valuable proprietary code, or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform, any of which could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of consumers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We are entirely dependent on the secure operation of our websites and systems as well as the operation of the internet generally. While we have incurred no material cyber-attacks or security breaches to date, a number of other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or both. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, our security measures may not provide absolute security. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the company such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications or expand into new countries. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our applicants provide personal information, including bank account information when applying for loans. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach of our systems or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of consumers\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services or support to us could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact our customers and our business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue.\nAny of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf internet search engine providers change their methodologies for organic rankings or paid search results, or our organic rankings or paid search results decline for other reasons, our new customer growth or volume from returning customers could decline.\nOur new customer acquisition marketing and our returning customer relationship management is partly dependent on search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! to direct a significant amount of traffic to our desktop and mobile websites via organic ranking and paid search advertising. Our competitors\u2019 paid search activities, pay per click or search engine marketing may result in their sites receiving higher paid search results than ours and significantly increasing the cost of such advertising for us.\nOur paid search activities may not produce (and in the past have not always produced) the desired results. Internet search engines often revise their methodologies, which could adversely affect our organic rankings or paid search results, resulting in a decline in our new customer growth or existing customer retention; difficulty for our customers in using our web and mobile sites; more successful organic rankings, paid search results or tactical execution efforts for our competitors than for us; a slowdown in overall growth in our customer base and the loss of existing customers; and higher costs for acquiring returning customers, which could adversely impact our business. In addition, search engines could implement policies that restrict the ability of consumer finance companies such as us to advertise their services and products, which could preclude companies in our industry from appearing in a favorable location or any location in the organic rankings or paid search results when certain search terms are used by the consumer. Our online marketing efforts are also susceptible to actions by third parties that negatively impact our search results such as spam link attacks, which are often referred to as \u201cblack hat\u201d tactics. Our sites have experienced meaningful fluctuations in organic rankings and paid search results in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our web and mobile sites could harm our business and operating results.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could adversely impact our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur services and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors and similar events. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. Any of these events could cause consumer confidence to decrease, which could result in a decreased number of loans being made to customers. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to keep up with the rapid changes in e-commerce and the uses and regulation of the internet could harm our business.\nThe business of providing products and services such as ours over the internet is dynamic and relatively new. We must keep pace with rapid technological change, consumer use habits, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, and governmental regulation and taxation, and each of these factors could adversely impact our business. In addition, concerns about fraud, computer security and privacy and/or other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting or continuing to use the internet as a medium of commerce. In countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where e-commerce generally has been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our online financial services is relatively high, acquiring new customers for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to conduct their financial services transactions. If these consumers prove to be less profitable than our previous customers, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and internationally that involve user privacy issues, data protection, advertising, marketing, disclosures, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and online payment services. The introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations. In addition, international data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations, which can be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change, and the U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving e-commerce industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current or past policies and practices. A number of proposals are pending before federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. For example, the European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that may also include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas such as privacy. In addition, some countries are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, would increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, the expansion into new markets, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices or pay fines, penalties or other damages.\nGrowth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure and could be costly.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in our business. This growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Expanding our products or entering into new jurisdictions with new or existing products can be costly and require significant management time and attention. Additionally, as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity and our product offerings increase, we will need to enhance and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of enhanced solutions, features and functionality. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, develop and enhance our legal and compliance controls and processes, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense and is particularly intense for technology and analytics professionals. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources or more attractive compensation mixes than we have had. Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. Failure to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nNew top level domain names may allow the entrance of new competitors or dilution of our brands, which may reduce the value of our domain name assets.\nWe have invested heavily in promoting our brands, including our website addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the entity responsible for administering internet protocol addresses, has introduced, and has proposed the introduction of, additional new domain name suffixes in different formats, many of which may be more attractive than the formats held by us and which may allow the entrance of new competitors at limited cost. It may also permit other operators to register websites with addresses similar to ours, causing customer confusion and dilution of our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any defensive domain registration strategy or attempts to protect our trademarks or brands could become a large and recurring expense and may not be successful.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings and markets and grow our business in response to changing customer demands, regulatory environments, technologies and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may expand our offerings through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the business that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us. In addition, we may issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or may expose us to additional material liabilities. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our operating results.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain will vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and management\u2019s decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that could result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our financial statements and certain tax positions taken by us require the judgment of management, and we could be subject to risks associated with these judgments or could be adversely affected by the implementation of new, or changes in the interpretation of existing, accounting principles, financial reporting requirements or tax rules.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In addition, management\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Management\u2019s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under Accounting Standards Codification 740-10-25, Income Taxes . Upon audit, if the ultimate determination of the taxes owed by us is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be required to make certain additional tax payments, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and its interpretations are subject to change over time. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to restate historical financial reporting.\nOur U.S. short-term loan business is seasonal in nature, which causes our revenue and earnings to fluctuate.\nOur U.S. short-term loan business is affected by fluctuating demand for our products and services and fluctuating collection rates throughout the year. Demand for our short-term consumer loan products in the United States has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the holiday season, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers\u2019 receipt of income tax refunds. Typically, our cost of revenue for our short-term consumer loan products in the United States, which represents our loan loss provision, is lowest as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers\u2019 receipt of income tax refunds, and increases as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of each year. This seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year. If our revenue or collections were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our ability to service debt and meet our other liquidity requirements may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Separation and the Distribution\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nPrior to the distribution, Cash America received a private letter ruling from the IRS, or the IRS Ruling, to the effect that the retention by Cash America of up to 20% of Enova\u2019s stock will not be in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the retention of the Enova stock was in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings that we or Cash America have made or provided to the IRS are not correct. If the retention was in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax, then the distribution could ultimately be determined to be taxable, and Cash America would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of our common stock distributed to Cash America shareholders on the distribution date over Cash America\u2019s tax basis in such shares of our common stock. Moreover, Cash America could incur significant U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable. Under U.S. Treasury regulations each member of the Cash America consolidated group at the time of the distribution (including us and our subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the entire amount of any resulting U.S. federal income tax liability.\nCash America has also received an opinion of tax counsel that the distribution will be treated as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355(a) of the Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the distribution that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. Like the IRS Ruling, the opinion is based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel\u2019s conclusions. If, notwithstanding the receipt of the IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS were to determine the distribution to be taxable, Cash America would recognize a substantial tax liability.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into in connection with the separation and distribution allocates the responsibility for taxes for periods prior to the distribution among Cash America and us. For periods prior to the distribution, generally we are required to reimburse Cash America with respect to any U.S. federal, state or local or international income taxes reportable on returns that include us that are attributable to us. We are responsible for filing and paying all U.S. federal, state or local or international income taxes that are reportable on returns that only include us. We and Cash America are responsible for certain non-income taxes, such as property, excise, sales and use taxes, attributable to each company and its respective subsidiaries.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we are generally required to indemnify Cash America against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our stock or assets, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect. For a more detailed discussion, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report. Our indemnification obligations to Cash America and its officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify Cash America or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits from our separation from Cash America, and our historical and pro forma consolidated financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future prospects. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent, publicly traded company.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits we expect from our separation from Cash America. In addition, we will incur significant costs, including those described below, which may exceed our estimates, and we will incur some negative effects from our separation from Cash America, including loss of access to some of the financial, managerial and professional resources from which we have benefited in the past.\nThe historical consolidated financial information included in this report for periods prior to consummation of the separation and distribution may not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. The costs and expenses reflected in such historical consolidated financial information for periods prior to the separation and distribution include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Cash America, including executive oversight, insurance and risk management, government relations, internal audit, treasury, licensing, and to a limited extent finance, accounting, tax, legal, human resources, compensation and benefits, compliance and support for certain information systems related to financial reporting that may be different from the comparable expenses that we would have incurred had we operated as a stand-alone company. We have not adjusted our historical consolidated financial information for periods prior to the separation and distribution to reflect changes that will occur in our cost structure and operations as a result of our transition to becoming a stand-alone public company, including changes in our employee base, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with SEC reporting and the NYSE requirements. Therefore, our historical consolidated financial information for periods prior to the separation and distribution may not necessarily be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be in the future. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe one-time and ongoing costs of the distribution may be greater than we expected.\nWe are incurring costs in connection with our transition to being a stand-alone public company that relate primarily to accounting, tax, legal and other professional costs; compensation, such as modifications to certain incentive awards upon completion of the distribution; recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring additional senior management personnel; and costs to separate assets and information systems. In addition, we have already incurred costs of approximately $16.3 million in connection with obtaining independent financing that we will need in order to operate as a separate stand-alone company. These costs may be greater than anticipated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have no history operating as an independent public company. We will incur significant costs to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent public company and meet our legal and regulatory compliance requirements. We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company and meet our legal and regulatory compliance requirements.\nWe have historically used Cash America\u2019s corporate infrastructure to support some of our business functions, including services related to executive oversight, insurance and risk management, government relations, internal audit, treasury, licensing, and to a limited extent finance, accounting, tax, legal, human resources, compensation and benefits, compliance and support for certain information systems related to financial reporting. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure were spread among all of Cash America\u2019s businesses. Following the separation and after the expiration of the transition arrangements described below, we will no longer have access to Cash America\u2019s infrastructure, and we will need to establish our own. We have begun incurring costs to establish the necessary infrastructure and expect to continue to incur such costs.\nCash America is only contractually obligated to provide to us those transition services specified in the Transition Services Agreement and the other agreements we entered into with Cash America in connection with the separation and the distribution. The expiration date of the Transition Services Agreement varies by service provided, but generally is no longer than 12 months from the distribution date. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Transition Services Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report for a description of the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services or other benefits that Cash America previously provided to us. Upon the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement or other agreements, many of the services that are covered in such agreements will be provided internally or by unaffiliated third parties. We expect that, in some instances, we will incur higher costs to obtain such services than we incurred prior to the separation and the distribution or under the terms of such agreements. If Cash America does not effectively perform the services that are called for under the Transition Services Agreement and other agreements, we may not be able to operate our business effectively, and our profitability may decline. After the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement and the other agreements, we may be unable to replace the services specified in such agreements in a timely manner or on comparable terms.\nFurthermore, as discussed under \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d under the captions \u201c- Our business is highly regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, our business could be adversely affected ,\u201d \u201c- The consumer lending industry continues to be targeted by new laws or regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the short-term consumer lending products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations ,\u201d \u201c- We are subject to a Consent Order issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and any noncompliance would materially adversely affect our business \u201c and \u201c- The United Kingdom has imposed, and continues to impose, increased regulation of the short-term high-cost credit industry with the stated expectation that some firms will exit the market ,\u201d we face significant ongoing legal and regulatory compliance requirements arising from the heavily regulated industry in which we operate, which continues to be targeted by legislators and regulators, and also from compliance with enforcement actions, orders and agreements issued by applicable regulators, such as the November 2013 Consent Order issued by the CFPB. In particular, the Consent Order requires us to allocate resources to ensure that we have a compliance function that is commensurate with our size, complexity, product lines, and business operations to ensure the implementation of an adequate compliance program, including appropriate staffing levels with qualified and experienced personnel. If, as a stand-alone company, we are unable to maintain these resources in a timely manner or on comparable terms, we may face an increased risk of noncompliance with the Consent Order and other regulatory requirements or additional enforcement actions. These risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nIn connection with our separation from Cash America, we and Cash America have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to Cash America, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and Cash America\u2019s indemnity could be insufficient or Cash America could be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Cash America, Cash America agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities related to tax, regulatory, litigation or other liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Cash America for certain similar liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Separation and Distribution Agreement\u201d of Part III, Item 13 of this report. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Cash America are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Cash America has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from Cash America could be insufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or Cash America may be unable to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Cash America any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves and could suffer reputational risks if the losses are related to regulatory, litigation or other matters. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, will be expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nWe have historically operated as a subsidiary of Cash America and have not been subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements of a stand-alone public company. As a stand-alone public company, we are required to file annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. We will need to prepare and timely file financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the NYSE and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could impose significant new compliance costs and obligations upon us. The changes necessitated by becoming a stand-alone public company require a commitment of additional resources and management oversight which will increase our operating costs. These changes also place significant additional demands on our finance, accounting and legal staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a stand-alone public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. As a stand-alone public company, we are required, among other things, to:\nprepare and file periodic and current reports, and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and the NYSE;\ndefine and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors and its committees;\ninstitute comprehensive investor relations and internal audit functions and continue to enhance our compliance function; and\nsubject to applicable phase-in requirements, evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nIn particular, beginning with the year ending December 31, 2015, we will be required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, beginning with the year ending December 31, 2015. In addition we are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (at such time as it is required to do so), investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe are unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, and such restrictions could be significant.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement prohibits us from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to cause the distribution to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the IRS Ruling or opinions of counsel received by us or Cash America. In particular, for two years after the distribution, we may not:\n\u00b7\nenter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction involving the acquisition, issuance, repurchase or change of ownership of our capital stock, or options or other rights in respect of our capital stock, subject to certain exceptions relating to employee compensation arrangements and open market stock repurchases;\n\u00b7\ncease the active conduct of our business; or\n\u00b7\nvoluntarily dissolve, liquidate, merge or consolidate with any other person, unless we survive and the transaction otherwise complies with the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement.\nNevertheless, we are permitted to take any of the actions described above if we obtain Cash America\u2019s consent, or if we obtain a supplemental IRS private letter ruling and an opinion of counsel that is reasonably acceptable to Cash America to the effect that the action will not affect the tax-free status of the distribution. However, the receipt by us of any such consent or opinion and ruling does not relieve us of any obligation we have to indemnify Cash America for an action we take that causes the distribution to be taxable to Cash America or its shareholders.\nBecause of these restrictions, for two years after the distribution, we may be limited in the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital. Also, our indemnity obligation to Cash America may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during this two-year period in a transaction that our stockholders might consider favorable. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report.\nWe potentially could have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Cash America.\nThe agreements we entered into with Cash America in connection with the separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Software Lease and Maintenance Agreement (as described in \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Software Lease and Maintenance Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report), were negotiated in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cash America. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the separation relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and other obligations between Cash America and us. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Cash America and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America\u201d of Part III, Item 13 of this report.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Cash America.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of Cash America may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Cash America consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Cash America consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Cash America that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Cash America consolidated tax reporting group between us and Cash America. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report. However, if Cash America is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nThe separation and distribution may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe separation and distribution could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the distribution left Cash America insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Cash America intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that Cash America did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separation and distribution. If a court were to agree with such a claim, then such court could void the distribution as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or the distributed shares of our stock to Cash America, voiding our liens and claims against Cash America, or providing Cash America with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Cash America and the fair market value of the company at the time of the distribution.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. We do not know what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency. Further, a court could determine that Cash America was insolvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution of Enova common stock.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by Cash America should Cash America fail to pay or perform its retained obligations. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Separation and Distribution Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report.\nCertain members of management, directors and stockholders may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nOur management and directors and the management and directors of Cash America may own both Cash America common stock and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and Cash America\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Cash America. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and Cash America regarding the terms of the agreements governing the distribution and our relationship with Cash America thereafter or in the strategy for defending or resolving any litigation in which both Cash America and Enova are involved. These agreements include the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Software Lease and Maintenance Agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise because one of our directors, Daniel R. Feehan, is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of Cash America. Further, conflicts of interest may arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or Cash America may enter into in the future.\nWe do not have a non-competition agreement with Cash America to restrict Cash America from competing with us, and Cash America is not required to offer corporate opportunities to us.\nWe do not have any noncompetition agreement or arrangement with Cash America. Cash America is free to compete with us in any activity or line of business. Additionally, Cash America continues to offer alternative financial services and other financial services to consumers through its retail locations in markets served by us and is not restricted from reentering the online financial services business such as ours. We will not have any interest or expectancy in any business activity, opportunity, transaction or other matter in which Cash America engages or seeks to engage merely because we engage in the same or similar lines of business. In addition, Cash America will have no duty to communicate its knowledge of, or offer, any potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter to us, and Cash America is free to pursue or acquire such business opportunity, including opportunities that would be in direct competition with us.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under anticipated agreements governing our indebtedness.\nOn May 30, 2014 we issued and sold $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.75% Senior Notes, due 2021, or the Notes, in a private offering. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.75% and were sold at a discount of the principal amount thereof to yield 10.0% to maturity. All of the net proceeds from the Notes offering were paid to Cash America to repay all of our intercompany indebtedness and to pay a significant portion of a cash dividend to Cash America. In addition, we have certain registration obligations with respect to the Notes, and if we do not satisfy our obligations, we will be required to pay the holders of the Notes additional interest of 0.25% to 0.50% per annum until we satisfy our registration obligations in accordance with the terms of the related registration rights\nagreement. In addition, on May 14, 2014 we entered into a revolving credit facility, or the Credit Agreement, that provides for our unsecured revolving line of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million. Interest on the loans taken under the Credit Agreement will be charged, at our option, at either LIBOR for one week or one-, two-, three- or six-month periods, as selected by us, plus a margin varying from 2.50% to 3.75% or at the agent\u2019s base rate plus a margin varying from 1.50% to 2.75%. The margin for the Credit Agreement borrowings is dependent on our cash flow leverage ratios. We will also be required to pay a fee on the unused portion of our revolving line of credit ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% based on our cash flow leverage ratios. The revolving line of credit was undrawn as of December 31, 2014, but had outstanding standby letters of credit of $6.6 million as of such date. For additional information regarding the Notes and our Credit Agreement, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Notes\u201d and \u201c-Credit Agreement\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders, including:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent that our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and\n\u00b7\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face would increase.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness (including the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement) contain various restrictive covenants and require that we maintain certain financial ratios that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictive covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\nincur or permit certain liens to exist;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another company;\n\u00b7\nmake certain dispositions;\n\u00b7\nmake certain payments; and\n\u00b7\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of all of these covenants and restrictions, we may be:\n\u00b7\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u00b7\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u00b7\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nAny failure to comply with any of these financial and other affirmative and negative covenants could constitute an event of default under our debt agreements, entitling the lenders to, among other things, terminate future credit availability under our Credit Agreement, and/or increase the interest rate on outstanding debt, and/or accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under our\ndebt agreements. Any such default could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information concerning our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial condition and operating performance and our ability to enter into other debt financings, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. For information regarding the risks to our business that could impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, and lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nChanges in our financial condition or a potential disruption in the capital markets could reduce available capital.\nIf funds are not available from our operations and any excess cash or from our Credit Agreement, we will be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. We also expect to periodically access the debt capital markets to obtain capital to finance growth. Efficient access to the debt capital markets will be critical to our ongoing financial success; however, our future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of our earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, or overall business or industry prospects, adverse regulatory changes, a disruption to or deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward our industry by market participants. Disruptions and volatility in the capital markets may cause banks and other credit providers to restrict availability of new credit. Due to the negative bias toward our industry, commercial banks and other lenders have restricted access to available credit to participants in our industry, and we may have more limited access to commercial bank lending than other businesses. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, and a potential disruption in the capital markets may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges and this, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans. Additionally, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility, and the availability of funds is limited, third parties with whom we do business may incur increased costs or business disruption and this could adversely affect our business relationships with such third parties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, Tax Matters Agreement, Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of our preferred stock, including the number of shares, in any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter, or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our stock.\nIn addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u00b7\na separate vote of 80% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock in order for stockholders to amend the bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Cash America for certain tax related matters, and we may be unable to take certain actions. See \u201c-Risks Related to the Separation and the Distribution- We are unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, and such restrictions could be significant .\u201d We also entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement covering specified indemnification and other matters. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition of us or a disposition of our business.\nThere is no guarantee that our common stock will sustain an active trading market that will provide adequate liquidity for our common stock. In addition, the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained following the distribution. In addition, until the market has fully evaluated our business and potentially thereafter, the price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may also be influenced by many other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nchanges in federal, state or international laws and regulations affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by research analysts following our common stock or the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in the United States or international economies;\n\u00b7\nterrorist acts or wars;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic initiatives;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated sales or distributions of shares of our common stock by Cash America, as well as by our officers and directors, whether in the market or in subsequent public offerings;\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nthe other risks and uncertainties described herein.\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political, and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, or interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales or distributions of our common stock, including the sale by Cash America of the shares of our common stock that it has retained, could depress the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe shares of our common stock that Cash America distributed to its shareholders generally may be sold at any time in the public market. It is possible that some shareholders of Cash America, including possibly some of Cash America\u2019s major shareholders and index fund investors, will sell our common stock received in the distribution for various reasons (for example, if our business profile or market capitalization as an independent company does not fit their investment objectives). The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, Cash America retained a 20 percent ownership interest in our common stock. Pursuant to a Stockholder\u2019s and Registration Rights Agreement with Cash America, Cash America is required to vote such shares in proportion to the votes cast by our other stockholders and has granted a related proxy to us to vote its shares in accordance with such requirement. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements Between Us and Cash America-Stockholder\u2019s and Registration Rights Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this report. In order to not jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, Cash America is required to dispose of such retained shares (other than the shares retained for delivery under Cash America\u2019s long-term incentive plans as described in \u201cExecutive Compensation- Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2014\u201d of Part III, Item 11 of this report) of our common stock that it owns as soon as practicable and consistent with its reasons for retaining such shares, but in no event no later than two years after the distribution. Pursuant to the Stockholder\u2019s and Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed that, upon the request of Cash America, we will use our best efforts to effect the registration under applicable securities laws of the shares of common stock retained by Cash America and not otherwise registered and sold pursuant to the registration statement. We are required to pay certain expenses related to the registration of such stock. We have filed a registration statement relating to Cash America\u2019s shares, but it has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. Any disposition by Cash America, or any significant shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish research that is unfavorable about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have a limited number of analysts who are publishing research about us. In the event that one or more of our analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, demand for our stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders will need to sell their shares of common stock to receive any income or realize a return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, and are limited by the terms of the Credit Agreement and Notes. The future payment of dividends, if permitted by our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deem relevant. As a result, to receive any income or realize a return on their investment, our stockholders will need to sell their shares of common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14960, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "ENVA"}
