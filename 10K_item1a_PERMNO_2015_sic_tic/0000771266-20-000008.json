{"cik": "771266", "company": "KOPIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that, due to such material weakness, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of our most recent fiscal year, December 28, 2019. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. As discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, we had re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 29, 2018 because of a material weakness. As discussed below in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in this Form 10-K, our management concluded that, as of December 28, 2019, internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of that same material weakness. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 28, 2019, we have not had sufficient opportunity to test whether our corrective actions have remedied the material weakness, and therefore management concluded that the material weakness has not been remedied as of December 28, 2019. We are committed and are taking steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the material weakness by implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of designing and implementing measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness.\nIf our stock price continues to remain below $1.00, our common stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market. On October 9, 2019, we received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), as the minimum bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of Kopin\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cKOPN.\u201d The Company has 180 calendar days, or until April 6, 2020, to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum bid price of Kopin\u2019s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum ten consecutive business days during this 180-day grace period. The Company\u2019s failure to regain compliance during this period could result in delisting. A special meeting of stockholders was held on March 2, 2020 where stockholders of record as of the record date of January 13, 2020 approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share, by a ratio of between one-for-two and one-for-twenty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment. We believe that such a reverse stock split, if effected, will cause our common stock to trade at a price above $1.00 per share. However, there can be no assurance that our stock price will increase to above $1.00 per share, whether as a result of a reverse stock split or otherwise, or that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s rule or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.\nWe have experienced a history of losses, have a significant accumulated deficit, have had negative cash flow from operating activities in 2019, 2018, and 2017, and expect to have negative cash flow from operating activities in 2020. Since inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. As of December 28, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $301.2 million. At December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we had $21.8 million and $37.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, respectively. For the years 2019 and 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $21.0 million and $28.1 million, respectively. The decline in our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily a result of funding our operating losses, of which a significant component is our investments in research and development. We plan to continue to invest in research and development even during periods when we are not profitable, which may result in our incurring losses from operations and negative cash flow. If we do not soon achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability, our financial condition will ultimately be materially and adversely affected, and we will be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to raise any necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOur history of net operating losses and our accumulated deficit raise doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors could lose their entire investment. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our becoming profitable in the future or to obtain the necessary capital to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due. Our determination of doubt as a going concern could materially limit our\nability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or otherwise. There can be no assurance that we will ever become profitable or continue as a going concern.\nOur revenues and cash flows could be negatively affected if sales of our Display products for military applications significantly decline. The sale of our display products to the military for use in thermal weapon sights and avionic helmets have been a primary source of our military revenues and cash flows over the last several years. We currently are designed in certain systems and are in qualification for other certain systems in the Family Weapon Sight (\"FWS\") program, which we believe is the next significant government procurement program that will use our technology. We may not be awarded contracts for the systems we are in qualification for, and for the systems we are qualified for we may only be awarded a portion of the program as the U.S. military looks to have multiple sources when possible. In addition, the government could postpone or cancel the programs. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military depends on our Display products being qualified and remaining qualified in the Strike Fighter, FWS and other U.S. military programs and on the U.S. military funding these programs. We believe the U.S. military is evaluating alternative display technologies for the Strike Fighter program. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military also depends on winning contracts over our competitors. If we are unable to be qualified into new U.S. military programs, remain qualified in existing programs, or win orders against our competition, or if military programs are not funded, then our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flow will be negatively impacted.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult. We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase orders and shipment schedules and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled before shipment without significant penalty. As a result, our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time, which makes forecasting our revenues difficult. In addition, due to the absence of substantial non-cancelable backlog, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels and the amounts we invest in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. If we fail to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results, our business may not be successful and the price of our common stock may decline. As a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nFluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\nThe timing of the initial selection of our Wearable technology and display products as components in our customers' new products;\n\u2022\nAvailability of interface electronics for our display products;\n\u2022\nCompetitive pressures on selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nThe timing and cancellation of customer orders;\n\u2022\nOur ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully reduce costs;\n\u2022\nThe cancellation of U.S. government contracts; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure agreements from our major customers for the purchase of our products.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nOur ability to manufacture and distribute our Display products would be severely limited if the foundries that we rely on to manufacture integrated circuits for our Display products fail to provide those services. We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our display products. In addition, our strategy is to use Chinese foundry services for OLED deposition and processing of OLED displays. We have no long-term contracts with foundries and from time to time we have been put on allocation, which means the foundry will limit the number of wafers they will process for us. If foundries were to terminate their arrangement with us or become unable to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our Display products or may be forced to manufacture them in\nlimited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms.\nOur reliance on these foundries involves certain risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nLack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nLimited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022\nThe risks associated with international commerce, including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability; and\n\u2022\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunami, mudslides, drought, hurricanes and tornadoes.\nDue to natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons that have occasionally occurred in Asia, many Taiwanese companies, including the Taiwanese foundry we use, have experienced related business interruptions. Our business could suffer significantly if any of the foundries we use had operations disrupted for an extended period of time due to natural disaster, political unrest or financial instability.\nWe may be unable to adequately control purchase pricing of certain critical materials, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have no long term pricing contracts on foundry wafers and certain other materials that represent a significant portion of product BoM costs. We cannot provide assurance against supplier price increases that negatively impact the cost of producing products, which may adversely affect sales or profitability. Finding and/or qualifying a more cost-effective replacement supplier may take significant time.\nOur investments in the development and sale of OLED microdisplays may not be successful which may materially adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flow. We historically have sold products that incorporate our proprietary AMLCDs. We believe that for certain applications OLED microdisplays have performance advantages and we believe some customers will want to switch from AMCLDs to OLED microdisplays in the next two to three years. We are in the process of designing and developing OLED microdisplays. Our plan is to outsource the production of the OLED microdisplays. We have little experience in production outsourcing. We expect to make significant monetary investments in the development of OLED microdisplays. If we are unsuccessful in designing and developing OLED microdisplays or if we are unable to find cost-effective third party production partners our sales and profitability may be negatively affected.\nWe depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and critical raw materials and we periodically receive \u201cend of life\u201d notices from suppliers that they will no longer be providing a raw material. We do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets that are used to electronically interface between our display products and our customers\u2019 products. Instead, we rely on third party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets. We purchase critical raw materials such as special glasses, special silicon on insulator (\"SOI\") wafers, light emitting diodes, adhesives, chemicals, lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components from third party suppliers. Some of these third party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, relative to the commercial market, the military buys a small number of units, which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. We periodically receive notices from suppliers of our critical raw materials regarding their plans to stop selling those raw materials. This requires us to identify another raw material and/or raw material supplier to replace the discontinued item/supplier, which would then require us to internally re-qualify the product with the new material as well as possibly re-qualify the product with our customer. If any of these third party contractors or suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply these integrated circuit chip sets or critical raw materials to us, whether for business or regulatory reasons, we would be unable to manufacture and sell our display products until a replacement material could be found. We may not be able to find a replacement material or if we are able to find a replacement material we may be unable to sell our products until they have been qualified both internally and with the customer. Lower volume purchases may make it uneconomical for some of our suppliers to provide the raw materials we need. We cannot assure investors that a replacement third party contractor or supplier could be found on reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our display products could cause our display business to be unsuccessful and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWidespread health problems, such as the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus, could materially adversely affect our business. The initial manufacturing steps for our AMLCD display products, our primary source of revenues, are performed in Taiwan and the product is then sent to the U.S. for completion. To complete the display in the USA we need to source raw materials and components from Asia. The initial manufacturing steps for our new OLED displays are performed in Asia and then sent to China for substantial completion. In addition, certain of our logistics and shipping operations are in Hong Kong. We also have other operations in Asia. We have many customers in Asia. Pandemics and epidemics such as the current coronavirus outbreak or other widespread public health problems could negatively affect our business. If, for example, the\ncoronavirus progresses in ways that disrupts the manufacture or shipment of our products or otherwise disrupt our operations, such disruption may materially negatively affect our operating results for 2020 and possible subsequent periods, including billings, revenue, gross margins, operating margins, cash flows and other operating results and our overall business. If the coronavirus spreads in ways that continue to negatively affect the overall economy and buying patterns of partners or potential customers, this would negatively affect, and may materially negatively affect, our sales, operating results or business. If the spread of the coronavirus limits the manufacturing of our products, by limiting components available this likely would result in lower revenue and would negatively affect, and may materially negatively affect, our operating results, cash flow and business.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The individual components that we offer for sale (displays, optical lenses, backlights and ASICs) are also offered by companies whose sole business focuses on that individual component. For example, there are companies whose sole business is to sell optical lenses. Accordingly, our strategy requires us to develop technologies and to compete in multiple markets. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, development and marketing resources than we do. The competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.\nOur success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements. If we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes, our business will suffer.\nDisruptions of our production could adversely affect our operating results. If we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities, we would be unable to supply our products to our customers. Many of our sales contracts include financial penalties for late delivery. In the past, we have experienced power outages at our facilities, which ranged in duration from one to four days. We have certain critical pieces of equipment necessary to operate our facilities that are no longer offered for sale and we may not have service contracts or spare parts for the equipment. Additionally, as we introduce new equipment into our manufacturing processes, our display products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency. We may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations.\nA disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations, revenue and profitability. Our data processing systems and our Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software are cloud-based and hosted by third parties. We also use software packages that are no longer supported by their developer. We have experienced short-term (i.e., a few days) interruptions in our Internet connectivity. An interruption of the third party systems or the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the third party systems for an extended period may affect our ability to operate our business and process transactions, which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf our information technology security systems were penetrated and confidential and or proprietary information were taken, we could be subject to fines, lawsuits and loss of customers. Significantly larger organizations with much greater resources than us have been the victim of cybercrimes. We routinely receive emails probing our Internet security, and our Internet security systems have detected outside organizations attempting to install Trojan virus software packages in our systems. We rely on our electronic information systems to perform the routine transactions to run our business. We transact business over the Internet with customers, vendors and our subsidiaries and have implemented security measures to protect unauthorized access to this information. We have also implemented security policies that limit access via the Internet from the Company to the outside world based on the individual\u2019s position in the Company. We routinely receive security patches from software providers for the software we use. Our primary concerns are inappropriate access to personnel information, information covered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, product designs and manufacturing information, financial information and our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of sale of our Solos product line and Whisper technology, which may adversely affect our business. On September 30, 2019 we entered into the Solos Purchase Agreement with Solos Technology, pursuant to which we sold and licensed certain assets of our Solos product line and Whisper technology. We will also receive a royalty in the single digits on the net sales amount of Solos products for a three-year period, after commencement of commercial production. As consideration for the transaction, we received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology\u2019s parent company, Solos Inc. Our 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has\nraised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing, after which we will have to participate in future equity offerings or have our ownership percentage decline. We may not be able to achieve the full strategic, financial or other benefits expected to result from the Solos Purchase Agreement, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. Specifically, (i) we may not derive any royalty revenue from the net sales amount of Solos products if little or no such sales occur, and (ii) the equity stake we have in Solos Inc. may decrease in value or lose its value completely. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our stock could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain existing software license relationships or other relationships relating to the intellectual property we use, our ability to grow revenue and achieve profitability and positive cash flow may be negatively affected. Our headset systems include software that we license from other companies. Should we violate the terms of a license, our license could be canceled. Companies may decide to stop supporting the software we license or new versions of the software may not be compatible with our software, which would require us to rewrite our software, which we may not be able to do. Moreover, the license fees we pay may be increased, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow.\nThe process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from currently pending or future patent applications or that our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued will be sufficient in scope and strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to or may initiate contested patent or patent application proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, foreign patent offices or the courts, which can demand significant financial and management resources. Patent applications in the U.S. typically are maintained in secrecy until they are published about 18 months after their earliest claim to priority. As publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive of inventions covered by our pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. We also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications or those of our licensors will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license, circumvent or cease manufacturing and sales of products covered by these patents, nor can we be sure that licenses, if needed, would be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may incur substantial costs in defending our intellectual property and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. Our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ or consulting for us. These measures may not adequately protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws afford only limited protection and our patents could be invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not provide full protection of our intellectual property rights. Misappropriation of our technology and the costs of defending our intellectual property rights from misappropriation could substantially impair our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may not be successful and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe cannot be certain that foreign intellectual property laws will allow protection of our intellectual property rights or that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around any patents issued or licensed to us. Our products might infringe upon the patent rights of others, whether existing now or in the future. For the same reasons, the products of others could infringe upon our patent rights. We may be notified, from time to time, that we could be or we are infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Litigation, which could be very costly and lead to substantial diversion of our resources, even if the outcome is favorable, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. These problems can be particularly severe in foreign countries. In the event of an adverse ruling in litigation against us for patent infringement, we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes, and cease the manufacture, use, importation and/or sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to patents of third parties covering the infringing technology. We cannot be certain that licenses will be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that damages for infringement will not be assessed or that litigation will not occur. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of any such claims could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as we presently conduct it and as we plan to conduct it in the future.\nWe also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. We believe that our future success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees in addition to patent ownership. Our employees enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ. Agreements with consultants generally provide that rights to inventions made by them while consulting for us will be assigned to us unless the assignment of rights is prohibited by the terms of any of their prior agreements. Agreements with employees, consultants and collaborators contain provisions intended to further protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. To date, we have had no experience in enforcing these agreements. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breaches. Our trade secrets may not be secure from discovery or independent development by competitors, in which case we may not be able to rely on these trade secrets to prevent our competitors from using them.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Companies in the display industry steadfastly pursue and protect their intellectual property rights. This has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity and enforceability of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against patent infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there are one or more successful claims of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, our business could be adversely affected. We are currently involved in an intellectual property dispute with Blue Radios, Inc., as described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. If the outcome of such dispute is adverse to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel. To continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business, we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business. Our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees. The loss of the services of one or more key employees, including Dr. John C.C. Fan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could seriously impede our success. We do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d insurance policies on Dr. Fan or any other employees. In addition, due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers, our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management, technical, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions. Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to develop and manufacture our products.\nOur customers who purchase display products for military applications typically incorporate our products into their products, which are sold to the U.S. government under contracts. U.S. government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business. Congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis, and Congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget. Many of our customers' contracts cover multiple years and, as such, are not fully funded at contract award. If Congress or a U.S. government agency chooses to spend money on other programs, our customers' contracts may be terminated for convenience. Federal laws, collectively called the Anti-Deficiency Act, prohibit involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law. Therefore, the Anti-Deficiency Act indirectly regulates how the agency awards our contracts and pays our invoices. Federal government contracts generally contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to, among other provisions: terminate our existing contracts; modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors; suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders; and claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nThe federal government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either \u201cfor convenience\u201d (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of\nsuch a contract may be limited. As is common with government contractors, we have experienced occasional performance issues under some of our contracts. We may in the future receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the federal government's satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, extensive specification and performance requirements, price negotiations and milestone requirements. Each U.S. government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies.\nMost of our military sales are on a fixed-price basis, which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns. Under a fixed-price contract, we receive only the amount indicated in the contract, regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates that we use to calculate the sales price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, we could incur losses. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, scheduling, and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then our cost to perform the work could increase, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Some of the contracts we bid on have \u201cIndefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity\u201d or IDIQ provisions. This means we are bidding a fixed price but are not assured of the quantity the government will buy or when it will buy during the term of the contract. This means we are exposed to the risk of price increases for labor, overhead and raw materials during the term of the contract. We may incur losses on fixed-price and IDIQ contracts that we had expected to be profitable, or such contracts may be less profitable than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing technologies, we may lose customers. Rapidly changing customer requirements, evolving technologies and industry standards characterize our industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences. We may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers, and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government customers. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may result in fines and penalties, including contractual damages. Among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are:\n\u2022\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulates the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts;\n\u2022\nThe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nThe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based federal government contracts; and\n\u2022\nLaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data. We engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of U.S. export control laws. Failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nOur contracting agency customers may review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts. If a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nTermination of contracts;\n\u2022\nForfeiture of profits;\n\u2022\nCost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses;\n\u2022\nSuspension of payments;\n\u2022\nFines; and\n\u2022\nSuspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.\nAdditionally, the False Claims Act provides for substantial civil penalties where, for example, a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. Civil actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts. If we are subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, our current business, future prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe U.S. government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, at any time. Any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy, be administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\nA decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (\"BCA\"), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years (\"FY\") 2012-2021 and has since been amended a number of times, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (\u201cBBA18\u201d). As a result, Department of Defense (\"DoD\") funding levels have fluctuated over this period and have been difficult to predict. Future spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes, depending on Congressional action. In addition, in recent years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a government shutdown and continuing resolutions to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. government agencies to continue operating. Most recently, the federal government was shut down due to lack of funding for over one month between late 2018 and early 2019. Additionally, the national debt has recently threatened to reach the statutory debt ceiling, and such an event in future years could result in the U.S. government defaulting on its debts.\nAs a result, defense spending levels are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future government priorities and the state of government finances. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nCustomer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We have incurred additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We purchase materials from foreign sources that may not cooperate and provide us with the necessary information to allow us to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. This may require us to find alternative sources, which could delay product shipments. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict-free.\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Korea, China and the United Kingdom. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) significantly changed the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations. Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.\nWe may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental laws and regulations and the ITAR, or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic or other hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. We are also subject to federal ITAR laws that regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use these products for military purposes. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not violated applicable laws or regulations in the past, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations.\nWe may be unable to modify our products to meet regulatory or customer requirements. From time to time our display products are subject to new domestic and international requirements, such as the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\") Directive. Our customers\u2019 terms and conditions require us to be in compliance with \u201call laws.\u201d If we are unable to comply with these regulations, we may not be permitted to ship our products, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to maintain profitability. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of laws we may be subject to fines and penalties.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions and investments, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the past we have made, and in the future we may make, acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, products and technologies that could complement or expand our business. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our existing business and products. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets. In 2017, 2012 and 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of NVIS, acquired 80% of the outstanding shares of eMDT Inc. and acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of FDD, respectively. If we are unable to operate eMDT, FDD and NVIS profitably, our results of operations will be negatively affected. We perform periodic reviews to determine if these investments are impaired, but such reviews are difficult and rely on significant judgment about the company\u2019s technology, ability to obtain customers, and ability to become cash flow positive and profitable. We may take future impairment charges which will have an adverse impact of on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we are a party to several joint ventures and investments where we may have some influence, but not complete control. Accordingly, we have limited control over their governance, financial reporting and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of our joint venture partners, having differing objectives from our partners, compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture or our partners and the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with the joint venture partner. As a result, these investments may not contribute to our earnings or cash flows. In addition, these joint ventures may be required to raise additional capital, which may result in our ownership percentage being decreased.\nChanges in China\u2019s laws, legal protections or government policies on foreign investment in China may harm our business. Our business and corporate transactions, including operations through our joint ventures, are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China as well as laws and regulations applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. These laws and regulations frequently change, and their interpretation and enforcement involves uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to us. Regulations and rules on foreign investments in China impose restrictions on the means that a foreign investor like us may apply to facilitate corporate transactions we may undertake. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. If any of our past operations are deemed to be non-compliant with Chinese law, we may be subject to penalties and our business and operations may be adversely affected. For instance, under the catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, some industries are categorized as sectors that are encouraged, restricted or prohibited for foreign investment. As the catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries is updated every few years, there can be no assurance that China\u2019s government will not change its policies in a manner that would render part or all of our business to fall within the restricted or prohibited categories. If we cannot obtain approval from relevant authorities to engage in businesses that has become prohibited or restricted for foreign investors, we may be forced to sell or restructure such business. Furthermore, China\u2019s government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying\nfines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. If we are forced to adjust our corporate structure or business as a result of changes in government policy on foreign investment or changes in the interpretation and application of existing or new laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed. Moreover, uncertainties in the Chinese legal system may impede our ability to enforce contracts with our business partners, customers and suppliers, or otherwise pursue claims in litigation to recover damages or loss of property, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment during that time is if the price of our common stock appreciates. We have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Historically, our earnings, if any, have been retained for the development of our businesses. Any recommendation by our Board to pay dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, and other factors. Accordingly, if the price of our common stock declines in the foreseeable future, you will incur a loss on your investment, without the likelihood that this loss will be offset in part or at all by potential future cash dividends.\nOur stock price may be volatile in the future. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the wireless communications, semiconductor and display markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors. In addition, the public stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and trading volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Credit rating downgrades in certain European countries and/or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the EU create uncertain global economic conditions. The UK\u2019s decision to voluntarily exit from the EU, generally referred to as the \u201cBrexit,\u201d may trigger short-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the Great Britain Pound in comparison to both the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Despite the UK having formally left the EU in January 2020, the future effects of Brexit remain uncertain and will depend on, among other things, the terms of any agreements the UK enters into governing UK access to EU and other markets either during the transitional period that is currently scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. The ongoing uncertainty could have a negative economic impact and result in further volatility in the markets for several years. The impact of the Brexit referendum and such ongoing uncertainty may result in various economic and financial consequences for businesses operating in the UK, the EU and beyond. We hold significant assets in the UK and operate a UK subsidiary, and the future impacts of the Brexit and the continued uncertainty surrounding the EU could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in government trade policies may increase the cost of our products, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability. We depend on a Taiwanese foundry for the manufacture of integrated circuits for our AMLCD display products and on Chinese and Korean foundries for our OLED display products. The U.S. and China have recently engaged in trade negotiations, the outcome of which remains uncertain. The U.S. has imposed, among other actions, new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from China in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices, and China has responded by proposing or implementing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the U.S. Tariffs on components that we import from China or other nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs have in some case and may in the future cause our expenses to increase, which would adversely affect our profitability unless we were able to exclude our products from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. In addition, future actions or escalations by either the U.S. or China that affect trade relations may also affect our business or that of our suppliers or customers, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take. Moreover, it is uncertain to what extent, if any, the U.S. tariffs on components that we import from China will affect the Taiwanese foundries on which we depend, in part because many Taiwanese foundries conduct parts of their manufacturing in China.\nA protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. To the extent that our sales or profitability are affected negatively by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 77515, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "KOPN"}
