{"cik": "886158", "company": "BED BATH & BEYOND INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\nGeneral economic factors beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, and changes in the economic climate have materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nGeneral economic factors that are beyond our control have materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These factors include, but are not limited to, recent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as housing markets, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of gasoline), interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters such as pandemics, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, conditions affecting the retail environment for products sold by us and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences. Changes in the economic climate and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on global supply chains, labor markets and economic activity, have materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause ongoing disruptions to our business. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, national and local governments in regions in which we operate have enacted various measures, including travel restrictions or bans, restrictions on events and gatherings, temporary closure of non-essential businesses, \"social distancing\" requirements, vaccine and mask mandates and various other requirements designed to slow the spread of COVID-19. While several of these measures have been eased, the extent, severity and overall duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its phases of resurgence and the introduction of new variants, some of which may be more transmissible or virulent, are unknown, and COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect, on our business and could also result in the recording of additional non-cash impairment charges. In future periods, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by reduced store traffic and consumer spending due to, among other things, significant continued unemployment and economic downturn, as well as consumer anxiety regarding shopping in physical stores.\nThe impacts and potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated protective measures that have had, continue to have or could directly or indirectly have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity also include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Store and distribution center closures in compliance with certain regulations, orders or advisories and increased costs related to the operation of our stores and distribution centers. In particular, in Fiscal 2020, we temporarily closed all retail store locations (other than BABY and Harmon Face Values), which have since been reopened;\n\u2022Potential inability of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, commercial banks and other external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, or by travel restrictions and border closures;\n\u2022Negative impact on our employees. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including, at times, employee travel and work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and temporary furloughs), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees;\n\u2022Potential impact on our ability to meet our obligations to business partners, including under our secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\"), which contains a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, and under our current lease obligations. We have renegotiated and may continue to renegotiate payment terms for goods, services and rent. Similar to other retailers, in Fiscal 2020, we had also withheld portions of and/or delayed payments to certain of our business partners as we negotiate revisions to our payment terms, in order to further maintain liquidity given the temporary store closures. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to successfully renegotiate payment terms with all such business partners, and the ultimate outcome of these activities, including the responses of all business partners, is not yet known;\n\u2022Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for our products, which have been and may continue to be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability or reluctance of consumers to shop at our stores or buy our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, unemployment or other financial hardship, and change in consumer preferences and shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products;\n\u2022Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock and availability and cost of credit, which could negatively affect our liquidity;\n\u2022Delays, interruptions and disruptions in our supply chain and higher shipping charges have impacted, and could continue to impact our ability to maintain supplies of products and the costs associated with obtaining products;\n\u2022Labor shortages, wage pressures and competition for talent;\n\u2022The extent of dissemination and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness against COVID-19 and its evolving strains, some of which may be more transmissible or virulent than the initial strain;\n\u2022Additional widespread resurgences in COVID-19 infections; and\n\u2022Evolving safety protocols such as mask mandates and requirements for proof of vaccination or regular testing in certain of our markets, including as may be set forth by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and the extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economy and us will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, and, in part, on the nature and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by governments. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position, and results of operations will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains, the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-19 testing, and government actions, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity; however, the fluidity and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition, and financial performance, which could be material.\nFor more information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business, see \"Item 1 - Business - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nWe operate in the highly competitive retail business where the use of emerging technologies as well as unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of competitors may adversely affect our performance.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, technology, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. These competitors range from specialty retailers to department stores and discounters as well as online and multichannel retailers, some of which are larger than us with significantly greater financial resources. In recent years, competition has further intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity and deep price discounting.\nRapidly evolving technologies are also altering the manner in which we and our competitors communicate and transact with customers. Our execution of the elements of our transformation strategy is designed to adapt to these changes, in the context of competitors\u2019 actions, customers' adoption of new technology and related changes in customer behavior, and presents a specific risk in the event that we are unable to successfully execute our plans or adjust them over time as needed. Further, unanticipated changes in pricing and other practices of our competitors, including promotional activity (particularly during back-to-school/college and/or holiday periods), reduced thresholds for free shipping and rapid price fluctuation enabled by technology, may adversely affect our performance. If we are unable to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape and maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our merchandise, reduced sales and margins, inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and loss of market share. For more information on our strategy, see \"Item 1 - Business - Strategy.\"\nOur failure to anticipate and respond in a timely fashion to changes in consumer preferences and demographic factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics in order to maintain and attract customers. We must continue to monitor and react to consumer expectations, such as the increased focus on environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters, climate change, and sustainable products, and appropriately manage our brand to promote the right product lines (including our Owned Brands), drive customer loyalty and protect our reputation. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, shopping and spending patterns and other life interest decisions, including as a result of COVID-19, could lead to, among other things, excess inventories, a shortage of products or reputational damage, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must manage our inventory effectively and commensurately with customer demand. Often, we need to order merchandise, and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacturing of such merchandise, multiple seasons in advance of and frequently before customer trends and preferences are known. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends and preferences. These extended lead times may also increase our exposure to the effects of global supply chain disruptions, increasing the risk that merchandise is not received when originally planned. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases. If we do not accurately predict our customers\u2019 preferences and demands for our products, our inventory levels will not be appropriate, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and revenues historically realized during the back to school/college and holiday seasons. We must carry a significant amount of inventory during this time, and if we are not able to sell the inventory, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. Similarly, if we do not adequately stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back to school and holiday seasons, and fail to meet customer demand, revenue and customer loyalty may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our financial results during the holiday season may fluctuate significantly based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire Fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nSTRATEGY RISKS\nWe may face challenges in executing our omni-channel and transformation strategy.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, we began executing on elements of our transformation strategy. Our ability to implement our strategic direction is based on a number of key assumptions regarding the future economic environment and our ability to meet certain ambitions, goals and targets, among other things. If any of these assumptions (including but not limited to our ability to meet certain ambitions, goals and targets) prove inaccurate in whole or in part, our ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of this strategy could be limited, including our ability to meet our stated financial objectives and retain key employees. Factors beyond our control, including but not limited to market and economic conditions, execution risk related to the implementation of our strategy and other challenges and risk factors discussed in this annual report, could limit our ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of this strategy. If we are unable to implement this strategy successfully in whole or in part or should the components of the strategy that are implemented fail to produce the expected benefits, our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, an important part of our strategy involves providing customers with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are increasingly using technology to compare and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our omni-channel strategy, and our ability to compete and meet customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omni-channel experiences. In addition, execution of our omni-channel strategy and the expansion of our e-commerce business will require significant investments in technology. If we are unable to successfully implement our omni-channel strategy, our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy also involves the introduction of certain new Owned Brand merchandise, and the associated removal from our existing product assortment of existing third-party merchandise. These Owned Brands and the associated changes to our product assortment may not be successful in terms of customer acceptance, and/or may not achieve the revenue or margin improvements we anticipate. In addition, maintaining a larger assortment of Owned Brand products exposes us to additional reputational and regulatory risks, including those related to compliance with product safety and marketing requirements.\nFor more information on our strategy, see \"Item 1 - Business - Strategy.\"\nSuccessful execution of our omni-channel and transformation strategy is dependent, in part, on our ability to establish and profitably maintain the appropriate mix of digital and physical presence in the markets we serve.\nSuccessful execution of our omni-channel strategy depends, in part, on our ability to develop our digital capabilities in conjunction with optimizing our physical store operations and market coverage, while maintaining profitability. Our ability to develop these capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our assessment and implementation of emerging technologies and our ability to manage a changing mix of in-store and online orders (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as our ability to drive store traffic. The success of our omni-channel strategy is also dependent on our ability to effectively manage inventory across our physical stores and online channels. Our ability to optimize our store operations and market coverage requires active management of our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, which to the extent it involves the relocation of existing stores, store remodels or the opening of additional stores will depend on a number of factors, including our identification and availability of suitable locations; our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; and our timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays based on weather or other events. These factors could potentially increase the cost of doing business and the risk that our business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect our performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.\nThere are risks associated with our store fleet optimization strategies, pursuant to which we have closed 207 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores as of the end of Fiscal 2021.\nAs part of our ongoing business transformation, we have been executing a store fleet optimization program that included the closure of approximately 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores by the end of Fiscal 2021. In connection with this program, we incurred approximately $92.4 million in costs including contract termination costs, employee-related costs, professional fees and non-cash impairment charges, of which approximately $47.9 million was incurred in Fiscal 2021. The store fleet optimization program involves numerous risks, including, without limitation, the diversion of our attention from our businesses and operations. These or other factors may impair our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the program, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of February 26, 2022, 207 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores have been closed. We may also determine that additional store closures are warranted in the future.\nAcquisitions, partnerships or investments, divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.\nAs part of our business transformation and omni-channel strategy, we may make significant investments in technology, acquire businesses aligned with our strategy and growth objectives or enter into strategic partnerships. If we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, establish and manage investments and partnerships or if such activities do not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return, our financial condition or results of operation may be adversely affected.\nWe continually assess shareholder value and strategic fit of our existing businesses, and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired shareholder value or return on investment. Such transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including, but not limited to, not being able to achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits or obtain satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all. Even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share or adversely impact corporate overhead contribution/allocation associated with divested brands, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management or result in disputes with buyers. We may also be required to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities related to any businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies may have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition, uncertainty about the effect of any potential divestiture on employees, business partners, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause business partners, suppliers, vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of any potential divestiture, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to divest any such businesses, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms and will continue to be subject to the risks of operating such businesses. For more information on our strategy and recent divestitures, see \"Item 1 - Business.\"\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nA major disruption of, or failure to successfully implement or make changes to, our information technology systems could negatively impact results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by a major disruption of our information technology systems. We rely heavily on these systems to process transactions with customers and vendors, manage inventory replenishment, summarize results and control distribution of products. Despite numerous safeguards and careful contingency planning, these systems are still subject to power outages, telecommunication failures, cybercrimes, cybersecurity attacks and other catastrophic events. A major disruption of the systems and their backup mechanisms may cause us to incur significant costs to repair the systems, experience a critical loss of data and/or result in significant business interruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we regularly evaluate and make changes and upgrades to our information systems. As part of our transformation strategy, we have commenced a multi-year effort to evaluate and, where appropriate, upgrade and/or replace certain of our information systems, including systems for inventory management, order management and our finance systems. These system changes and upgrades can require significant capital investments, dedication of resources and time to fully implement. During this transition, we may need to continue to operate on legacy infrastructure, which has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. While we follow a disciplined methodology when evaluating and making such changes, there can be no assurances that we will successfully implement such changes, that such changes will occur without disruptions to our operations or that the new or upgraded systems will achieve the desired business objectives.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure (including third-party service providers) could interfere with our operations. These disruptions can lead to unplanned remediation costs to address enhancements to our IT systems and result in loss of consumer confidence and other negative consequences, which may include litigation and regulatory penalties.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store relevant information about our customers and employees in the ordinary course of business in connection with certain activities, including, without limitation credit card processing, website hosting, data encryption and software support. As a result, we face risks associated with unauthorized access to our or our third-party service providers\u2019\ninformation technology systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. We make significant resource investments to protect this information and continue to invest in resources to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data. As we migrate our legacy systems to cloud-based technologies hosted by third-parties, we also continue to develop systems and processes that are designed to protect our customer, associate, and company information. However, it is not always possible to anticipate the evolving threat landscape and mitigate all risks to our systems and information, and while these measures provide reasonable security, our efforts have not in the past, and may not in the future, prevent all incidents of data breach or theft. We could also be affected by risks to the systems and information of our vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties. Risks relating to cyberattacks on our vendors and other third parties have also been increasing due to more frequent and severe supply chain attacks impacting software and information technology service providers in recent years.\nFor example, in October 2019, we discovered that a third party acquired e-mail and password information from a source outside of our systems that was used to access our online customer accounts. On October 29, 2019, we sent notifications to certain customers as required by applicable legal requirements. None of our online customers\u2019 payment cards were compromised as a result of this incident.\nGlobally, the sophistication, frequency and severity of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, sabotage systems or degrade system performance continue to evolve and become harder to detect. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our third-party service providers, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or, implement security measures in a timely manner or ensure that any such security measures will be effective. If we experience a material cybersecurity incident impacting the confidentiality and integrity of our data or operations of systems this could interfere with our operations and cause us to incur unplanned significant remediation costs to address enhancements to our IT resources, affect our ability to carry out our businesses, impair the trust of our customers or potential customers and expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties and damage relating to loss of proprietary information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and our brand and reputation.\nDamage to our reputation in any aspect of our operations could potentially impact our operating and financial results.\nOur reputation is based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities, so incidents involving our brand, our Owned Brands, our products or the retail industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nAs we increase the number of items available to be shipped directly from a vendor to a customer for home delivery or in-home assembly, we increasingly rely on the performance of these third-party merchandise vendors and service providers. Our focus on executing strategic partnerships also means that we will rely on the performance of those partners for activities that directly impact the customer experience. Any deficiencies in performance by these third parties or partners could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, despite our monitoring controls and procedures.\nFederal, state and local governments, our customers and consumers and shareholders are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental and other sustainability issues. In response, we have committed to an ambitious ESG strategy. In order to reach these ambitions and goals, we will need to incorporate ESG considerations into our business strategy, products and services, and may incur significant cost and effort in doing so. Failure to manage and successfully execute our ESG strategy or address ESG matters appropriately (or being able to do so only at a significant expense to our business), or failure to adapt our strategy and business to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations, may result in reputational damage and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.\nIn addition, challenges to our compliance with various regulations, rules and laws, including but not limited to, those related to social, product, labor and environmental matters could also jeopardize our reputation and lead to adverse publicity, especially in the rapidly changing media environment. The increased use of digital platforms, such as social media, by us and consumers has also increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted by information about or affecting us that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated.\nDamage to our brand and reputation could potentially impact our operating and financial results, diminish customer trust and generate negative customer sentiment, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on managing costs of labor, merchandise and other expenses that are subject to factors beyond our control.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, labor organizing activities and changing demographics. Our ability to find qualified merchandise vendors and service providers and obtain access to products in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner can be adversely affected by trade restrictions, political instability, financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs, disruptions to our supply chain network serving our stores, distribution facilities and customers due to labor disturbances and other items, and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of our supply chain capabilities due to trade restrictions, port-related issues such as closures, congestion or delays, political instability, war (including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine), changes in tax or trade policy, weather, natural disaster, pandemics (including COVID-19), terrorism, product recalls, labor supply or stoppages, financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products and adversely impact the costs we incur to distribute our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, it could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nHistorically, we have purchased substantially all of our merchandise in the United States, with the majority from domestic sources (who may manufacture overseas) and the balance from importers. As we continue to expand our assortment of proprietary Owned Brand merchandise, the portion of our merchandise that we purchase directly from overseas sources is increasing, and represented approximately 22% of our total purchases in Fiscal 2021.\nWe have experienced in 2021, and expect to continue to experience in 2022, supply chain disruptions, including increased product costs, increased shipping and transportation costs, increased labor wages, labor shortages and port and other delivery delays and associated charges. In addition to increased costs, disruptions may also result in inventory management issues, such as slow replenishment, out-of-stocks and excessive inventory levels. In an effort to mitigate these risks, and as part of our business transformation and strategy, we plan to make capital investments in initiatives aimed to help modernize our supply chain and network operations. As part of this program, we have partnered with Ryder System, Inc. to develop and operate two new regional distribution centers to provide merchandise to regional stores for both in-store shopping and online shopping services such as BOPIS or Curbside, Same Day Delivery, and Ship from Store. The first of these facilities began operations in the second half of Fiscal 2021. Failure to effectively manage this and other supply chain modernization initiatives could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, any significant changes to trade policy, including implementation of additional tax or import restrictions, could result in additional costs to us or require us to seek alternative sources of supply, which could negatively impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs of materials, labor and other costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In the current inflationary environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The impact of COVID-19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets, as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve.\nInefficient management of relationships and dependencies on third-party service providers could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely on third parties to support our business and provide certain services, which include portions of our technology and operational infrastructure. As a result, our business model is complex and can be challenging to manage. If we do not properly\nmanage these relationships, or if these third-party service providers fail to perform, meet expectations, or face disruptions, it could result in the loss of our competitive position and reputational damage and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on the ability of our employees in all areas of the organization to execute our business plan and, ultimately, to satisfy our customers.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of the organization may be affected by a number of factors, including geographic relocation of employees, operations or facilities and the highly competitive markets in which we operate, including the markets for the types of skilled individuals needed to support our continued success. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn particular, our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees terminate their employment, become ill (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team's attention may be diverted. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExtreme or unusual weather patterns caused by climate change or otherwise, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, as well as regulatory or market measures and changing consumer preferences in response to climate change and ESG matters, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with extreme weather patterns, including the impacts of climate change. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, such as heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados, earthquakes, wild fires, or a combination of these and other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example, extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period of time in the areas in which our stores or distribution centers are located, especially in areas with a high concentration of our stores, may make it difficult for our customers or associates to travel to our stores or distribution centers and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. These conditions can have similar impacts to our supply chain operations causing delivery disruptions or delays in order fulfillment. Such extreme weather conditions or natural disasters could cause significant damage to, destroy and/or force the closure of our stores and distribution centers, as well as those of our third-party service providers.\nIn addition, our business is susceptible to unusual and unseasonable weather patterns, such as extended periods of warm temperatures in the fall and winter seasons or cool temperatures in the spring and summer seasons, which could result in inappropriate inventory levels, especially for our BABY business, and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is also increased focus, including by investors, customers and other stakeholders, on climate change and other ESG and sustainability matters, including single use plastic, energy, waste and worker safety. Concern about climate and sustainability-related issues may result in changes in consumer preference, including moving away from products considered to have high climate change impact and toward products that are more sustainably made. If we fail to adapt to these changing consumer preferences, our business, results of operations and reputation may be materially adversely affected.\nConcern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation and utility cost increases that adversely affect our business. New or more stringent climate change-related mandates, laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing mandates, law or regulations, could also require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCAPITAL RISKS\nDisruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access our cash and cash equivalents.\nWe may have amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. While we closely manage our cash and cash equivalents balances to minimize risk, if there were disruptions in the financial markets\n(including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits, and it may negatively impact the availability and cost of capital.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be subject to volatility, and this and other factors may affect elements of our capital allocation strategy such as share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction.\nOur stock price has experienced volatility over time and this volatility may continue, in part due to factors such as those mentioned in this Item 1A. Stock volatility in itself may adversely affect shareholder confidence as well as employee morale and retention for those associates who receive equity grants as part of their compensation packages. The impact on employee morale and retention could adversely affect our business performance and financial results. Stock volatility and other factors may also affect elements of our capital allocation strategy, and our ability to use equity to fund acquisitions or raise capital.\nIn addition, we have received, and may continue to receive, significant media attention, including from blogs, articles, message boards and social media. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate, or contain misleading, incomplete or otherwise damaging information, which could influence trading activity in our stock. As a result, our stock has experienced, and could continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance, financial position or other business fundamentals. This activity along with other factors, including the involvement of short sellers or activist investors in our stock, has materially impacted in the past, and could materially impact in the future, the trading price of our stock, put pressure on the supply and demand for our stock, limit our stockholders from readily selling their shares and result in significant loss of investment.\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, since December 2004, our Board of Directors has authorized several share repurchase programs, and in April 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend program. Decisions regarding share repurchases and dividends are within the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will be influenced by a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, general business and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, the emergence of alternative investment or acquisition opportunities, changes in business strategy and other factors. Changes in, or the elimination of, our share repurchase programs or dividend could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our share repurchase program could change, and would be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock price. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we postponed our plans for share repurchases and suspended the payment of dividends and planned debt reductions. We recommenced share repurchase programs on October 28, 2020 and in Fiscal 2020 entered into accelerated share repurchase programs on October 28, 2020 and January 7, 2021 (as amended on January 29, 2021), totaling $375.0 million. In Fiscal 2021, we announced that we intended to complete our $1 billion three year repurchase plan by the end of Fiscal 2021, two years ahead of schedule, and completed share repurchases of $574.9 million, bringing cumulative repurchases under this plan to approximately $950.0 million through February 26, 2022. An additional approximately $40.0 million was repurchased in March of 2022. For more information on our dividends and share repurchase programs, see \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nOur business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred indebtedness under senior unsecured notes and have entered into the ABL Facility. Our ability to pay interest and principal when due, comply with debt covenants or repurchase the senior unsecured notes if a change of control occurs, will depend upon, among other things, sales and cash flow levels and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance, including prevailing economic conditions and financial and business factors, many of which are beyond our control. Given the current economic environment, and potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, we may be unable to maintain compliance with the springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL Facility in future periods, to the extent the covenant is applicable under the terms of the ABL Facility, which would among other things, result in an event of default under the ABL Facility.\nIf we become unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service requirements, we may be forced to take remedial actions such as restructuring or refinancing our debt; seeking additional debt or equity capital; reducing or delaying our business activities, or selling assets. There can be no assurance that any such measures would be successful.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nChanges in statutory, regulatory, and other legal requirements at a local, state or provincial and national level, or deemed noncompliance with such requirements, could potentially impact our operating and financial results.\nWe are subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state or provincial and national level, and this regulatory environment is subject to constant change. Our operating results could be negatively impacted by developments in\nthese areas due to the costs of compliance in addition to possible government penalties and litigation, operating interruptions and reputational damage in the event of deemed noncompliance. Changes in the law or the regulatory environment, or deemed noncompliance with such laws or regulations, in the areas of customer, employee or product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, labor, wage and hour laws, and international trade policy, among others, could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nAs part of our business transformation and strategy, we have expanded our product offerings to include a selection of Owned Brands. This expansion brings additional regulatory and compliance requirements, which require new resources and the development of new policies and procedures. Our failure to properly manage our expanded business or comply with these regulations could expose us to fines, penalties, litigation and other costs that could harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nChanges to accounting rules, regulations and tax laws, or new interpretations of existing accounting standards or tax laws could negatively impact our operating results and financial position.\nOur operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by changes to accounting rules and regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. Our effective income tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting standards as well as changes in tax laws or the interpretations of these tax laws by courts and taxing authorities, which could negatively impact our financial results. Such changes would include for example, the possible adoption by the United States of additional tariffs, or the disallowance of tax deductions, with respect to imported merchandise.\nNew, or developments in existing, litigation, claims or assessments could potentially impact our reputation, operating and financial results.\nWe are involved in litigation, claims and assessments incidental to our business, the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on our reputation, financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by changes in our assumptions related to these matters. While outcomes of such actions vary, any such claim or assessment against us could negatively impact our reputation, operations and financial results.\nA failure of our business partners to adhere to appropriate laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact our reputation.\nWe engage with various third parties to meet business needs. These business partners include, among others, vendors, suppliers, and service providers. The failure of these business partners to comply with applicable regulations, rules, laws, and industry standards could negatively impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77659, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "BBBY"}
