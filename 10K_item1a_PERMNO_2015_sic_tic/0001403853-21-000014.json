{"cik": "1403853", "company": "Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section describes material risks to our businesses that currently are known to us. You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and factors listed below, however, are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other known risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We also are subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur business depends on spending by our customers in the oil and natural gas industry in the United States, and this spending and our business have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control. Continued and prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices and in the overall level of exploration and development may adversely affect demand and pricing for our services.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. These expenditures are generally dependent on current oil and natural gas prices and the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices, including the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. A continued and prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect us by negatively impacting utilization, demand for our services and pricing.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control. A substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in significant reductions in our customers\u2019 operating and capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any extended decline could result in diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices customers are willing to pay for services such as ours. There is no guarantee that oil and natural gas prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will remain stable or increase, or we will see an increase in the demand for our services.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been negatively impacted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic along with an international oil supply conflict, resulting in a significant decline in oil prices, and we expect this situation may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, reported results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak emanating from China in December 2019 has impacted various businesses throughout the world. The outbreak was labeled as a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Governments enacted significant actions to mitigate the public health crisis, including enacting travel restrictions, the extended shutdown of certain non-essential businesses and shelter in place/stay at home orders in many of the impacted geographic regions. Additionally, beginning in early March 2020, the global oil markets were negatively impacted by an oil supply conflict occurring when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) was initially unable to reach an agreement on production levels for crude oil, at which point Saudi Arabia and Russia initiated efforts to aggressively increase production. The convergence of these events created the unprecedented dual impact of a dramatic decline in the demand for oil coupled with the risk of substantial excess supply. The resulting negative impact to oil prices was significant with the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil plummeting 56% during March 2020. The pandemic precipitated a significant slowdown in the global economy, thereby contributing to a material reduction in consumer demand for oil, dramatically lower oil prices, and as a result, drastically lower customer demand for our services. WTI crude oil prices have risen since May 2020 and ended the year at $48.52. In addition, in January 2021, Saudi Arabia agreed to cut oil production, causing WTI crude oil prices to reach levels not seen since February 2020. Despite the improvement in the crude oil markets, drilling and completion activity remains depressed relative to the levels experienced prior to the onset of the pandemic. Our operations and financial results to date have been negatively impacted by this situation, and this situation has had a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, reported results and financial condition for 2020, which may continue into 2021 and beyond.\nThe adverse impacts we have and may continue to experience include, but are not limited to, disruptions to customer demand for our services; to commodities markets generally; to the availability of fuel, equipment and other materials; to our workforce; to customers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding invoices or to remain solvent; or to our business relationships with subcontractors and other third-parties. Other possible risks to our business include potential limitations on oil and gas production from regulations imposed by states and other jurisdictions, a change in demand for oil and natural gas resulting from fundamental changes in how people work, travel and socialize, or litigation risk and possible loss contingencies from the impact of COVID-19, including commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements. Any such disruptions could increase our costs or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business operations, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our liquidity will be negatively impacted if oil and natural gas prices do not return to levels that induce our customers to increase their expenditures on activities that drive demand for our services. We may have to draw on amounts available under our operating line of credit and otherwise seek additional forms of financing to meet our financial obligations. Obtaining such financing is not guaranteed, and is largely dependent upon market conditions and other factors. The current environment may make it even more difficult to comply with our covenants and other restrictions in our credit facilities, and a lack of confidence in our industry on the part of the financial markets may result in a lack of access to capital, any of which could lead to reduced liquidity, an event of default, inability to draw on amounts available under our operating line of credit, the possible acceleration of our outstanding debt, the exercise of certain remedies by our lender, or a limited ability or inability to refinance our debt.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic situation is dynamic, and updates on restrictions on travel and non-essential businesses and shelter in place/stay at home orders are continually evolving. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain as the ultimate severity and duration of the outbreak is unknown. However, this situation has had a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, reported results and financial condition for fiscal 2020, and we expect it to continue during fiscal 2021.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our growth initiatives, including through future acquisitions and divestitures, and we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we do acquire and identify and manage risks inherent in such acquisitions.\nOur business strategy may include growth through the acquisitions of other businesses and divestitures of non-core businesses or assets. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention. Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the investment of our capital resources without realizing the expected returns on such investment. We also may not recognize the anticipated benefits of completed dispositions or other divestitures we may pursue in the future. We may evaluate potential divestiture opportunities with respect to portions of our business from time to time that support our growth initiatives, and may determine to proceed with a divestiture opportunity if and when we believe such opportunity is consistent with our business strategy and we would be able to realize value to our stockholders in so doing. If we do not realize the expected strategic, economic or other benefits of any divestiture transaction, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur operating margins and profitability may be negatively impacted by changes in fuel and energy costs. In addition, due to certain fixed costs, our operating margins and earnings may be sensitive to changes in revenues.\nOur business is dependent on availability of fuel for operating our fleet of trucks. Changes and volatility in the price of crude oil can adversely impact the prices for fuel and therefore affect our operating results. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC+ and other oil and natural gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns. Furthermore, our facilities, fleet and personnel subject us to fixed costs, which make our margins and earnings sensitive to changes in revenues. In periods of declining demand, we may be unable to cut costs at a rate sufficient to offset revenue declines, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage to firms with lower or more flexible cost structures, and may result in reduced operating margins and/or higher operating losses. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture charges due to possible impairments of assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Impairment of Goodwill\u201d included in Item 7 herein, during the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $29.5 million leaving no remaining goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we recorded total impairment charges of $15.6 million, $0.8 million and $4.8 million for long-lived assets and long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively, which were included in \u201cImpairment of long-lived assets\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations. If there is further deterioration in our business operations or prospects, our stock price, the broader economy or our industry, including further declines in oil and natural gas prices, the value of our long-lived assets, or those we may acquire in the future, could decrease significantly and result in additional impairment and financial statement write-offs.\nThe testing of long-lived assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the composition of our reporting units; changes in economic, industry or market conditions; changes in business operations; changes in competition; or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or differences in our actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, could affect the fair value of long-lived assets, which may result in further impairment charges. We perform the assessment of potential impairment at least annually, or more often if events and circumstances require. Should the value of our long-lived assets become impaired, we would incur additional charges which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in us incurring additional net operating losses in future periods.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to conduct our business, and our failure or inability to make sufficient capital investments could significantly harm our business prospects.\nThe development of our business and services, excluding acquisition activities, requires capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made gross cash capital expenditures of approximately $3.4 million, including expenditures to extend the useful life and productivity on our fleet of trucks, tanks, equipment and disposal wells. We continue to focus on finding ways to improve the utilization of our existing assets and optimize the allocation of resources in the various shale areas in which we operate. In addition to capital expenditures required to maintain our current level of business activity, we may incur capital expenditures to support future growth of our business. Our capital expenditure program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. In addition, our credit facilities currently limit the amount of our capital expenditures to $7.5 million annually.\nWe expect our gross capital spending levels in 2021 to remain generally consistent with 2020. Prolonged reductions or delays in capital expenditures could delay or diminish future cash flows and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our planned capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, finance leases, borrowings under our operating line of credit, or a combination of the foregoing. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of drilling activity and oil and natural gas production of our customers, prices of natural gas and oil, and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our ability to obtain capital from other sources, such as the capital markets, is dependent upon many of those same factors as well as the orderly functioning of credit and capital markets. To the extent we fail to have adequate funds, we could be required to further reduce or defer our capital spending, or pursue other funding alternatives which may not be as economically attractive to us, which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation and/or modify the benefits provided to our employees in future periods.\nMaintaining a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our operations. We and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers. The high turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, increase driver compensation and/or modify our benefit packages, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Additionally, in anticipation of or in response to geographical and market-related fluctuations in the demand for our services, we strategically relocate our equipment and personnel from one area to another, which may result in operating inefficiencies, increased labor, fuel and other operating costs and could adversely affect our growth and profitability. As a result, our driver and employee training and orientation costs could be negatively impacted. We also utilize the services of independent contractor truck drivers to supplement our trucking capacity in certain shale areas on an as-needed basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these types of arrangements on favorable terms, or that there will be sufficient qualified independent contractors available to meet our needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Our three largest customers represented 34% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and in total equaled 27% of our consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2020. The loss of all, or even a portion, of the revenues from these customers, as a result of competition, market conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. A reduction in exploration, development and production activities by key customers due to the current declines in oil and natural gas prices, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCustomer payment delays of outstanding receivables and customer bankruptcies could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nWe typically provide credit to our customers for our services, and we are therefore subject to the risk of our customers delaying or failing to pay outstanding invoices. Although we monitor individual customer financial viability in granting such credit arrangements and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts, in weak economic environments, customers\u2019 delays and failures to pay often increase due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to credit markets. If our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of outstanding receivables, it could reduce our availability under our operating line of credit or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the past or are currently under bankruptcy proceedings, and certain of our customers\u2019 businesses face financial challenges that put them at risk of future bankruptcies. Customer bankruptcies could delay or in some cases eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable that are outstanding at the time the customer enters bankruptcy proceedings. We are also at risk that we may be required to refund amounts collected from a customer during the period immediately prior to that customer\u2019s bankruptcy filing, and the amount we ultimately collect from the customer\u2019s bankruptcy estate may be significantly less. Customer bankruptcies may also reduce our availability under our operating line of credit. Although we maintain reserves for potential customer credit losses, customer bankruptcies could result in unanticipated credit losses. As a result, if one or more of our customers enter bankruptcy proceedings, particularly our larger customers or those to whom we have greater credit exposure, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to achieve or maintain pricing to our customers at a level sufficient to cover our costs, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nWe may be unable to charge prices to our customers that are sufficient to cover our costs. Our pricing is subject to highly competitive market conditions, and we may be unable to increase or maintain pricing as market conditions change. Likewise, customers may seek pricing declines more precipitously than our ability to reduce costs. In certain cases, we have entered into fixed price agreements with our customers, which may further limit our ability to raise the prices we charge our customers at a rate sufficient to offset any increases in our costs. Additionally, some customers\u2019 obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events, some of which are beyond our control, including force majeure events. Force majeure events may include (but are not limited to) events such as revolutions, wars, acts of enemies, embargoes, import or export restrictions, strikes, lockouts, fires, storms, floods, acts of God, explosions, mechanical or physical failures of our equipment or facilities of our customers. If the amounts we are able to charge customers are insufficient to cover our costs, or if any customer suspends, terminates or curtails its business relationship with us, the effects could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe litigation environment in which we operate poses a significant risk to our businesses.\nWe are occasionally involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, and environmental issues, other claims for injuries and damages, and various shareholder and class action litigation, among other matters. We may experience negative outcomes in such lawsuits in the future. Any such negative outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from such assessments and estimates. The settlement or resolution of such claims or proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, judges and juries in certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage and other tort cases. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but the litigation environment in these areas poses a significant business risk to us and could cause a significant diversion of management\u2019s time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe hazards and risks associated with the transport, storage, handling and disposal of our customers\u2019 waste (such as fires, spills, explosions and accidents) may expose us to personal injury claims, property damage claims and/or products liability claims from our employees, customers or third parties. As protection against such claims and operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. However, we may sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. As more fully described in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein, due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits, and we may be held liable for significant personal injury or damage to property or third parties, or other losses, that are not fully covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and there can be no certainty that we will maintain our current customers, attract new customers or that our operating margins will not be impacted by competition.\nThe industries in which our business operates are highly competitive. We compete with numerous local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources. Competition intensified during the most recent downturn, and could further intensify in the future. Furthermore, numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on providing similar services to those that we provide that will compete with our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures, including possible downward pressure on the prices we charge for our products and services, will not arise. In addition, any declines in oil and natural gas prices may result in competitors moving resources from higher-cost exploration and production areas to relatively lower-cost exploration and production areas where we are located thereby increasing supply and putting further downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our products and services, including our rental business. In the event that we cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis, or competitive pressures arise, such inability to compete or competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers\u2019 business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing, refining, and export systems and disruptions impacting those systems could adversely impact our business.\nThe price our customers receive for crude oil and natural gas is significantly impacted by the cost, availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, pipeline and rail systems and centralized storage, processing, refining and export facilities. The inadequacy or unavailability of capacity in these systems and facilities could result in the deferral or cancellation of drilling and completion activities, the shut-in of producing wells, the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties or higher operational costs for our customers. If our customers\u2019 business operations are negatively impacted for these or other reasons, it likely would reduce customer demand for our services and negatively impact our business.\nCertain shale basins, including the Bakken shale area in which our Rocky Mountain operating division is located, are particularly susceptible to increases in the cost of product transport and disruptions in transport capacity due to the long distance between the geographic area where production occurs and the locations of centralized storage, processing, refining and export facilities in other parts of the United States. Although additional pipeline infrastructure has generally increased takeaway capacity in the Bakken shale area in recent years, ongoing legal disputes regarding pipeline systems, including the current litigation regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline (\u201cDAPL\u201d) which became commercially operational in 2017, have resulted in periodic shutdowns of significant portions of the basin\u2019s pipeline takeaway capacity. A temporary or permanent closure of the DAPL (which transports approximately 40% of the crude oil that is produced in the Bakken), as a result of the ongoing litigation, new regulatory provisions under the Biden administration or otherwise, would likely have an adverse effect on overall drilling and completion as well as production activity in the Bakken area. Although transport of product from the Bakken shale area historically has also occurred by rail and other means, there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient future takeaway capacity. Any temporary or permanent reduction in pipeline takeaway capacity, including the DAPL, or other constraints or disruptions impacting product transport by rail or other means, could harm our customers\u2019 business operations and, as a result, significantly reduce the demand or pricing for our services in the impacted region. Any such reduction in demand or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe implementation by governmental bodies of tariffs or trade quotas, or changes to certain inter-governmental trade agreements, could, among other things, increase the costs of fuel or equipment used in our business, or negatively impact our customers\u2019 business in a manner that reduces demand for our services. To the extent we incur fuel price increases, we may not be able to recover such increases through pricing increases or fuel price surcharges, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny interruption in our services due to pipeline ruptures or spills or necessary maintenance could impair our financial performance and negatively affect our brand.\nOur water transport pipelines are susceptible to ruptures and spills, particularly during start up and initial operation, and require ongoing inspection and maintenance. We may experience difficulties in maintaining the operation of our pipelines, which may cause downtime and delays. We also may be required to periodically shut down all or part of our pipelines for regulatory compliance and inspection purposes. Any interruption in our services due to pipeline breakdowns or necessary maintenance, inspection or regulatory compliance could reduce revenues and earnings and result in remediation costs. While we have business interruption insurance coverage for our pipeline which would help mitigate lost revenues and remediation costs should a rupture, spill or other shut-down occur, there can be no assurances as to how much lost revenue or remediation costs our business interruption insurance would cover, if any. Transportation interruptions at our pipelines, even if only temporary, could severely harm our business and reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur business is subject to risks, many of which are beyond our control. We are self-insured for many of these risks, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all insured losses that we might incur in our operations.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards, including accidents or equipment failures that can cause pollution and other damage to the environment, injuries to persons or property and interruptions in business operations. Pursuant to applicable law, we may be required to remediate the environmental impact of any such accidents or incidents, which may include costs related to site investigation and soil, groundwater and surface water cleanup as well as penalties, damages or other costs of remediation. In addition, hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, fires, explosions, pollution and other damage to the environment, and hydrocarbon spills may delay or halt operations at locations we service.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or a series of events that together are significant, or adverse claims in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that are not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe self-insure against a significant portion of these liabilities. For losses in excess of our self-insurance limits, we maintain insurance from unaffiliated commercial carriers. However, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations. We maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, the coverage provided by such insurance may exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination or otherwise be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could make such insurance prohibitively expensive.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies or our customers\u2019 operating methodologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, technological changes in our customers\u2019 operating methods could decrease the need for management of water and other wellsite environmental services or otherwise affect demand for our services.\nWe may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics (including the recent COVID-19 outbreak) and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could severely disrupt our business operations or reduce customer demand for our services.\nAdverse weather conditions (including significant weather events related to climate change), natural disasters, floods, pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of terrorism and other catastrophic or geopolitical events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, or could result in market disruption or reduced customer demand for our services, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAreas in which we operate are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, our customers may curtail their operations or we may be unable to move our trucks between locations or provide other services, thereby reducing demand for, or our ability to provide services and generate revenues. For example, many municipalities impose weight restrictions on the roads that lead to our customers\u2019 job sites in the spring due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws, limiting our access and our ability to provide service in these areas. In addition, the regions in which we operate have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods and tornadoes. In certain areas, our business may be dependent on our customers\u2019 ability to access sufficient water supplies to support their hydraulic fracturing operations. To the extent severe drought conditions or other factors prevent our customers from accessing adequate water supplies, our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur financial and operating performance may be affected by the inability to renew landfill operating permits, obtain new landfills and expand existing ones.\nWe currently own one landfill and our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives may depend, in part, on our ability to acquire, lease, or renew landfill operating permits, expand existing landfills and develop new landfill sites. It has become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain required permits and approvals to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills. We may not be able to obtain new landfill sites or expand the permitted capacity of our landfills when necessary. In addition, we may be unable to make the contingent consideration payment required upon the issuance of a second special waste disposal permit to expand the current landfill. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited. Future changes in ownership could eliminate or limit our use of net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal and state income tax liabilities is subject to certain requirements, limitations and restrictions, including Internal Revenue Code Section 382 which under certain circumstances may substantially limit our ability to offset future tax liabilities with federal net operating loss carryforwards. If we undergo an ownership change, the net operating loss carryforward limitations would impose an annual limit on the amount of the taxable income that may be offset by our net operating losses generated prior to the ownership change. We have determined that an ownership change occurred on April 15, 2016 as a result of the debt restructuring that occurred during fiscal 2016. In addition, another ownership change occurred on August 7, 2017 as a result of our chapter 11\nreorganization. The limitation under Section 382 may result in federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused. Subject to the impact of those rules as a result of past or future restructuring transactions, we may be unable to use all or a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe manage our insurable risks through a combination of third party purchased policies and self-insurance, and we retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with expected losses under these programs, which exposes us to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that changes in our assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain high deductible or self-insured retention insurance policies for certain exposures including automobile liability, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, property damage and certain employee group health insurance plans. We carry policies for certain types of claims to provide excess coverage beyond the underlying policies and per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions. Because many claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial portion of our claims. Given our large deductibles, we retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with expected losses under these programs. We could suffer significant losses in any given year as a result of one or multiple claims exhausting our deductible. Our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors, which have a limited history, and by published industry development factors. The estimates inherent in these accruals are determined using actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry. If our insurance claims increase or if costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are self-insured, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate our insurance accruals, and the underlying assumptions, regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. While we believe that the recorded amounts are reasonable, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. Changes in our assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConcentration of ownership among our Significant Shareholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nTwo shareholder groups (the \u201cSignificant Shareholders\u201d) beneficially own approximately 87% of our issued and outstanding common stock and, therefore, have significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors and approving corporate transactions. As a result, the Significant Shareholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including: the election of directors; approval of mergers or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant corporate transactions; and the amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Significant Shareholders could be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders, and the Significant Shareholders would have substantial influence to cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts arise, we can provide no assurance that the Significant Shareholders would act in the best interests of other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders. In addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning common stock in companies with Significant Shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $35.0 million of total debt. Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important consequences for our operations, including requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities. Each of our debt instruments contain certain negative covenants that impose specific restrictions on us. These restrictions include, among others, our ability to incur additional debt; operationally prepay, redeem or purchase any indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; create liens; transfer collateral; enter into certain merger, consolidation, reorganization, or recapitalization transactions; and merge, consolidate, or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets. We are also subject to a limitation on annual capital expenditures and debt service coverage ratio and must maintain a $7 million positive working capital position at all times. There are also a number of affirmative covenants with which we must comply. In addition, our $13 million equipment term loan (the \u201cEquipment Loan\u201d) is subject to all covenants and certifications required by the Main Street Priority Loan Facility (the \u201cMSPLF\u201d) as established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. A breach of any of these negative or affirmative covenants, including those under the MSPLF, could result in a default under our indebtedness. If we default, our lender will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us, and could declare all amounts of outstanding debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The results of such actions would have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify and could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nOur ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends in part on our earnings and cash flows and those of our subsidiaries and on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to us.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to service our debt is dependent, in large part, upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans, advances or other payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us depends on their earnings, capital requirements and general financial conditions and is restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as, in the future, agreements to which our subsidiaries may be a party.\nOur borrowings under our credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our credit facilities. Our credit facilities carry a floating interest rate; therefore, as interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates to 1.25% and subsequently to 0.25% in response to the escalating outbreak of the pandemic. However, there can be no assurances that interest rates will not rise in the future.\nCertain covenants in our Main Street Priority Loan Facility concerning employee compensation, stock buybacks, and distributions may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain talent and may discourage an acquisition of the Company that could otherwise benefit our shareholders.\nOur Equipment Loan is subject to the rules and regulations of the MSPLF. While MSPLF loans have various borrower friendly economic terms, the MSPLF also has long term restrictions on employee compensation, stock buybacks and distributions, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain talent and execute an acquisition, sale or other strategic transaction involving the Company. During the term of the MSPLF and for one year thereafter (the \u201cRestricted Period\u201d), employees or officers whose total compensation in 2019 exceeded $425,000 are restricted from receiving an increase in total annual compensation from 2019 levels and severance pay in excess of two times their 2019 compensation. These compensation restrictions may negatively impact our ability to attract, retain and integrate valuable and qualified talent as compared to competitors who are not subject to the MSPLF. In addition, we are restricted from paying dividends, making other capital distributions or repurchasing any equity securities listed on a national securities exchange during the Restricted Period. These restrictions may complicate a transaction to acquire us that would have otherwise involved stock buybacks, post-closing dividends or distributions of cash to shareholders, which may make a sale of the Company significantly more costly and less attractive to a buyer. In addition, the compensation restrictions may make it more difficult for a potential purchaser to retain, incentivize and motivate highly compensated individuals to remain with the Company following an acquisition. Further, the long term restrictions of the MSPLF may affect our ability to carry out an acquisition, sale or other strategic acquisition if the lender were to require our counterpart to contractually assume these restrictions or become a co-borrower or guarantor under the MSPLF.\nRisk Factors Related To Our Common Stock\nWe cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained, and the market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nWe cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will develop or, if it develops, be sustained. We currently have a limited trading volume of our common stock. In the absence of an active public trading market, it may be difficult to liquidate your investment in our common stock. The trading price of our common stock on the NYSE American may fluctuate significantly. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including our operating and financial performance and prospects; our ability to repay our debt; investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; future sales, or the availability for sale, of equity or equity-related securities; changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; limited trading volume of our common stock; and general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities, and the trading price of our common stock may not reflect accurately the value of our business.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and there are a limited number of shares available for trading on the NYSE American or any other public market. As a result, reported trading prices for our common stock at any given time may not reflect accurately the underlying economic value of our business at that time. Reported trading prices could be higher or lower than the price a shareholder would be able to receive in a sale transaction, and there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient public trading in our common stock to create a liquid trading market that accurately reflects the underlying economic value of our business.\nThe resale of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAt the time of our emergence from bankruptcy in 2017, we granted registration rights to certain stockholders. The shares of our outstanding common stock held by these stockholders were registered pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act and declared effective by the SEC on May 3, 2018. In addition, on January 3, 2019, an additional 3,220,330 shares were issued to these stockholders pursuant to a rights offering. The shares held by these stockholders constitute approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock as of February 26, 2021, all of which may be sold in the public markets.\nThe sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of our warrants, or substantial trading in our common stock or the perception in the market that substantial trading in our common stock will occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, even the perception in the public market that our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock could rely in part on the research and reporting that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future and shareholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of those shares.\nWe may raise additional capital by issuing shares of common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, which will increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding and may result in substantial dilution in the equity interest of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We had 16,002,474 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2021. The issuance, and the resale or potential resale, of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive to our shareholders.\nCertain of our charter and bylaw provisions, Delaware law, our rights plan, and the substantial ownership of our common stock by a small number of shareholders, could subject us to anti-takeover effects or could have a material negative impact on our business.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended and restated, and Delaware law, as well as our rights plan, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, deter potential acquirers of our Company, and frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management and board of directors \u201cthe Board\u201d. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders;\n\u2022establishing a classified Board, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022providing our Board with the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors occurring between shareholder meetings;\n\u2022providing that directors may only be removed for \u201ccause\u201d and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock; and\n\u2022limiting the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings.\nIn addition, on December 21, 2020, we adopted a rights agreement to implement a standard \u201cpoison pill.\u201d In general terms, for so long as the rights issued under the rights agreement are outstanding, the rights agreement prevents any person or group from acquiring a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock or attempting a hostile takeover of our Company by significantly diluting the ownership percentage of such person or group. The rights agreement, as amended, expires on December 21, 2021. As a result, the rights agreement has a significant anti-takeover effect.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years following the date the beneficial owner acquired at least 15% of our stock, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by the Board. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant percentage of common stock beneficially owned by our Significant Shareholders, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation\nWe are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation and protection of natural resources and the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for significant penalties, damages or costs of remediation. Any changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation and protection of natural resources and the environment and worker safety, including those relating to waste management and transportation and disposal of produced water and other materials. For example, we are subject to environmental regulation relating to disposal into injection wells, which can pose some risks of environmental liability, as well as liability for property damage and personal injuries. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations could increase costs to our customers and possibly decrease demand for our services. For example, many of our customers have intrastate pipeline operations that are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. If new laws and/or regulations that further regulate intrastate pipelines are adopted in response to equipment failures, spills, negative environmental effects or public sentiment, our customers may face increased costs of compliance, and thus reduce demand for our services.\nOur business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Accordingly, we are subject to health and environmental regulations established by federal, state and local authorities. We also are subject to laws, ordinances and regulations governing the investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for recycling or disposal. In particular, CERCLA imposes strict joint and several liability on owners and operators of facilities at, from, or to which a release of hazardous substances has occurred; on parties that generated hazardous substances that were released at such facilities; and on parties that transported or arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances to such facilities. A majority of states have adopted comparable statutes. Under CERCLA or a similar state statute, we could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination. Claims alleging personal injury or property damage also could be brought against us based on alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, revocation of permits and orders to limit or cease certain operations. Additionally, future events, such as the discovery of currently unknown matters, spills caused by future pipeline ruptures, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, may give rise to expenditures or liabilities, which could impair our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including regulation of the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal, could result in reduction in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells or minimize water use or disposal, which could adversely impact the demand for our services.\nDemand for our services depends, in large part, on the level of exploration and production of oil and natural gas and the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s willingness to purchase our services. Most of our customer base uses hydraulic fracturing to drill new oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is used to release hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from certain geological formations. The process involves the injection of water (typically mixed with significant quantities of sand and small quantities of chemical additives) under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate movement of hydrocarbons through the formation. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and since 2005 has been exempt from federal regulation under the SDWA, except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels.\nThe EPA has been reviewing the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. On February 11, 2014, the EPA released a revised UIC program permitting guidance for wells that use diesel fuels during hydraulic fracturing activities to clarify how companies can comply with a 2005 federal law that exempts hydraulic fracturing operations from the UIC permit requirement, except where diesel fuel is used as a fracturing fluid. On July 16, 2015, the EPA\u2019s Inspector General (IG) issued a report entitled \u201cEnhanced EPA Oversight and Action Can Further Protect Water Resources From the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing\u201d stating that the EPA should enhance its oversight of permit issuance for hydraulic fracturing by state and develop a plan for responding to concerns about chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its intention to develop a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) to require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. While the EPA\u2019s regulatory agenda previously estimated that the EPA would issue a proposed TSCA rule in June 2018, the agency withdrew the action in March 2018. The EPA\u2019s regulatory agenda stated, however, that the withdrawal does not preclude the EPA from developing a similar action in the future. On October 15, 2012, new EPA regulations under the CAA went into effect that require reductions in certain criteria and hazardous air pollutant emissions from hydraulic fracturing wells. In May 2016, the EPA issued new CAA regulations to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing. Effective September 14, 2020 the EPA rescinded certain provisions of both the 2012 and 2016 regulations. On January 20, 2021, however, the new federal Administration announced that the EPA would review the rescission pursuant to a newly issued presidential Executive Order.\nIn June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA to prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production to municipal sewage plants (called publicly owned treatment works (\u201cPOTWs\u201d)). The regulations went into effect on August 29, 2016 for most facilities, but the EPA extended the compliance date to August 29, 2019 for facilities that had been lawfully discharging extraction wastewater to POTWs prior to June 28, 2016. In December 2016, the EPA issued a final report entitled \u201cHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States\u201d that concluded that hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, but stated that the national frequency of impacts on drinking water could not be estimated due to significant data gaps and uncertainties in the available data. In March 2015, the Department of the Interior (\u201cDOI\u201d) issued regulations imposing stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing wells constructed on federal lands, but the DOI rescinded the regulations in December 2017. On January 20, 2021, however, the new federal Administration announced that the DOI would review the rescission pursuant to a newly issued presidential Executive Order. During the last several sessions of Congress, legislation has been introduced to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including, requiring disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, potentially repealing the SWDA exemption and even banning hydraulic fracturing. Similar legislation may be proposed in the future. If adopted, such legislation would add another level of regulation and permitting at the federal level for wells using hydraulic fracturing and could potentially severely restrict hydraulic fracturing. Full or partial bans on hydraulic fracturing have been enacted in some states, while laws and regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing have been adopted or are being considered in several other states, including certain states in which we operate. In November 2017, the Delaware River Basin Commission issued proposed regulations that would ban \u201chigh volume hydraulic fracturing\u201d in certain areas of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware although those regulations have not yet been finalized. Some local governments have also sought to restrict drilling.\nSome regulators have adopted or are considering additional requirements for hydraulic fracturing related to seismic activities. For example, in April 2014, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources issued new guidelines that require companies to install seismic monitors for any horizontal drilling within 3 miles of a known fault or area of seismic activity greater than 2.0 magnitude and allow regulators to halt drilling in the event of an earthquake greater than 1.0 magnitude. In Texas, the RRC amended its existing oil and natural gas disposal well regulations to require applicants for new disposal wells to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey to assess whether the RRC should impose limits on existing wells, including a temporary injection ban. Arkansas has prohibited waste-water injection in certain areas of the state due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may be related to increased earthquake activity. These and other such laws and regulations could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by our customers, and thus reduce demand for our services. Additionally, a number of states require disclosure of the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing.\nFuture United States federal, state or local laws or regulations could significantly restrict, or increase costs associated with hydraulic fracturing and make it more difficult or costly for producers to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, which could result in a decline in exploration and production. New laws and regulations, new enforcement policies by regulatory agencies and even tort litigation in some states, could also expressly restrict the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal in hydraulic fracturing and otherwise increase our costs and our customers\u2019 cost of compliance, which could minimize water use and disposal needs even if other limits on drilling and completing new wells were not imposed. Any decline in exploration and production or any restrictions on water use and disposal could result in a decline in demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities and we may be required to procure permits for construction and operation of our disposal wells and pipelines. Such permits are typically required by state agencies, but they can be required by federal and local governmental agencies as well. The requirements for such permits vary, but with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed by the permit. Delays or restrictions in obtaining salt water disposal well permits could adversely impact our growth, which is dependent in part on new disposal capacity.\nOur customers have been affected by moratoriums that have been imposed on the issuance of permits for drilling and completion activities in certain jurisdictions. For example, in December 2014, the State of New York announced a ban on high volume hydraulic fracturing in the state, and the New York legislature made the ban permanent in April 2020. A moratorium has been in place within the Delaware River Basin pending finalization of regulations by the Delaware River Basin Commission that would permanently ban high volume hydraulic fracturing in the Basin. Other states, including California, Texas, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Colorado, have enacted laws and regulations applicable to our business activities, including disclosure of information regarding the substances used in hydraulic fracturing. In December 2013, the EPA issued a revised National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit under the CWA (which became effective on March 1, 2014) that requires oil and natural gas companies using hydraulic fracturing off the coast of California to disclose the chemicals they discharge into the ocean. Although the permit technically expired on February 28, 2019, permittees have been permitted to continue their operations pending the EPA\u2019s renewal of the permit, provided that they gave the EPA timely notice of their intent to do so. Some drilling and completion activities by our customers may take place on federal land, requiring leases from the federal government to conduct such drilling and completion activities. In some cases, federal agencies have canceled oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. Moreover, on January 27, 2021 the new federal Administration imposed a moratorium on all new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and the potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on public lands. Consequently, our operations in certain areas of the country may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue and potentially having a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the trucking safety regulations, which are likely to be amended, and made stricter, as part of the initiative known as Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or \u201cCSA.\u201d If our current USDOT safety rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d is downgraded in connection with this initiative, our business and results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nAs part of the CSA initiative, the FMCSA is continuously revising its safety rating methodology and implementation of the same. These revisions will likely link safety ratings more closely to roadside inspection and driver violation data gathered and analyzed from month to month under the FMCSA\u2019s new Safety Measurement System, or \u201cSMS\u201d and may place increased scrutiny on carriers transporting significant quantities of hazardous material. This linkage could result in greater variability in safety ratings than the current system. Preliminary studies by transportation consulting firms indicate that \u201cSatisfactory\u201d ratings (or any equivalent under a new SMS-based system) may become more difficult to achieve and maintain under such a system. If our operations lose their current \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating, which is the highest and best rating under this initiative, we may lose some of our customer contracts that require such a rating, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nA failure in our operational systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational and technological systems to process a large amount of data. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses that are difficult to detect. We are heavily reliant on technology for communications, financial reporting, treasury management and many other important aspects of our business. Any failure in our operational systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational failures. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, including the ability to close our financial ledgers and report the results of our operations publicly on a timely basis or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92395, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NES"}
