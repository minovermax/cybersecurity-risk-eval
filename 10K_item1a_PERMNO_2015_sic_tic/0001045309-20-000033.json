RISK FACTORS\nThis Report contains, and our other public communications may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding expected: financial positions; results of operations; cash flows; financing plans; business strategy; operating plans; capital and other expenditures; environmental expenditures; competitive positions; growth opportunities for existing products; benefits from new technology and cost reduction initiatives, plans and objectives; and markets for securities, are forward looking. Such statements generally include the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctargets,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201csuggests,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201ccontinues\u201d or similar expressions. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections or that could cause other forward-looking statements to prove incorrect. Factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include those factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our reported results should not be considered as an indication of our future performance. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our projections and forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date those projections and statements are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the projections and forward-looking statements contained in this document, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this document. In addition to general economic, business and market conditions, we are subject to other risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the following:\nFor reference, we have divided the various significant risks to our business, financial condition, and results of operations into the following three categories: (i) key business risks; (ii) risks related to legacy matters; and (iii) risks related to financial matters, as set forth below.\nKey Business Risks\nThe global scope of our operations subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate our business on a global scale with approximately 72% of our 2019 consolidated sales outside the United States. We operate and/or sell to customers in over 60 countries and in over 30 currencies. We currently have many production facilities, research and development facilities, and administrative and sales offices located outside North America, including facilities and offices located in EMEA (Europe Middle East Africa), Asia Pacific and Latin America. We expect non-U.S. sales to continue to represent a substantial majority of our revenue. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in non-U.S. operations include the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial agreements may be more difficult to enforce and receivables more difficult to collect;\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;\n\u2022\nincreased shipping costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n\u2022\ndifficulty transferring our profits or capital from foreign operations to other countries where such funds could be more profitably deployed;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs, and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u2022\nadditional withholding and other taxes or restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including import, currency exchange and capital controls, charges and limitations;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may nationalize private enterprises;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic repercussions on a domestic, country-specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities;\nTOC-Financial Statements\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased cash taxes in the event of a change in tax laws, regulations or interpretations in one or more foreign jurisdictions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical risk, where unexpected changes in global, regional, or local political or social conditions could adversely affect our foreign operations.\nOur success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed above, recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions. We procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally to support our production. For materials sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes, tariffs or sanctions, we could potentially face increased costs, supply disruptions and/or costs associated with securing alternative materials. Additionally, such disputes, tariffs, and sanctions could potentially lead to a reduction in our sales of products, technology, and services. We view geopolitical risk along with other potential supply chain and sales risks, and work actively to diversify and mitigate these potential impacts; however, such events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we operate worldwide in a competitive environment, global economic and financial market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete by selling value-added products, technologies and services. Increased levels and numbers of competitors, globally or regionally, could negatively impact our results of operations. Economic conditions around the world can have a direct impact on our revenues. A global or regional economic downturn or market uncertainty could reduce the demand for our products, technologies and services, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Since many of our customers are refiners, our fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst business is highly dependent on the economics of the petroleum refining industry. Demand for our FCC products is affected by refinery throughput, the type and quality of refinery feedstocks, and the demand for transportation fuels and other refinery products, such as propylene. Also, disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to finance our operations and growth plans, and could negatively impact our suppliers and customers in similar manners.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate changes that impact our profitability.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risk through our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may materially affect our operating results. For example, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our competitors sell products in the same region and the cost of materials used in our operations. A substantial portion of our net sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, at a constant level of business, our reported sales, earnings, assets and liabilities are reduced because the non-U.S. currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nWe incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary\u2019s functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction risks effectively, or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk.\nPrices for certain raw materials and energy are volatile and can have a significant effect on our manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw materials and energy prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our earnings in future periods.\nWe use metals, natural gas, petroleum-based materials, and other materials in the manufacture of our products. We consume substantial amounts of energy in our manufacturing processes. Prices for these materials and energy are volatile and can have a significant effect on our pricing, sales, manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. Our ability to adjust strategies successfully in response to volatile raw material and energy prices is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our profitability. If we are\nTOC-Financial Statements\nunable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our sales and earnings in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change.\nWe attempt to manage exposure to price volatility of major commodities through:\n\u2022\nlong-term supply contracts;\n\u2022\ncontracts with customers that permit adjustments for changes in prices of commodity-based materials and energy;\n\u2022\nforward buying programs that layer in our expected requirements systematically over time; and\n\u2022\nlimited use of financial instruments.\nAlthough we regularly assess our exposure to raw material price volatility, we cannot always predict the prospects of volatility and we cannot always cover the risk in a cost effective manner.\nWe have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials. However, certain of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials due to unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for raw materials, these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier.\nIf we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other suppliers to meet their requirements.\nThe specialty chemicals and specialty materials industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience ongoing technological change and product improvements. A key element of our business strategy is to invest in research and development activities with the goal of introducing new high-performance, technically-differentiated products. We may not be successful in developing new technology and products that effectively compete with products introduced by our competitors, and our customers may not accept, or may have lower demand for, our new products. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to improve our products in response to our customers\u2019 needs, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could hurt our business.\nFrom time to time, we face infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of the claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages, and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products, pay others to use the technology, or stop using the technology or producing the infringing product. Even if we ultimately prevail, the existence of the lawsuit could prompt our customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits.\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 4,000 global employees. Approximately 700 of our approximately 2,200 U.S. employees are unionized at 5 manufacturing sites, and approximately 1,300 of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils and unions. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws in the United States. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils that have co-determination rights on any changes in conditions of employment, including certain salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. A strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our\nTOC-Financial Statements\nemployees, whether or not related to these negotiations, could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that complement or expand our businesses. We may not be able to complete proposed transactions and even if completed, the transactions may involve a number of risks that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to continue to pursue opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty identifying appropriate opportunities or, if we do identify opportunities, we may not be successful in completing transactions for a number of reasons. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business to achieve expected financial, operational, and other objectives;\n\u2022\npossible assumption of unexpected liabilities; and\n\u2022\ninability to obtain indemnification from other parties to transactions.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies.\nWe spend large amounts of money for environmental compliance in connection with our current and former operations, and may continue to do so.\nAs a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and specialty materials, we are subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of chemicals and other materials. We have expended substantial funds to comply with such laws and regulations and have established a policy to minimize our emissions to the environment. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes, and if there is an acceleration in new regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend substantial additional funds to remain in compliance, which may be material.\nWe work with dangerous materials that can injure our employees, damage our facilities, disrupt our operations, and contaminate the environment.\nSome of our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials that may pose the risk of fire, explosion, or the release of hazardous substances. Such events could result from natural disasters, operational failures or terrorist attacks, and might cause injury or loss of life to our employees and others, environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected plant, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result of any of these events. A disruption of our operations caused by these or other events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to business continuity risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant risks from both natural disasters and accidents such as fires, storms, and floods; public health concerns, including pandemics and quarantines; and disruptive events, such as war, insurrection, and terrorist actions; and other force majeure events. These types of occurrences can negatively affect our manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, information technology, and communications functions. Similarly, they can strike major suppliers and customers, thus restricting or delaying our supply of raw materials or energy as well as reducing or deferring demand for our products and services. In the event of a major disruption, we may not be able to replace this business in a timely manner or at similar margins. Also, we have centralized certain administrative functions, primarily in North America, Europe and Asia, to improve efficiency and reduce costs. To\nTOC-Financial Statements\nthe extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled, key business processes, such as invoicing, payments and general management operations, could be interrupted.\nWe insure against many of these risks by carrying property, general, liability, and other coverages with highly rated global insurers. Given the current insurance market as well as our recent claims experience, we may experience increased costs to purchase insurance coverage going forward. Our ability to obtain certain coverage, including contingent time element business interruption insurance, for losses related to our suppliers or customers may be limited or more costly in the future.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. Our IT systems affect virtually every aspect of our business, including supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, finance and communications. We and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Any IT system failure, natural disaster, accident, or intentional breach could result in disruptions to our operations.\nOur ability to operate our businesses and our financial condition could be significantly undermined by cybersecurity breaches.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are subject to cyberattack and other similar disruptions. Breaches by hackers, the introduction of computer viruses, ransomware, and other cybersecurity incidents affecting our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. Also, such incidents could include theft of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, as well as confidential customer, employee and business information, which could be used by unauthorized parties and publicly disclosed. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers and our ability to compete effectively, and could ultimately harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by cybersecurity breaches in the future.\nRisks Related to Legacy Matters\nWe are subject to liabilities for Legacy Matters, which include (i) product, (ii) environmental, and (iii) other liabilities, relating to past activities of Grace.\nIn addition to the legacy product and legacy environmental liabilities discussed below in these Risk Factors, we are subject to other liabilities relating to past activities of Grace. On April 3, 2019, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation issued a five-year operating permit for a dam at the Libby mine site. We constructed the dam in 1971 to prevent vermiculite ore tailings from moving into nearby creeks and rivers. The permit requires us to complete construction of a new spillway before the permit is further renewed in five years. We contracted a third-party engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of cost estimates for the project. Based on this work, we recorded pre-tax charges of $68.0 million in 2019 for the estimated costs of the project. These costs are preliminary and may vary significantly as the project progresses. Based on the consultants\u2019 estimates, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of this project could range between $50 million and $100 million.\nWe are subject to environmental clean-up costs, fines, penalties and damage claims that have been and continue to be costly.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions, in connection with current and former operations (including some divested businesses and off-site disposal facilities), that seek clean-up or other remedies. We are also subject to similar risks outside of the U.S.\nWe operated a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, until 1990. Some of the vermiculite ore that was mined at the Libby mine contained naturally occurring asbestos. We are engaged with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or the \u201cEPA\u201d) and other federal, state and local governmental agencies in a remedial investigation and feasibility study (or the \u201cRI/FS\u201d) of the Libby mine and the surrounding area, known as Operable Unit 3 (or \u201cOU3\u201d).\nTOC-Financial Statements\nThe RI/FS will determine the specific areas within OU3 requiring remediation and will identify possible remedial action alternatives. Possible remedial actions within OU3 are wide-ranging, from institutional controls such as land use restrictions, to more active measures involving soil removal, containment projects, or other protective measures. As part of the RI/FS process, we contracted an engineering and consulting firm to develop a range of possible remedial alternatives and associated cost estimates for OU3. Based on this work, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $70.0 million in the 2018 third quarter for the estimated costs of remediation of OU3. We believe that this amount should provide for a protective remedy meeting the statutory requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.\nThe estimated costs of remediation are preliminary and consist of several components, each of which may vary significantly as the remedial alternatives are further developed and analyzed by the regulatory bodies providing oversight. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate costs of remediation could range between $30 million and $170 million. The ultimate remedy will be determined by the EPA after the RI/FS is finalized. Such remedy will be set forth in a Record of Decision (or \u201cROD\u201d) that is currently expected to be issued by the EPA no earlier than 2021. Costs associated with the more active remedial alternatives would be expected to be incurred over a decade or more. We will reevaluate our estimated liability as remedial alternatives evolve based on further work by the engineering and consulting firm and discussions with the EPA as the RI/FS process moves toward a ROD. Technical memoranda expected prior to the issuance of the ROD may provide insight into the likely remedial alternatives ultimately selected, allowing Grace to update its cost of remediation estimate. Depending on the remedial alternatives that the EPA selects in the ROD, the total cost of remediating OU3 may exceed our current estimate by material amounts.\nThe EPA is also investigating or remediating formerly owned or operated sites that processed Libby vermiculite into finished products. We have cooperated with the EPA on these investigation and remediation activities. We have recorded a liability for remaining expected EPA response and oversight costs, and for potential future site remediation, where a review has indicated that liability is probable and the cost is estimable. The EPA may commence additional investigations in the future at other sites that processed Libby vermiculite. Liability for unaccrued additional investigation and remediation costs is probable but not yet estimable, and could be material.\nWe have recorded liabilities for all environmental matters for which a loss is considered to be probable and sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the loss. We also face legacy environmental liability for response costs at sites not related to our former vermiculite mining and processing activities. This liability relates to our former businesses or operations, including our share of liability at off-site disposal facilities. Our estimated liability is based upon regulatory requirements and environmental conditions at each site. As we receive new information, our estimated liability may increase materially.\nWe may be required to make one or more contingent deferred payments to the trust for asbestos property damage claims, which we refer to as the \u201cPD Trust,\u201d in respect of claims related to our former Zonolite attic insulation (\u201cZAI\u201d) product (\u201cZAI PD Claims\u201d); we may also be obligated to make additional payments to the PD Trust in respect of \u201cOther PD Claims\u201d (those being asbestos property damage claims other than ZAI PD Claims); and our obligations to make payments to the PD Trust in respect of Other PD Claims is not capped.\nGrace emerged from bankruptcy effective February 3, 2014 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). Under the Joint Plan, the PD Trust was established and funded under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The order of the Bankruptcy Court confirming the Joint Plan contains a channeling injunction, which provides that all pending and future asbestos-related property damage claims and demands (or \u201cPD Claims\u201d) can only be brought against the PD Trust. The PD Trust contains two accounts. One of these accounts is the \u201cZAI PD Account,\u201d which is funded in respect of claims related to ZAI. The other account is the \u201cPD Account,\u201d which is funded solely in respect of Other PD Claims.\nUnder the Joint Plan, all pending and future asbestos-related personal injury claims are channeled for resolution to a personal injury trust (the \u201cPI Trust\u201d). We have satisfied all of our financial obligations to the PI Trust. We have contingent financial obligations remaining to the PD Trust. With respect to ZAI PD Claims, the PD Trust was funded with $49.4 million (net of $15 million of attorneys\u2019 fees) to pay claims and expenses. We are also obligated to make up to 10 contingent deferred payments of $8 million per year to the PD Trust during the 20-year period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, with each such payment due only if the assets of the PD Trust fall below $10 million during the preceding year. As of December 31, 2019, the PD Trust has paid out\nTOC-Financial Statements\napproximately $29 million in ZAI PD Claims and expenses, leaving a balance of approximately $23 million, including the benefit of realized investment gains.\nDue to the limited claims history, the unique nature of this product, and the uncertainty of future claims patterns, an actuarial analysis was completed to estimate the range of possible future payments. The analysis was conducted by a third-party actuarial firm directed by us and using historical claims data provided by the ZAI trustee. Certain key assumptions employed in the analysis were (1) projections of the future number of filed claims, assuming a percentage increase in claims during earlier years and annual decreases in later years; (2) application of historical percentages of claims closed with indemnity payment compared to total closed claims, applied on a regional basis; and (3) application of the average claim payout, which reflects the average indemnity cost per claim closing with payment. As a result of the analysis and taking into account the relative uncertainty of future claims activity, we determined that contingent funding obligations beyond the next five years are not reasonably estimable. We estimate that the reasonable range of payments over the next five years is expected to be between $16 million and $24 million and project that the first payment could be due in 2022. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we recorded a reserve in the amount of $24 million related to probable future obligations to fund the PD Trust for ZAI PD Claims. Our maximum financial obligation over the next 19 years is $80 million, and no single year\u2019s obligation can exceed $8 million.\nWith respect to Other PD Claims, claims unresolved as of the Effective Date are to be litigated in the bankruptcy court and any future claims are to be litigated in a federal district court, in each case pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court. To the extent any such Other PD Claims are determined to be allowed claims, they are to be paid in cash by the PD Trust. We are obligated to make a payment to the PD Trust every six months in the amount of any Other PD Claims allowed during the preceding six months plus interest (if applicable) and the amount of PD Trust expenses for the preceding six months (the \u201cPD Obligation\u201d). We have not paid any Other PD Claims since emergence. Annual expenses have been approximately $0.2 million per year. The aggregate amount to be paid under the PD Obligation is not capped, and we may be obligated to make additional payments to the PD Trust in respect of the PD Obligation. We have accrued for those unresolved Other PD Claims that we believe are probable and estimable. We have not accrued for other unresolved or unasserted Other PD Claims as we do not believe that payment is probable.\nAll payments to the PD Trust required after the Effective Date are secured by the Company\u2019s obligation to issue 77,372,257 shares of Company common stock to the PD Trust in the event of default, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nOur indebtedness may materially affect our business, including our ability to fulfill our obligations, react to changes in our business and incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,042.3 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding and $938.1 million of secured indebtedness outstanding. Our indebtedness may have material effects on our business, including to:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to principal and interest payments, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, distributions to shareholders (which fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors taking into account financial, liquidity and other considerations), share repurchase programs and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic, credit and industry conditions, including recessions;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other purposes.\nIf we incur additional debt, the risks related to our indebtedness may intensify.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nRestrictions imposed by agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business, finance our future operations or capital needs, or engage in other business activities. If we fail to comply with certain restrictions under these agreements, our debt could be accelerated, and we may not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated debt.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit, among other things, our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our guarantors.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our flexibility to operate our business. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements, including maintaining the financial ratios required by our credit facilities, could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. We cannot guarantee that our future operating results will be sufficient to enable us to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, we will be required to offer to purchase our senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOur indebtedness exposes us to interest expense increases if interest rates increase.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $293.5 million of our borrowings were at variable interest rates and expose us to interest rate risk, excluding $592.5 million hedged by cross-currency swaps effective in November 2018, and $100.0 million hedged by interest rate swaps effective in April 2018. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income would decrease. An increase of 100 basis points in the interest rates payable on our variable rate indebtedness would increase our annual estimated debt-service requirements by $2.9 million, assuming our consolidated variable interest rate indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2019, remains the same.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe currently have term loan borrowings, a revolving credit facility and financial derivatives that rely on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark rate. LIBOR is expected to be phased out as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021, when private sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. Without this data, LIBOR may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. No consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR at this time, although the U.S. Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.\nGiven the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and the impact on our cost of variable rate debt, including the use of certain financial derivatives. We will also need to consider new contracts and determine if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate and/or include suggested fallback language, as published by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods; however, they could result in a change in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments, which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nTOC-Financial Statements\nWe have unfunded and underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require future operating cash flow to fund these liabilities. We have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations.\nWe maintain U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees who meet or met age and service requirements. Our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Assets available to fund the pension benefit obligation of the U.S. advance-funded pension plans at December 31, 2019, were approximately $956 million, or approximately 93% of the measured pension projected benefit obligation on a U.S. GAAP basis. In addition, any changes in the discount rate, as well as actual returns on plan assets, could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years.\nOur ability to use tax credits and / or net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of Grace or if Grace does not generate sufficient taxable income or foreign source income for U.S. tax purposes. Our ability to use these attributes is also subject to time limitations. Changes in tax laws and regulations may reduce their value and availability.\nOur ability to utilize tax attributes including tax credits, future tax deductions, and net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income for U.S. tax purposes. Under U.S. income tax law, federal tax credits may be carried forward for 10 years, and research and development tax credits may be carried forward for 20 years. State NOL carryforwards are generally available for deduction against future taxable income for up to 20 years, subject to state-specific regulations. Also, our ability to realize the benefits of these tax credits and/or NOLs and their value may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations. In addition, our ability to utilize U.S. federal tax credits as well as state NOLs may be limited in the event of future changes in the ownership of outstanding Company common stock.", "PERMNO": 85908, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "GRA"}
