In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and such impact could recur and last for an unknown period of time.\n\u2022Intense competition exists in the gaming and entertainment industries, and we expect competition to continue to intensify.\n\u2022Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside of our control.\n\u2022Our results of operations may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results will not be guarantees of future performance.\n\u2022Inclement weather, acts or threats of terrorism, and other casualty events could seriously disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\u2022Negative events or negative media coverage including relating to, or a declining popularity of, sports betting, the underlying sports, teams or athletes and related talent, and/or online gaming may adversely impact our reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022Our projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties, including assumptions regarding future legislation and changes in regulations, both inside and outside of the United States. As a result, our projected revenues and profitability may differ materially from our expectations.\n\u2022Consolidation among gaming equipment manufacturers could impose additional costs on us.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\u2022We have certain properties that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these properties.\n\u2022We are required to utilize a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make our rent payments under our Triple Net Leases, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\n\u2022Most of our facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property.\n\u2022Our operations could be disrupted if management agreements and/or leases with third parties and local governments are not renewed.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or generate sufficient returns on our recently expanded sports betting operations, our acquisition of theScore and our investment in Barstool Sports.\n\u2022Our operations and the success of our investment in Barstool Sports are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\n\u2022Our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain talented team members.\n\u2022Collective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs, and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.\n\u2022If we fail to detect fraud or theft, including by our users and employees, our reputation may suffer which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and can subject us to investigations and litigation.\n\u2022We rely on, among other things, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect or may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Our commercial success depends upon us avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and any such infringements, including those that are inadvertent, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Our technology contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our offerings.\n\u2022We may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing properties or other initiatives we have recently acquired, may develop, or may acquire in the future.\n\u2022We rely on a variety of third-party providers to support our business, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of employee information, customer information or other breaches of information security, particularly as our online gaming division grows.\n\u2022Our growth prospects may suffer if we are unable to develop successful offerings or if we fail to pursue additional offerings. In addition, if we fail to make the right investment decisions in our offerings and technology, we may not attract and retain key users and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\n\u2022The growth of our Interactive segment will depend on our ability to attract and retain users.\n\u2022Participation in the sports betting industry exposes us to trading, liability management and pricing risk. We may experience lower than expected profitability and potentially significant losses as a result of a failure to determine accurately the odds in relation to any particular event and/or any failure of its sports risk management processes.\n\u2022We follow the industry practice of restricting and managing betting limits at the individual customer level based on individual customer profiles and risk level to the enterprise; however, there is no guarantee that states will allow operators such as us to place limits at the individual customer level.\n\u2022We extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\n\u2022The success, including win or hold rates, of existing or future online gaming and sports betting products depends on a variety of factors and is not completely controlled by us.\n\u2022We face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming properties or launching new online gaming or sports betting channels, which may lead to increased costs and delays in anticipated revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\n\u2022Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\n\u2022The lack of availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We face extensive regulation from gaming authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022We are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations, and if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\u2022State and local smoking restrictions have and may continue to negatively affect our business.\n\u2022Changes to consumer privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively and may require us to change our business practices or expend significant amounts on compliance with such laws.\n\u2022We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities which could have an adverse effect on us.\n\u2022In the event we make another acquisition, we may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete, or other delays or impediments to completing, such acquisition.\n\u2022Material increases to our taxes or the adoption of new taxes or the authorization of new or increased forms of gaming could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nThe summary risk factors described above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below and in the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks summarized above or described in full below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy, including the gaming industry, and has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and may continue to do so.\nThe closing of our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to our ability to generate revenues, profitability, and cash flows and had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. While all our properties are currently open, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to fluctuate, and future closures may be appropriate or could be mandated. Future disruptions, as well as significant negative economic trends, due to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our stock price.\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration, and impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and stock price.\nIntense competition exists in the gaming, media, and entertainment industries, and we expect competition to continue to intensify.\nThe gaming, media and entertainment industries are characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants.\nIn a broad sense, both our land-based and interactive gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. It is possible that these secondary competitors could reduce the number of visitors to our facilities or the amount they are willing to wager, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or maintain our profitability and cash flows.\nLegalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to those in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. Competition from gaming options such as state-sponsored internet lotteries, sweepstakes, charitable gaming, video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants, taverns and truck stops, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, including online gaming and sports betting, could divert customers from our properties and our online gaming and sports betting apps and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our properties compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where they are located, including on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas. We and our competitors have invested in expanding existing facilities, developing new facilities, and acquiring established facilities in existing markets. This expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing\nstrategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete, and this intense competition can be expected to continue. As competing properties and new markets open, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIncreased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties, including making expenditures to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities, including increasing the manner and frequency in which we refresh, refurbish or replace fixtures and equipment at our properties. Because of our leverage, after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nSimilarly, there is intense competition among online gaming and sports betting providers. A number of established, well-financed companies producing online gaming and/or interactive entertainment products and services compete with our offerings, and other well-capitalized companies may introduce competitive services. Such competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products and services, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing or promotional policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products or services than ours, which could negatively impact our business. There has also been considerable consolidation among competitors in the interactive gaming sectors and such consolidation and future consolidation could result in the formation of larger competitors with increased financial resources and altered cost structures, which may enable them to offer more competitive products, gain a larger market share, expand offerings and broaden their geographic scope of operations. If we are not able to maintain or improve our market share, or if our offerings do not continue to be popular, our business could suffer.\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside of our control.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, any future employment and credit crisis, the impact of high and prolonged inflation, particularly with respect to housing, energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, fears of war and future acts of terrorism, or widespread illnesses or epidemics, including COVID-19, can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and could further reduce customer demand for the products and amenities that we offer, which may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results will not be guarantees of future performance.\nOur online sportsbook and core business operations may fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. A majority of our current online sports betting revenue is and will continue to be generated from bets placed on, or contests relating to, college and professional football and basketball, which have been highest in the fourth quarter when most of these games occur. Significant sporting events, such as the playoffs and championship games from these sports, tend to impact, among other things, revenues from operations, key metrics and customer activity. This seasonality may cause decreases in our future revenues during the applicable off-seasons. In addition, certain individuals or teams advancing or failing to advance and their scores and other results within specific tournaments, games or events may impact our financial performance. Our land-based gaming operations are also subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate, specific holidays, or other significant events.\nThe operations of our properties are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters, acts or threats of terrorism, concerns about contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other casualty events, such as hurricanes or tornados. We maintain significant property insurance, including business interruption coverage, for these types of casualty events; however, if any such events occur, there can be no assurances that we will be fully or promptly compensated, if at all, for losses at any of our properties in the event of future inclement weather or casualty events or from the closings of our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other contagious disease. In addition, the occurrence of such an event may adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nNegative events or negative media coverage including relating to, or a declining popularity of, sports betting, the underlying sports, teams or athletes and related talent, online gaming may adversely impact our reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nPublic opinion can significantly influence our business. Unfavorable publicity regarding us or regarding the actions of third parties with whom we have relationships or the underlying sports (including declining popularity of the sports or athletes) could seriously harm our reputation. In addition, a negative shift in the perception of sports betting and online gaming by the public or by politicians, lobbyists or others could affect future legislation of sports betting and online gaming. Negative public perception could also lead to new restrictions on or to the prohibition of online gaming or sports betting in jurisdictions in which we currently operate. Such negative publicity could also adversely affect: (i) the size, demographics, engagement, and loyalty of our customer base and result in decreased revenue or slower user growth rates; (ii) our ability to retain and attract team members; and (iii) investor perception, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nOur investment in and partnership with Barstool Sports may result in potential adverse reactions, negative publicity or changes to our business, regulatory or other stakeholder relationships. Our relationships with state gaming regulators, stakeholders and business partners could be adversely affected as a result of our affiliation with Barstool Sports. In addition, our business partners or stakeholders may react negatively to actual or perceived competitive threats from our affiliation with Barstool Sports and the individuals, influencers, and/or media personalities connected with Barstool Sports.\nOur projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties, including assumptions regarding future legislation and changes in regulations, both inside and outside of the United States. As a result, our projected revenues and profitability may differ materially from our expectations.\nWe operate in rapidly changing and competitive industries and our projections are subject to the risks and assumptions made by management with respect to our industries. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on our assessment of the timing of adoption of future legislation and regulations by different states, which are uncertain. Furthermore, if we invest in the development of new products or distribution channels, such as our expanded media business and non-gaming land-based entertainment, that do not achieve significant commercial success or deliver projected results, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial \u201cup front\u201d costs of developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels.\nConsolidation among gaming equipment manufacturers, or supply chain delays, could impose additional costs on us.\nA majority of our revenues are attributable to gaming devices and related systems operated by us at our gaming properties. A substantial majority of the gaming devices sold in the U.S. are manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation of such manufacturers in recent years, diminishing our ability to negotiate competitive pricing. This inability could cause us to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines, which could hurt our profitability. Our business could also be impacted if gaming equipment manufacturers experience supply chain delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as semiconductor chip shortages.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe have certain land-based properties that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these properties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated 15.6%, 9.6%, and 14.4% of our revenues from our land-based properties within the states of Louisiana, Missouri, and Ohio, respectively. Additionally, we generated 5.4% of our revenues from our property in Charles Town, West Virginia. Therefore, our results will be dependent on the regional economies and competitive landscapes at these properties. Likewise, our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these properties.\nWe are required to utilize a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make our rent payments under our Triple Net Leases, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to utilize a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make our rent payments, which were $912.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of our Master Leases, Meadows Lease, Perryville Lease, Tropicana Lease and Morgantown Lease each with GLPI, and our Margaritaville Lease and\nGreektown Lease with VICI (as defined previously, collectively, our \u201cTriple Net Leases\u201d). As a result of these commitments under our Triple Net Leases, our ability to fund our own operations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. Further, our obligations under the Triple Net Leases may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness and restrict our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMost of our facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property.\nWe lease 37 of the facilities we operate, or plan to operate, pursuant to the Triple Net Leases. Termination of the Penn Master Lease, Pinnacle Master Lease, or Morgantown Lease could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, as a lessee, we do not completely control the land and improvements underlying our operations, and our landlords under the Triple Net Leases could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the facilities leased under the Triple Net Leases that are beyond our control. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Triple Net Leases even if we decided to withdraw from those locations. Further, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our obligations under the Triple Net Leases in the future or that our landlords will be able to comply with their obligations under the Triple Net Leases with us.\nOur operations could be disrupted if management agreements and/or leases with third parties and local governments are not renewed.\nOur operations in several jurisdictions depend on land leases and/or management and development agreements with third parties and local governments. If we, or if GLPI or VICI in the case of leases pursuant to which we are the sub-lessee, are unable to renew these leases and agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire or if disputes arise regarding the terms of these agreements, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or generate sufficient returns on our recently expanded sports betting operations, our recent acquisition of theScore and our investment in Barstool Sports.\nCertain of the jurisdictions in which we operate have legalized intra-state sports wagering and have established extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements governing any such intra-state sports wagering. As of December 31, 2021, we have launched the Barstool Sportsbook app in eleven states, and we expect to launch our Barstool Sportsbook app in additional states throughout 2022. Our sports betting operations compete, and will continue to compete, in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors.\nAdditionally, as described below under \u201c- We rely on strategic relationships with casinos, tribes and horse-tracks in order to be able to offer our sports betting and online gaming products in certain jurisdictions. If we cannot establish and manage such relationships with such partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,\u201d we have entered into agreements with other sports betting operators and may enter into additional agreements with strategic partners and other third-party vendors to provide market access in certain jurisdictions. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Barstool Sports audience will engage in sports betting and online gaming products to the extent that we expect. Further, the success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States and Canada; our ability to gain market share in a new market; the timeliness and the technological and popular viability of our products; our ability to compete with new entrants in the market; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; cancellations and delays in sporting seasons and sporting matches as a result of events such as players strikes or lockouts or related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that our expansion will be successful and generate sufficient returns on our investment.\nAny of the factors above could prevent us from receiving the expected returns of our acquisition of theScore or our investment in Barstool Sports, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operations and the success are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nOur success and our competitive position, including as relates to our land-based operations, online sports betting, iGaming and media businesses, are largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. Although we enter into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.\nOur business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain talented team members.\nWe compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop, and retain sufficient numbers of talented team members to our corporate, land-based operations, online sports betting, iGaming and media businesses, we could experience increased employee turnover, decreased guest or user satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures. Insufficient numbers of talented team members could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses. A shortage of frontline and skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs, which could reduce our profits. We may also experience adverse impacts to our business if certain government-mandated measures intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as mandatory quarantines, vaccine mandates and regular testing requirements, affect the availability of our employees or other workers or lead to attrition of key employees.\nAs our Interactive segment grows, we will need to recruit, integrate, and retain skilled and experienced personnel who can demonstrate our value proposition to users, advertisers, and business partners and who can increase the monetization of our products. Qualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the media industry, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We use equity awards to attract talented employees. If the value of our ordinary shares declines significantly and remains depressed, that may prevent us from recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility.\nCollective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs, and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.\nA significant number of team members at our properties are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements. Numerous collective bargaining agreements are typically subject to negotiation each year, and our ability in the past to resolve such negotiations does not mean that we will be able to resolve future negotiations without strikes, disruptions, or on terms that we consider reasonable. If relationships with our organized associates or the unions that represent them become adverse, then the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts, and public demonstrations. Labor disputes and disruptions have in the past, and could in the future, result in adverse publicity and adversely affect operations and revenues at affected properties. In addition, labor disputes and disruptions could harm our relationship with our team members, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities, harm our relationships with our guests and customers, divert management attention, and reduce customer demand for our services, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses and legal costs, and could impose limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. We do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by the operators of our franchised properties.\nGiven the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry, and, we have experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. These efforts have achieved some success to date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our results of operations. Increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.\nIf we fail to detect fraud or theft, including by our users and employees, our reputation may suffer which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and can subject us to investigations and litigation.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of financial fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of unauthorized payments by a user and attempted payments by users with\ninsufficient funds. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for use of funds on our products with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction.\nActs of fraud may involve various tactics, including collusion. Successful exploitation of our systems could have negative effects on our product offerings, services and user experience and could harm our reputation. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in harm to our operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our existing technology or product offerings, substantial engineering and marketing resources and management attention may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nIn addition, any misappropriation of, or access to, users\u2019 or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, force us to modify our business practices, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from our users, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDespite measures we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our offerings, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on, among other things, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect or may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop new or improved technologies and products, and to successfully obtain or acquire proprietary or statutory protection for our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on, among other things, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. While we enter into license, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, users, potential users and others to attempt to limit access to and distribution of proprietary and confidential information, it is possible that:\n\u2022some or all of our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be honored;\n\u2022third parties will independently develop equivalent technology or misappropriate our technology or designs;\n\u2022disputes will arise with our strategic partners, users or others concerning the ownership of intellectual property;\n\u2022unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property, including source code, know-how or trade secrets will occur; or\n\u2022contractual provisions may not be enforceable.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or that we will become aware of third-party infringements that might be occurring. Inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur commercial success depends upon us avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and any such infringements, including those that are inadvertent, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe industries in which we compete have many participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property, including participants that have been issued patents and may have filed patent applications or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights for technologies similar to those used by us in our products. Some of these patents may grant very broad protection to the third-party owners thereof. Patents can be issued very rapidly and there is often a great deal of secrecy surrounding pending patent applications. We cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third-party patents or the issuance of any new third-party patents would require us to alter our technologies, pay for licenses, challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents, or cease certain activities. Third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our partners and/or suppliers. We may be subject to these types of claims either directly or indirectly\nthrough indemnities assuming liability for these claims that we may provide to certain partners. There can be no assurance that our attempts to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities in favor of us with our suppliers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights will be successful or that a supplier\u2019s indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our partners and other suppliers due to infringing products, or that we can secure a license, modification or replacement of a supplier\u2019s products with non-infringing products that may otherwise mitigate such damages and losses.\nSome of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies that have, substantially greater resources than us, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property infringement litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than us. Regardless of whether third-party claims of infringement against us have any merit, these claims could:\n\u2022adversely affect our relationships with our customers and users;\n\u2022be time-consuming to evaluate and defend;\n\u2022result in costly litigation;\n\u2022result in negative publicity for us;\n\u2022divert our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022cause product and software delivery delays or stoppages;\n\u2022subject us to significant liabilities;\n\u2022require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements;\n\u2022require us to develop possible workaround solutions that may be costly and disruptive to implement; or\n\u2022require us to cease certain activities or to cease distributing our products and delivering our services in certain markets.\nIn addition to being liable for potentially substantial damages relating to a patent or other intellectual property following an infringement action against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain technologies or products unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other applicable intellectual property rights, or purchase the patent. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license or purchase the patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not obtain such a license, our prospects, business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to cease related business operations in some markets and restructure our business to focus on continuing operations in other markets.\nOur technology contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our offerings.\nOur technology contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our technology to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our technology. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our technology will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our technology, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally\navailable, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing acquired operations or other initiatives we have recently acquired, may develop, or may acquire in the future.\nWe could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties or operations we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets or business lines, including our recent acquisition of theScore. The integration and management of more significant operations that we develop or acquire, such as our ability to (i) transition to the Score\u2019s proprietary risk and trading platform in Ontario, (ii) integrate the Barstool Sportsbook into theScore\u2019s mobile app in the U.S. and (iii) migrate the Barstool Sportsbook to theScore\u2019s player account management trading platforms, will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. In addition, development and integration of new information technology systems that may be required is costly and time-consuming. The process of integrating operations that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the development of new operations may involve regulatory, legal and competitive risks, and, as it relates to property acquisitions construction and local opposition risks, as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In particular, local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project, and, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or if our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or development projects. We also cannot assure you that if acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations.\nOur ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of some or all of the above-described events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur retail casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power.\nAny unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our retail casino gaming (including slot machines and security systems), online gaming, and sports betting operations.\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by our users, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by our users. If any of our third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to our users, any of which could make our technology less trustworthy and convenient and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our users.\nNearly all of our payments are made by credit card, debit card or through other third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to users that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from our users, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could\nmake our offerings less convenient and attractive to our users. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our payment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or our users violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our third-party mobile application distribution platforms or service providers do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers. We rely upon third-party distribution platforms, including the Apple App Store and Google Play store, for distribution of our mobile applications. As such, the promotion, distribution and operation of our mobile applications are subject to the respective distribution platforms\u2019 standard terms and policies, which are very broad and subject to frequent changes and interpretation. If Apple or Google choose to de-list any of our mobile applications due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a material negative impact on our business.\nFurther, the success of our Interactive segment depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers for content delivery, load balancing and protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks. If those providers do not perform adequately or terminate their relationship with us, our users may experience issues or interruptions with their experiences. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners could adversely affect our reputation and brand.\nWe also incorporate technology from third parties into our platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our offerings containing that technology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we rely on third-party geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we are in compliance with certain laws and regulations. There is no guarantee that the third-party geolocation and identity verification systems will perform adequately, or be effective, and any service disruption to those systems would prohibit us from operating our platform and would adversely affect our business. Additionally, incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from third-party service providers may result in us inadvertently allowing access to our offerings to individuals who should not be permitted to access them, or otherwise inadvertently deny access to individuals who should be able to access our offerings, in each case based on inaccurate identity or geographic location determination. Our third-party geolocation services provider relies on its ability to obtain information necessary to determine geolocation from mobile devices, operating systems, and other sources. Changes, disruptions or temporary or permanent failure to access such sources by our third-party services providers may result in their inability to accurately determine the location of our users. Moreover, our inability to maintain our existing contracts with third-party services providers, or to replace them with equivalent third parties, may result in our inability to access geolocation and identity verification data necessary for our day-to-day operations. If any of these risks materializes, we may be subject to disciplinary action, fines, lawsuits, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf Internet and other technology-based service providers experience service interruptions, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties, including Internet service providers and other technology-based service providers. See \u201c- We rely on third party cloud infrastructure services to deliver our offerings to users and any disruption of or interference with our use of these services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\u201d We require technology-based service providers to implement cyber-attack-resilient systems and processes. However, if Internet service providers experience service interruptions, including because of cyber-attacks, or due to an event causing an unusually high volume of Internet use (such as a pandemic or public health emergency), communications over the Internet may be interrupted and impair our ability to conduct our business. Internet service providers and other technology-based service providers may in the future roll out upgraded or new mobile or other telecommunications services, such as 5G or 6G services, which may not be successful and thus may impact the ability of our users to access our offerings in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, our ability to process e-commerce transactions depends on bank processing and credit card systems. To prepare for system problems, we continuously seek to strengthen and enhance our current facilities and the capabilities of our system infrastructure and support. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the Internet infrastructure or our own network systems will continue to be able to meet the demand placed on us by the continued growth of the Internet, the overall online gaming industry and our users. Any difficulties these providers face, including the potential of certain network traffic receiving priority over other traffic (i.e., lack of net neutrality), may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Any system failure as a result of reliance on third parties, such as network, software or hardware failure, including as a result of cyber-attacks, which causes a loss of our users\u2019 property or personal information or a delay or interruption in our online services and products and e-commerce services, including our ability to handle existing or increased traffic, could result in a loss of anticipated revenue, interruptions to our offerings, cause us to incur significant legal, remediation and notification costs, degrade the customer experience and cause users to lose confidence in our offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on third party cloud infrastructure services to deliver our offerings to users, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently host our sports betting and online gaming offerings and support our operations using a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not, and will not, have control over the operations of the facilities or infrastructure of the third-party service provider that we use. Such third party\u2019s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our technology\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance will be critical to our success. We have experienced, and we expect that in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from these third-party service providers from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in these third parties\u2019 service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of our users. Since our technology\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our technology, lead to a significant loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on strategic relationships with casinos, tribes and horse-tracks in order to be able to offer our sports betting, and online gaming products in certain jurisdictions. If we cannot establish and manage such relationships with such partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the sports betting and online gaming laws of certain states, sports betting and online gaming are limited to a finite number of retail operators, such as casinos, tribes or tracks, who own a \u201cskin\u201d or \u201cskins\u201d under that state\u2019s law. A \u201cskin\u201d is a legally-authorized license from a state to offer sports betting or online gaming services provided by such a retail operator. The \u201cskin\u201d provides a market access opportunity for mobile operators to operate in the jurisdiction pending licensure and other required approvals by the state\u2019s regulator. The entities that control those \u201cskins,\u201d and the numbers of \u201cskins\u201d available, are typically determined by a state\u2019s law authorizing sports betting or online gaming. In some of the jurisdictions in which we offer sports betting and online gaming, we currently rely on a casino, tribe or track in order to get a \u201cskin.\u201d These \u201cskins\u201d are what allows us to gain access to jurisdictions where online operators are required to have a retail relationship. If we cannot establish,\nrenew or manage our relationships, our relationships could terminate and we would not be allowed to operate in those jurisdictions until we enter into new ones. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on other third-party sports data providers for real-time and accurate data for sporting events, and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party sports data providers to obtain accurate information regarding schedules, results, performance and outcomes of sporting events. We rely on this data to determine when and how sports bets are settled. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, errors in this data feed which may result in us incorrectly settling bets. If we cannot adequately resolve the issue with our users, our users may have a negative experience with our offerings, our brand or reputation may be negatively affected and our users may be less inclined to continue or resume utilizing our products or recommend our offerings to other potential users. As such, a failure or significant interruption in our service may harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nFurthermore, if any of our sports data partners terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in an acceptable time frame. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners, including any publicity related to regulatory concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nOur growth will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. Overreliance on certain third parties, or our inability to extend existing relationships or agree to new relationships may cause unanticipated costs for us and impact our financial performance in the future.\nWe rely on relationships with sports leagues and teams, professional athletes and athlete organizations, advertisers, casinos and other third parties, including those affiliated with Barstool Sports, in order to attract users to our offerings. These relationships along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses direct consumers to our offerings. In addition, many of the parties with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including other gaming products with whom we compete. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our offerings, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fails to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, this could impact our ability to attract consumers cost effectively and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of employee information, customer information or other breaches of information security, particularly as our Interactive segment grows.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology and other systems (particularly as our Interactive segment grows), including our own systems and those of service providers and third parties, to manage our business and employee data and maintain and transmit customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists, and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and we have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply by implementing processes designed to safeguard the confidential and personal information of our business, employees and customers. In addition, our security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly. However, our information and processes and those of our service providers and other third parties, are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate the risks of breaches may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, disclosures, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability. Increased instances of cyber-attacks may also have a negative reputational impact on us and our properties that may result in a loss of customer confidence and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAs our sports betting and online gaming business grows, we will face increased cyber risks and threats that seek to damage, exploit, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, and supporting infrastructure. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risk could result in interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, and cause our users to lose confidence in our products. The unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure of consumer information could compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and substantial legal and financial liability. This could harm our business and reputation, disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position.\nOur growth prospects may suffer if we are unable to develop successful offerings or if we fail to pursue additional offerings. In addition, if we fail to make the right investment decisions in our offerings and technology, we may not attract and retain key users and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to rapid and frequent changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in customer demands and expectations and regulations. We must continuously make decisions regarding in which offerings and technology we should invest to meet customer demand in compliance with evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements and must continually introduce and successfully market new and innovative technologies, offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand, acceptance and engagement. Our ability to engage, retain, and increase our user base and to increase our revenue will depend heavily on our ability to successfully create new offerings, both independently and together with third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing technology and offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven products and services, with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. The process of developing new offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain, and new offerings may not be well received by users, even if well-reviewed and of high quality. If we are unable to develop technology and products that address users\u2019 needs or enhance and improve our existing technology and offerings in a timely manner, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough we intend to continue investing in our research and development efforts, if new or enhanced offerings fail to engage our users or partners, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, any of which may seriously harm our business. In addition, management may not properly ascertain or assess the risks of new initiatives, and subsequent events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time we decided to execute any new initiative. Creating additional offerings can also divert our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. Even if our new offerings attain market acceptance, those new offerings could exploit the market share of our existing product offerings or share of our users\u2019 wallets in a manner that could negatively impact their ecosystem. Furthermore, such expansion of our business increases the complexity of our business and places an additional burden on our management, operations, technical systems and financial resources and we may not recover the often-substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing new offerings, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other offerings. In the event of continued growth of our operations, products or in the number of third-party relationships, we may not have adequate resources, operationally, technologically or otherwise to support such growth and the quality of our technology, offerings or our relationships with third parties could suffer. In addition, failure to effectively identify, pursue and execute new business initiatives, or to efficiently adapt our processes and infrastructure to meet the needs of our innovations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny new offerings may also require our users to utilize new skills to use our offerings. This could create a lag in adoption of new offerings and new user additions related to any new offerings. To date, new offerings and enhancements of our existing technology have not hindered our user growth or engagement, but that may be the result of a large portion of our user base being in a younger demographic and more willing to invest the time to learn to use our products most effectively. To the extent that future users, including those in older demographics, are less willing to invest the time to learn to use our products, and if we are unable to make our products easier to learn to use, our user growth or engagement could be affected, and our business could be harmed. We may develop new products that increase user engagement and costs without increasing revenue.\nAdditionally, we may make bad or unprofitable decisions regarding these investments. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings, we may lose users or users may decrease their spending on our offerings. New customer demands, superior competitive offerings, new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our existing offerings unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology or business model. Our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or evolving customer demands could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe growth of our Interactive segment will depend on our ability to attract and retain users.\nOur ability to achieve growth in revenue in the future in our Interactive segment and its Barstool Sports sports betting and online gaming apps will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new users to our offerings, retain existing users of our offerings and reactivate users in a cost-effective manner. Achieving growth in our community of users may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales and marketing and promotional efforts, which may not make sense in terms of return on investment. We have used and expect to continue to use a variety of free and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and exciting games to achieve our objectives. For paid marketing, we intend to leverage a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media influencers (brand ambassadors), social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat, affiliates and paid and organic search, and other digital channels, such as mobile display. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms, change their terms around gaming, or if the prices at which we may purchase listings increase, then our costs could increase, and fewer users may click through to our website. If links to our website are not displayed prominently in online search results, if fewer users click through to our website, if our other digital marketing campaigns are not effective, if the costs of attracting users using any of our current methods significantly increase, then our ability to efficiently attract new users could be reduced, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn addition, our ability to increase the number of users of our offerings will depend on continued user adoption of the Barstool Sportsbook app and online gaming. Growth in the sportsbook and online gaming industries and the level of demand for and market acceptance of our product offerings will be subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We cannot assure that consumer adoption of our product offerings will continue or exceed current growth rates, or that the industry will achieve more widespread acceptance.\nAdditionally, as technological or regulatory standards change and we modify our platform to comply with those standards, we may need users to take certain actions to continue playing, such as performing age verification checks or accepting new terms and conditions. Users may stop using our product offerings at any time, including if the quality of the user experience on our platform, including our support capabilities in the event of a problem, does not meet their expectations or keep pace with the quality of the customer experience generally offered by competitive offerings.\nParticipation in the sports betting industry exposes us to trading, liability management and pricing risk. We may experience lower than expected profitability and potentially significant losses as a result of a failure to determine accurately the odds in relation to any particular event and/or any failure of its sports risk management processes.\nOur fixed-odds betting products involve betting where winnings are paid on the basis of the stake placed and the odds quoted. Odds are determined with the objective of providing an average return to the bookmaker over a large number of events and therefore, over the long term, our gross win percentage has remained fairly constant. However, there can be significant variation in gross win percentage event-by-event and day-by-day. We have systems and controls that seek to reduce the risk of daily losses occurring on a gross-win basis, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective in reducing our exposure, and consequently our exposure to this risk in the future. As a result, in the short term, there is less certainty of generating a positive gross win, and we may experience (and we have from time to time experienced) significant losses with respect to individual events or betting outcomes, in particular if large individual bets are placed on an event or betting outcome or series of events or betting outcomes. Odds compilers and risk managers are capable of human error, thus even allowing for the fact that a number of betting products are subject to capped pay-outs, significant volatility can occur. In addition, it is possible that there may be such a high volume of trading during any particular period that even automated systems would be unable to address and eradicate all risks. Any significant losses on a gross- win basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a jurisdiction where we hold or wish to apply for a license imposes a high turnover tax for betting (as opposed to a gross-win tax), this too would impact profitability, particularly with high value/low margin bets, and likewise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe follow the industry practice of restricting and managing betting limits at the individual customer level based on individual customer profiles and risk level to the enterprise; however there is no guarantee that states will allow operators such as us to place limits at the individual customer level.\nSimilar to a credit card company managing individual risk on the customer level through credit limits, it is customary for sports betting operators to manage customer-betting limits at the individual level to manage enterprise risk levels. We believe this practice is beneficial overall, because if it were not possible, the betting options would be restricted globally and limits available to customers would be much lower to insulate overall risk due to the existence of a very small segment of highly sophisticated syndicates and algorithmic bettors, or bettors looking to take advantage of site errors and omissions. We believe the majority of operators balance taking reasonable action from all customers against the risk of individual customers\nsignificantly harming the business viability. We cannot assure you that all state legislation and regulators will always allow operators to execute limits at the individual customer level, or at their sole discretion.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \u201cmarker,\u201d and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution; however, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nThe success, including win or hold rates, of existing or future sports betting and online gaming products depends on a variety of factors and is not completely controlled by us.\nThe sports betting and online gaming industries are characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of sports bet or iCasino game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. Net win is impacted by variations in the hold percentage (the ratio of net win to total amount wagered), or actual outcome, in our iCasino and sports betting offerings. We use the hold percentage as an indicator of the performance of the iCasino game or sports bet against its expected outcome. Although each iCasino game or sports bet generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary for any given period. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) may also (depending on the game involved) be affected by the spread of limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a user\u2019s skill, experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of users, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time spent gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates on our iCasino and sports bets may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the user\u2019s winnings exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and satisfy user preferences in a timely manner. As we will operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing industry and legal standards, our products will be subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We will need to continually introduce new offerings and identify future product offerings that complement our existing technology, respond to our users\u2019 needs and improve and enhance our existing technology to maintain or increase our user engagement and growth of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industries in which we compete, or trends in new gaming products.\nWe face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming properties or launching new online gaming or sports betting channels, which may lead to increased costs and delays in anticipated revenues.\nNo assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded gaming properties or launch new online gaming or sports betting channels, the expected timetables for opening such properties or channels will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. In addition, as we seek to launch online gaming and sports betting apps in additional states, we will need to hire additional qualified employees, such as engineers, IT professionals and other compliance personnel. Given the significant competition in this area for qualified candidates, we may be unable to hire qualified candidates. Delays in opening new or upgraded properties could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such properties or channels and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had indebtedness of $2.8 billion, including $1.6 billion outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, we are required to make significant annual lease payments to our REIT Landlords pursuant to the Triple Net Leases, which we currently expect will be approximately $806.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nWe have indebtedness and significant fixed annual lease payments under the Triple Net Leases. Our indebtedness and additional fixed costs under our Lease obligations could have important consequences to our financial health.\nThe lack of availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to finance some of our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and equity or debt financings. If we are unable to finance our current or future projects, we could have to seek alternative financing. Depending on credit market conditions, alternative sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development and/or renovation, or such other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility is $700.0 million, of which $674.0 million is available as of December 31, 2021. Our Revolving Credit Facility expires in 2023. There is no certainty that our lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness. We also may incur indebtedness related to properties we develop or acquire in the future prior to generating cash flow from those properties. If those properties do not provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness (including as a result of COVID-19), we will need to rely on cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage. In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business (particularly in the case of class actions). As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in these lawsuits, and, especially with increasing class action claims in our industry, litigation could result in costs, settlements, or damages that could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs owners and managers of retail casino gaming, online gaming, sports betting, video lottery, VGTs, and pari-mutuel wagering operations, we are subject to extensive state and local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in us. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, for instance, hours of operation, location or relocation of a\nfacility, and numbers and types of slot machines and table games. Gaming regulators may not have extensive experience in the digital media industry, which may present unique challenges in regulating our business. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against us, our subsidiaries, or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations and/or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nIn particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to retail casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them and/or courts in which parties challenge the interpretation or enforcement of them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation or regulation to prohibit, limit, or add burdens to increase taxes on our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nCertain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities.\nWe have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming and pari-mutuel properties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and renew those existing licenses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful. Furthermore, this risk is particularly pertinent to our online gaming and sports betting initiatives because regulations in this area are not as fully developed or established.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any record holder or beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a license or similar finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record holder or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable or fails to apply when required to do so, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.\nOur directors, officers, key employees, and joint venture partners must also meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities. If state gaming regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner or one of our vendors unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner or vendor. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees, joint venture partners or vendors to ensure compliance with applicable standards.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations, and if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally. The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer processes. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout\nthe gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests. Further, since we deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations, we are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of our properties, employees, partners, affiliates, or customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe riverboats on which we operate must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel, and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. The casino barges on which we operate also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of the gaming facilities on which we operate were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, construction, land use, employment, marketing, and advertising and the production, sale and service of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations or we are subject to a substantial penalty, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nState and local smoking restrictions have and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nLegislation in various forms to ban or substantially curtail indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking restrictions have significantly impacted business volumes. If additional smoking restrictions are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do business, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nChanges to consumer privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively and may require us to change our business practices or expend significant amounts on compliance with such laws.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing, online advertising, and postal mailings. Any further restrictions in laws such as the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, applicable Federal Communications Commission telemarketing rules (including the declaratory ruling affirming the blocking of unwanted robocalls), the FTC Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law and various U.S. state laws, or new federal or state laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy, e-privacy, and anti-spam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, online advertising, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products.\nFurther, certain of our products and services depend on the ability to use non-public personal, financial transaction, and or other information relating to patrons, which we may collect and or obtain from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships. To the extent that we collect, control, or process such information, federal, state, and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation the California Consumer Privacy Act, the General Data Protection Regulation and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, require us to make disclosures regarding our privacy and information sharing practices, safeguard and protect the privacy of such information, and, in some cases, provide patrons the opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of the use of their information for certain purposes, any of which could limit our ability to leverage existing and future databases of information which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe must comply with federal, state, and foreign requirements regarding notice and consent to obtain, use, share, transmit and store such information. Furthermore, we may face conflicting obligations arising from the potential concurrent application of laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event that we are not able to reconcile such obligations, we may be required to change business practices or face liability or sanction.\nTo the extent that we fail to comply with applicable consumer protection and data privacy laws, we may become subject to actions by individuals or regulatory authorities, which may result in the payment of fines or the imposition of other monetary or non-monetary penalties.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities which could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. From time to time, we have incurred and are incurring costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitively. To date, none of these matters have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of other hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. Under our contractual arrangements under the Triple Net Leases, we will generally be responsible for both past and future environmental liabilities associated with our gaming operations, notwithstanding ownership of the underlying real property having been transferred. Furthermore, we are aware that there is or may have been soil or groundwater or other contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former operations. These environmental conditions may require remediation in isolated areas. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitely, and may result in additional expense in the event that additional or currently unknown conditions are detected.\nIn the event we make another acquisition, we may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete, or other delays or impediments to completing, such acquisition.\nOur growth is fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming, racing, and development properties, as well as our online gaming and sports betting initiatives. In addition to standard closing conditions, our acquisitions are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such acquisitions and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMaterial increases to our taxes or the adoption of new taxes or the authorization of new or increased forms of gaming could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nWe believe that the prospect of generating incremental revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit or expand legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time-to-time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes, property taxes and/or by authorizing additional gaming properties each subject to payment of a new license fee. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in such laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If various state and local governments face economic challenges, it becomes more likely that those governments could seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming legislation or new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes. Deteriorating economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any new or increased gaming or the material increase or adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, especially in light of our significant fixed rent payments.", "PERMNO": 80563, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "PENN"}
