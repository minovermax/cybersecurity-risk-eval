The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Corporation are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\u2019s Business\nEconomic conditions have affected and could adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that the Corporation offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates and in the U.S. as a whole. An economic downturn or sustained, high unemployment levels, and stock market volatility may negatively impact our operating results and have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans (thereby, increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses), the value of collateral securing those loans, and demand for loans and other products and services that the Corporation offers.\nGeographic concentration of the Corporation\u2019s markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions and a downturn in local economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nUnlike larger banking organizations that are more geographically diversified, the Corporation\u2019s operations are currently concentrated in west central Indiana and east central Illinois (operations are anticipated to expand into western Kentucky and middle and western Tennessee assuming completion of the acquisition of HopFed Bancorp, Inc., as discussed below). The economic conditions in these local markets may be different from, and in some instances be worse than, the economic conditions in the U.S. as a whole. As a result of this geographic concentration, the Corporation\u2019s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in the Corporation\u2019s markets could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services; and\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors include banks and many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies, financial technology companies, and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand the Corporation's market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with the Corporation's level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation's competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation's growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep pace, our business may suffer.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Further, many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s growth, revenue, and profit.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many customers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s operations, and the Corporation may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries are community banks and their reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we\nserve, delivering superior service to our customers, and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe Corporation is dependent on certain key management and staff\nThe Corporation relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business. The loss of key staff may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in the Corporation's net income.\nOur operational systems and networks are subject to an increasing risk of continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in a loss of customer business, financial liability, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation, or the disclosure of confidential information.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing, and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers\u2019 transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyberattacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers\u2019 accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name, which could negatively affect our reputation or result in litigation and, consequently, negatively affect our results of operation.\nThe occurrence of cybersecurity incidents across a range of industries has resulted in increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny over cybersecurity and calls for additional data privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations could result in increased operating expenses or increase our exposure to the risk of litigation.\nThe occurrence of a cybersecurity incident involving us, third party service provides, or our customers, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Furthermore, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the Corporation\u2019s net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, domestic and international events, changes in U.S. and other financial markets, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest that is received on loans and securities and the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s financial assets and liabilities.\nAs compared to historical rates, interest rates remain at low levels. For several years prior to December 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve kept the target federal funds rate between 0% to 0.25% to help the overall U.S. economy. In December 2015, the FOMC increased the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points, representing the first increase in nearly a decade. Over the past three years, the FOMC has slowly increased the target federal funds rate. The extent to which the FOMC will continue raising interest rates in 2019 is unclear. In January 2019, the FOMC indicated the adoption of a more cautious approach to rate increases, which will likely be influenced by global economic and financial developments and inflationary pressures throughout 2019.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. Such an interest rate environment may also result in us incurring a higher cost to retain our deposits. While the higher payment amounts we would receive on adjustable-rate or variable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment may increase our interest income, some borrowers may be unable to afford the higher payment amounts, and this could result in a higher rate of default. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities. Accordingly, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s actual loan losses exceed our allowance for loan losses, our net income will decrease.\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses (but see discussion below regarding change to a new accounting standard) that are inherent within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of the Corporation\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nThe Corporation requires liquidity to meet our deposit and other obligations as they come due. The Corporation\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or the general economy. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against the Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of depositors. The Corporation may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future, especially if a large number of depositors sought to withdraw their deposits, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nThe Corporation has significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and commercial real estate loans.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 60% of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and commercial real estate loans. These loans are generally viewed as having more inherent risk of default than residential mortgage or consumer loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business. These loans are more likely to be adversely affected by weak conditions in the economy. Also, the commercial loan balance per borrower is typically larger than that of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, indicating higher potential losses on an individual loan basis. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and a reduction in interest income. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the regulatory framework to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Corporation, the Bank, and the Morris Plan operate in a highly regulated environment and we are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC and DFI, respectively. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not our shareholders. These regulations affect the Corporation\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, regulatory structure, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nSince the 2007-2008 financial crisis, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. Financial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. These changes and increased scrutiny may result in increased costs of doing business, decreased revenues and net income, may reduce our ability to effectively compete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations of such laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above, impact the regulatory structure under which we operate, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Basel III capital rules may require us to retain higher capital levels, impacting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our stock, or pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework which became effective on January 1, 2015. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules formerly applicable to the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries. The rules have been phased in over time beginning in 2015 and became fully phased in 2019. The rules provide for minimum capital ratios of (i) common equity Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of 4.5%, (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and (iii) total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. As fully phased in, the rules also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% on top of the foregoing minimum capital ratios, resulting in an effective requirement for minimum capital ratios of (a) common equity Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of 7%, (b) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (c) total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe Corporation\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models, which, if inadequate, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nThe processes the Corporation uses to estimate its loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models the Corporation uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Corporation may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Corporation uses for determining its probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models the Corporation uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Corporation could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Corporation\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and the Corporation\u2019s methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal operations are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud, and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Additionally, instruments, systems, and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational, and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the\nCorporation may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.\nWe rely on external vendors, which could expose the Corporation to additional operational risks.\nThe Corporation relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may foreclose on collateral property and would be subject to the increased costs associated with ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings\nThe Corporation forecloses on collateral property from time to time to protect its investment and thereafter owns and operates such property, in which case it is exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that the Corporation, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of its control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations, and fiscal policies; and (x) natural disasters. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property, and the Corporation may have to advance funds in order to protect its investment, or it may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. These expenditures and costs could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings may be adversely impacted due to environmental liabilities associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Corporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Corporation\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUncertainty about the future of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and its accepted alternatives, may adversely affect our business.\nThe Corporation and its subsidiaries have certain financial arrangement and instruments which have an interest rate indexed to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve to identity alternative reference interest rates, announced a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad Treasuries overnight repurchase agreement (repo) financing rate, as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR, along with other alternative reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to these alternative reference rates as transition is anticipated to be gradual over the coming years.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted market alternatives to LIBOR. It is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based financial arrangement and instruments, including securities,\nvariable rate loans, and debt instruments, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and the effect of any changes or reforms to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR on new or existing financial arrangement or instruments to which we have exposure may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based financial arrangement and instruments, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers or our existing borrowings, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFDIC insurance premiums we pay may change and be significantly higher in the future. Market developments may significantly deplete the insurance fund of the FDIC and further reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits, thereby making it requisite upon the FDIC to charge higher premiums prospectively.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value.\nThe Corporation generally seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of associated with identifying and evaluating potential new markets, hiring experienced local management, and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to a target company;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nclosing delays and expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of targets;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we lack experience;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022\nthe risk of loss of key employees and customers; and\n\u2022\nincurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Corporation\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the Bank is unable to integrate Heritage Bank USA, Inc. (\u201cHeritage\u201d) successfully, our business and earnings may be negatively affected.\nOn January 7, 2019, the Corporation announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire, by merger, HopFed Bancorp, Inc. and its banking subsidiary, Heritage (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The success of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the Bank\u2019s ability to successfully integrate Heritage\u2019s operations with the Bank. The Bank\u2019s post-Merger operations may not be able to be integrated with Heritage without encountering difficulties including, without limitation, the loss of key employees and customers, the disruption of the ongoing business of the Bank or Heritage, or possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies. If the Bank has difficulties with the integration, it might not fully achieve the economic benefits it expects to result from the Merger. In addition, the Bank may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of the business of Heritage, and/or may not realize expected cost savings from the Merger within the expected time frame. If integration is unsuccessful or does not occur in the manner anticipated by management it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Corporation to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Corporation may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services the Corporation may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Corporation\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture growth or operating results may require the Corporation to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or it may be dilutive.\nThe Corporation is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. To the extent the Corporation\u2019s future operating results erode capital or the Corporation elects to expand through loan growth or acquisition it may be required to raise capital. The Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of its control, and on the Corporation\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, the Corporation may not be able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, it will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on its growth and business. These restrictions could negatively impact the Corporation\u2019s ability to operate or further expand its operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Corporation, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Corporation\u2019s day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Corporation\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to the Corporation by its vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Corporation may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. If the Corporation is found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. In certain cases, the Corporation may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property. These licenses may also significantly increase the Corporation\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Corporation or settled, the Corporation could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe value of the Corporation\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $36 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in the Corporation\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the Corporation\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Corporation were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Corporation would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial\nservices industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Corporation cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Corporation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue\nThe Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Corporation\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Corporation\u2019s debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and the Morris Plan may pay to the Corporation. Also, the Corporation\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank and/or the Morris Plan are unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on the Corporation\u2019s common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank and/or the Morris Plan could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Corporation may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice\nThe Corporation has historically paid a semi-annual dividend to common stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on the Corporation\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock and may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. The Corporation\u2019s common stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements and news reports relating to the Corporation\u2019s business and trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the Corporation\u2019s results of operations;\n\u2022\nsales or purchases of substantial amounts of the Corporation\u2019s securities in the marketplace;\n\u2022\na shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\nactual or expected economic conditions that are perceived to affect the Corporation, such as changes in real estate values or interest rates;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the Corporation and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable government regulation; and\n\u2022\nthe Corporation\u2019s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nAs such, the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the stock, and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of the Corporation\u2019s common stock when making an investment decision.\nFuture capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment.\nOur board of directors may determine from time to time there is a need to or, if our or the Bank\u2019s or the Morris Plan\u2019s regulatory capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of stock or other securities, including debt securities and senior or subordinated notes. We are currently authorized to issue up to 40 million shares of common stock, of which 12.3 million shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are outstanding. Subject to certain limitations, our board of directors generally has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the remaining authorized but unissued shares and to establish the rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of preferred stock. These equity and/or debt issuances\ncould dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to our shareholders which may adversely impact our shareholders.\nAnti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Corporation. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Corporation\u2019s common stock. There also are Indiana statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in the Corporation being less attractive to a potential acquiror.\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Corporation\u2019s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 77379, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "THFF"}
