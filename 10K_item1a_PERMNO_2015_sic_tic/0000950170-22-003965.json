Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Report, including in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statement and notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. The risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this Report may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nSummary of Principal Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk set forth below:\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022We have experienced some decreases in sales of our products in various distribution channels that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as health and fitness clubs. While some of the restrictions imposed as a result of the initial COVID-19 outbreak have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized, resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in some markets has slowed or reversed the reopening process, and markets are moving through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times. However, we have recently seen a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Hemisphere while cases in the Southern Hemisphere continue to rise. As a result, a number of countries, particularly in EMEA, have reinstituted lockdowns and other restrictions, which could further impact customer demand. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches, could be prolonged and may become more severe.\n\u2022Deteriorating economic conditions and continued financial uncertainties in many of our major markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased and prolonged unemployment, decreases in per capita income and the level of disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers\u2019 ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, public concern among consumers regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 may also reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022The closures of, and continued restrictions on, on-premise retailers and other establishments that sell our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our sales and results of operations.\n\u2022Our advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement activities have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by reduced opportunities for such activities due to measures taken to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellations of or reduced capacity at sporting events, concerts and other events may result in decreased demand for our products. Our product sampling programs, which are part of our strategy to develop brand awareness, have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the changing landscape of advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales, market share, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\u2022Our innovation activities, including our ability to introduce new products in certain markets, have been delayed and/or adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If such innovation activities are disrupted and we continue to delay the launch of new products and/or we are unable to secure sufficient distribution levels for such new products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Some of our suppliers, bottlers/distributors and co-packers may experience plant closures, production slowdowns and disruptions in operations as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could result in a disruption to our operations.\n\u2022We may experience delays in receiving certain raw materials as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed by port authorities, closures of, or congestion at ports, reduced availability of commercial transportation, border restrictions and capacity constraints.\n\u2022Due to increased demand in at-home consumption, the functional energy drink and liquid supplement industries have experienced some shortages of aluminum cans. However, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects on our business, operations and financial condition from such shortage, however we are unable to accurately predict how this might change.\n\u2022As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental measures, restrictions, directives and guidance, many of our office-based employees have worked remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our remote work policy remains in place. If our employees working remotely do not maintain appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and operations from information technology-related disruptions, we may face cybersecurity threats. Employees of our third-party service providers who are working remotely, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar cybersecurity risks.\n\u2022Governmental authorities at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and in certain foreign jurisdictions may increase or impose new income taxes, indirect taxes or other taxes or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations as a means of financing the costs of stimulus or may take other measures to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in direct and indirect tax rates could affect our net income and increases in consumer taxes could affect our products\u2019 affordability and reduce our sales.\n\u2022We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to goodwill or intangible assets whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The continued financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause one or more of the financial institutions we do business with to fail or default in their obligations to us or to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, which could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in negative publicity and the Company becoming a party to litigation claims and/or legal proceedings, which could consume significant financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injury to our reputation.\n\u2022The resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s lingering effects on our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers, contractors, business partners and/or other service providers.\nAny of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition.\nConsolidation of retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the industry may result in downward pressure on sales prices.\nConsolidation can cause significant downward pricing pressure and can impose additional costs on us. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential impact of these commercial changes, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nWe do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer.\nWe distribute CELSIUS\u00ae in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If CELSIUS\u00ae proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.\nUnilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.\nIncreases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business.\nThe principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us.\nWhile the functional energy drink and supplement industries have experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply, though potentially at higher cost. To address the industry-wide shortage of aluminum cans, we have imported cans manufactured abroad which affected our margins in 2021 and will continue to affect our margins in 2022. We believe the increased prices, combined with a requirement to prepay for raw materials, will negatively impact our margins. We are unable to accurately predict how these cost trends might evolve prospectively. Such industry-wide shortages of raw materials, including aluminum cans, could from time to time in the future be encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients, flavors, sleek aluminum cans and other raw materials for our supplements or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain ingredients have occurred and could occur, from time to time in the future, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in and blurring of the lines between retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.\nVarious jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our supplement products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.\nOur continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets.\nWe have continued expanding our sales of our products internationally into a variety of new markets and are currently seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in East Asia and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. As our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. Although we intend to sell through established distributors in international markets, we have limited or no operating experience in many of such markets and it may be costly to promote our brands in international markets. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with foreign distribution and sale of our products, including: economic and/or political instability in various international markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to distribute and sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, distribution and sale of products outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potentially higher product damage rates if our products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.\nNumerous U.S. and International laws including export and import controls affect our ability to compete in international markets.\nU.S. export control laws and economic and trade sanctions prohibit the provision of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being shipped or provided to embargoed countries and U.S. sanctions targets, they could be shipped, or provided by our distributors, to those countries and targets despite such precautions. The provision of goods in violation of U.S. export controls and/or sanctions could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. We must also comply with U.S. import laws.\nU.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) also impact our international activities. We are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments and offers to foreign officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Selling products into international markets, including through distributors, creates the risk of unauthorized payments or offers, for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in export and import regulations, economic sanctions and related laws, shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the countries, governments or persons targeted by such regulations and the imposition of tariffs may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, result in decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations or in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons.\nActions taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, the products subject to such actions, and actions taken by other countries in retaliation may also have an adverse impact on us. The failure to comply with applicable current or future U.S. import, export control, sanctions\nand anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Customs regulations, could expose us and our employees to substantial civil or criminal penalties, fines and in extreme cases, incarceration. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, or otherwise act in accordance with applicable laws, we may be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.\nGlobal or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business.\nBecause of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in Florida, a state at greater risk of hurricanes. Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers\u2019 ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nClimate change and natural disasters may affect our business.\nThere is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our products.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers\u2019 ability to purchase our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and water scarcity, as well as initiatives by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws, regulations, standards or practices, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Our third-party co-packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our liquid supplement products and powder packets that are derived from agricultural commodities. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our supplements, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively.\nWe depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.\nOur products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors.\nWe believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information.\nWe must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.\nInformation technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data.\nWe rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, co-packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise.\nWe believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure.\nMoreover, if our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable individuals (\u201cpersonal data\u201d), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California residents, including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.\nChanges introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. There can be no assurances that our security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth, and anticipate such growth may continue. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we grew from 154 to 225 employees, and expect to continue expanding our hiring and marketing efforts with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. This growth may place significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must manage such growth effectively by successfully integrating, developing and motivating a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our products and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our planned growth, or even if we are able to grow as planned, that we will continue to sustain such growth or performance.\nWe may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability.\nWe may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate.\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, experience, relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals also depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn particular, our continued success will depend in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees finalize their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business may be adversely affected, and our management team may be distracted. Furthermore, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any of\nour key employees who leave or be able to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our procurement and distribution processes, sales and marketing activities, financial processes & condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products.\nAlthough six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA.\nFurther, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) regulates advertising and may review the truthfulness of and substantiation for any claim we make related to our products.\nOur advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and nutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe shifting regulatory environment through the various jurisdictions in which are products are sold necessitates building and maintaining robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry\nWe are subject to significant competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries.\nThe functional energy drink and supplement industries are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do.\nImportant factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestl\u00e9, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Monster Energy and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. New competitors continue to emerge, some of which target specific markets of ours as well as the health and wellness space. This may require additional marketing expenditures on our part to remain competitive.\nThe rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, particularly during, and potentially following, the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. We have been growing our e-commerce sales by using Amazon and leveraging our retail partners e-commerce platforms, rather than building our own internal platform. However, if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\nDue to competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting-edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive functional energy drink and supplement industries and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nChanges in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.\nThe functional energy drink and supplement categories are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened drinks and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Our products do not contain the artificial preservatives often found in many\nenergy drinks and sodas. CELSIUS\u00ae has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. The main CELSIUS\u00ae line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda\u00ae, which makes our liquid supplements low-calorie. However, consumer preferences may shift away from the trend towards healthier options that we have observed, and as such, there can be no assurance that our current products and product lines will maintain their current levels of demand. There are also changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations. This may reduce demand for our functional energy drinks and liquid supplements, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.\nConsumers are seeking greater variety in their functional energy drinks and supplements. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative drinks and supplements that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative supplements and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some functional energy drink and supplement brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers\u2019 preferences change. The functional energy drink and supplements we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such products will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our consumers on their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive virtually all of our revenues from functional energy drinks and supplements, and competitive pressure in the functional energy drink and supplement category could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur focus is in the functional energy drink and supplement categories, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the fitness supplement category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nVirtually all of our sales are derived from our functional energy drink and supplements, including our CELSIUS\u00ae Originals, CELSIUS HEAT, CELSIUS BCCA+ENERGY, CELSIUS\u00ae On-the-Go and CELSIUS\u00ae product lines. Any decrease in the sales of our functional energy drinks and supplements could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the functional energy drink and supplement categories.\nThe increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space, including in coolers, in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the functional energy drink and supplement categories could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors\u2019 existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that CELSIUS\u00ae will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the CELSIUS\u00ae brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the global functional energy drink and supplement sectors, we expect and intend to continue to introduce new products and evolve existing products to better match consumer demand. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development and consumer acceptance. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, exposure to additional regulations and reliance on the performance of third parties.\nOur sales are affected by seasonality.\nAs is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our products and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.\nThe production, marketing and sale of our functional energy drinks and supplements are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes\nin these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct safety and quality concerns, or other negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation and may cause our business to suffer.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our suppliers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our suppliers may not always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into product categories that are beyond our traditional range of functional energy drinks and supplements. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our supplement products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.\nOur success also depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality, human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our workforce, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees, distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. For example, Celsius\u2019 former managing director of Asia, since leaving the Company, has been charged in connection with 1Malaysia Development Bhd.-related matters. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. For example, we are currently in arbitration proceedings with McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern about a fee dispute emerging from a representative agreement among the parties and Celsius Holdings in connection with sales of our products in the People\u2019s Republic of China for four years starting from September 1, 2017. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer demand for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation.\nIn addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting the human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like could negatively affect our Company\u2019s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products\u2019 acceptance by consumers.\nLitigation regarding our products could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products.\nWe have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims and others. Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law. Putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against us, alleging that certain claims in our marketing promotional amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, and we have been defending, and will continue to vigorously defend such lawsuits.\nAny of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in diminished operational efficiency of the Company, significant monetary awards against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Status as a Reporting Public Company\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on\nan annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.\nOur periodic filings as required under the Exchange Act may be subject to review and comment by the SEC, which may result in changes to our public disclosure.\nOur periodic filings with the SEC in compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, may be subject to review and comment by the SEC. Should the SEC conduct such review and comment, we may be required to revise such periodic filings, including but not limited to the financial statements contained therein.\nIf we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price\nWe are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements.\nAs described in Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, management has identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company is in the process of developing and implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. If the Company\u2019s remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and it could be required to revise or restate its financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe face investigation from the SEC, the timeline for which and the results of which are currently unknown.\nOn January 8, 2021, we received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. On August 20, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena for production of documents in connection with the matter. Neither the January 8, 2021 SEC letter nor the August 20, 2021 subpoena means that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations.\nWe may also be subject to further or other examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by the SEC or other regulators. Any such further or other actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.\nMarket prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022the issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a public or private offering;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022change in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022investor perceptions of CELSIUS\u00ae and the functional energy drink and supplement industries generally; and\n\u2022general economic and other national conditions.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders can exert significant influence on the Company\u2019s corporate affairs.\nOur principal stockholder owns approximately 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93263, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "CELH"}
