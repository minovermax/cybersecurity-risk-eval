RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future. Capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nWe intend to continue to make investments in pursuit of our strategic objectives and to support our business growth. Various business challenges may require additional funds, including the need to respond to competitive threats or market evolution by developing new solutions and improving our operating infrastructure, either through additional hiring or acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies, or both. In addition, we may incur significant expenses or shortfalls in anticipated cash generated as a result of unanticipated events in our business or competitive, regulatory, or other changes in our market, or longer payment cycles required or imposed by our customers.\nOur available cash and cash equivalents, and any cash we may generate from operations, may not be adequate to meet our capital needs, and therefore we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and respond to business challenges may be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer dilution, which may be significant, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future may involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, including the ability to pay dividends. This may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, if we issue debt, the holders of that debt would have prior claims on our assets, and in case of insolvency, the claims of creditors would be satisfied before distribution of value to equity holders, which would result in significant reduction or total loss of the value of our equity.\nWe have a history of operating losses.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a consolidated net loss of\u2009$17.0 million from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consolidated net losses for all prior periods that has resulted in our having an accumulated deficit of\u2009$172.8 million as of December 31, 2018. We have not achieved profitability on an annual basis. We may not be able to reach a level of revenue to achieve profitability. If our revenues grow slower than anticipated, or if operating expenses exceed expectations, then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress the price of our stock.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a disclosure describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital and/or enter into substantial contracts when needed or on attractive terms, it would be forced to reduce overhead and administrative expenditures and/or delay research and development projects. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely that the holders of our common stock will lose their investment in the Company.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWe announced the resignation of several Board members and our Chief Financial Officer during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. In addition, our Chief Revenue Officer resigned effective October 23, 2018. On January 14, 2019, Aaron Tam resigned as our Interim Co-Chief Financial Officer. Terry Lynn was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer, effective as of February 19, 2019. In connection with Mr. Lynn\u2019s appointment, William Seagrave, our Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, stepped down as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Seagrave currently serves as our Chief Operating Officer and Secretary.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively. The resignation of our senior management may interrupt operations, as we heavily depend on senior managers to perform key tasks and roles to maintain our operations. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization.\nA significant portion of our revenue is dependent upon a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers would negatively impact our revenues and our results of operations.\nOf our total revenue earned during the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 13% was generated from contracts with one advertising agency and 52% of our revenue was generated from the 12 largest customers. Termination of business relationships with SITO by these customers may materially and adversely affect our revenues and results from operations.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which make our future results difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not consider our past results, including our recent growth rates as indicative of our future performance.\nIn addition to other risk factors listed in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u25cf seasonal variations in advertising spending;\n\u25cf fluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u25cf the length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of investment in the development of new technologies, features and functionality of our platform;\n\u25cf changes in the availability or price of advertising inventory;\n\u25cf the timing and success of changes in our offerings or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing or pricing of our competitors\u2019 solutions;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation applicable to our industry; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nBased upon all the factors described above, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses, and as a result, our operating results may from time to time fall below our estimates.\nOur revenue and operating results are highly dependent on the overall demand for advertising. Factors that affect the amount of advertising spending, such as economic downturns, can make it difficult to predict our revenue and may adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of our current and prospective sellers and customers. If advertisers reduce their overall advertising spending, our revenue and results of operations are directly affected. Various macroeconomic factors may cause advertisers to reduce their advertising budgets, including adverse economic conditions and general uncertainty about economic recovery or growth, where we do most of our business, instability in political or market conditions generally, and any changes in favorable tax treatment of advertising expenses and the deductibility thereof. Reductions in inventory due to loss of sellers would make our products less robust and attractive to customers.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts. The length of our sales cycles varies depending on the type of customer and program. A short sales cycle will address a campaign already defined by the customer. A long sales cycle is required when we assist the customer in the design of a campaign, or analysis of data, or a larger program design. These cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue figures are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, according to the mix of short or long programs addressed, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to large organizations. The length of our sales cycle, from proof of concept to delivery of and payment for our products, is typically three to nine months but can be more than a year. If our competitors offer or develop products that our prospective customers may want to compare to our products, that situation may cause our average sales cycle to become longer.\nBecause the length of time required to close a sale varies substantially from customer to customer, it is difficult to accurately predict when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in periods subsequent to those periods in which we anticipated they would occur or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a period may impact our results of operations for that period and any future periods for which revenue from that transaction is delayed. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast accurately our revenue for any particular period in the future. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if our revenue falls below expectations in a particular period, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur revenues may not increase\nAn increase in our revenues will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire new customers or gain a larger portion of advertising expenditures from our existing customers, and opening new revenue streams with data, insight-driven analytic products and deliverables. We will continue to roll out our data and data-driven ad placement products, innovate and develop new technologies with additional features and functionality. Our goal is to increase our share of and compete successfully in the new growing mobile digital advertising and data-insight markets which we may fail to achieve.\nFurther, to accommodate growth in our revenues, if any, we must continually improve and maintain our current existing technology, systems and network infrastructure. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which would use our cash and negatively impact our gross margin or operating expenses in any particular quarter. A variety of factors outside of our control may impact whether our revenues increase, including changes in budgets of advertisers and the timing and size of their expenditures. Decisions by advertisers to delay or reduce advertising expenditures or divert expenditures away from mobile advertising may adversely impact our revenues and financial performance.\nActs of competitors and other third parties can adversely affect our business.\nWe do not control the spending or inventory on our platform, and our revenue is therefore vulnerable to acts by third parties that reduce the amounts of spending or inventory available to us. For example, the amount of inventory available to independent platforms like us may be reduced as a result of decisions by Facebook to emphasize content viewable through its site or to favor friends and family-type feeds over third-party properties, or decisions by Google to utilize its ad server advantages to outbid us and other competitors in open-market auctions. Similarly, decisions by customers and sellers to transact directly rather than through us would tend to reduce both spending and inventory on our platform.\nWe may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.\nWe need to grow significantly and expand our data and data-driven ad placement products, and the scope of our offering in order to keep pace with the growth and change in our market and to develop the market reach and scale necessary to compete effectively with large competitors. Our future growth, if any, depends to a significant degree upon the quality of our strategic vision and planning. The advertising market is evolving rapidly, and if we make strategic errors, there is a significant risk that we will lose our competitive position and be unable to recover and achieve our objectives. Our ability to grow requires access to, and prudent deployment of, capital for hiring, expansion of physical infrastructure to run our solution, acquisition of companies or technologies, and development and integration of supporting technical, sales, marketing, finance, administrative, and managerial infrastructure. Further, the rapid growth we are pursuing may itself strain the organization and our ability to generate that growth and to maintain the quality of our operations.\nWe must continue to refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. In order to grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf meet our capital needs;\n\u25cf implement, improve and expand our operational, financial, management information, risk management and other systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner;\n\u25cf allocate our human resources efficiently;\n\u25cf identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified managers and employees;\n\u25cf develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; or\n\u25cf develop a corporate culture that is conducive to success.\nIf we do not manage our business effectively, successfully forecast demand for our products or manage our anticipated expenses accordingly, our financial position and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf our customers do not maintain and increase their level of advertising expenditures through our platform, our revenue growth and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAdvertisers generally use multiple providers in managing their advertising expenditures. Accordingly, we must convince our customers to use our products, increase their usage and allocate a larger share of their advertising budgets with us, and do so on an ongoing basis. We may not be successful at educating and training customers, particularly our newer customers, about the benefits of our products, and if we fail to do so, they may not increase their use of our products or generate higher levels of advertising expenditures. If these efforts are unsuccessful or advertisers decide not to continue to maintain or increase their advertising expenditures through our platform for any reason, then we may not attract new advertisers, or our existing customers may reduce their advertising expenditures through or cease using our platform. Therefore, we cannot assure you that advertisers that have generated advertising expenditures through our platform in the past will continue to generate similar levels of advertising expenditures in the future or that they will continue to use our platform at all. We may not be able to replace customers who decrease or cease their usage of our platform with new customers that make similar expenditures on our platform. If our existing customers do not continue to use and increase their use of our platform, or if we are unable to attract sufficient advertising expenditures on our platform from new customers, our revenue may decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term agreements with our customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers, or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our current customer relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts and relationships with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers are typically short term in nature and generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our products, and these contracts are generally cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we currently have limited visibility into our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our products, or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue. If a major customer representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our products or to cease using our products altogether, our revenue may be significantly reduced. Any non-renewal, renegotiation, cancellation or deferral of large advertising contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of revenue, may cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and adversely affect our business.\nOur contracts with customers and sellers are generally not exclusive and generally do not require minimum volumes or long-term commitments. If customers or sellers representing a significant portion of the demand or inventory in our marketplace decide to materially reduce the use of our products, we may experience an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and profitability and harm to our business.\nGenerally, our customers and sellers are not obligated to provide us with any minimum volumes of business, they may do business with our competitors as well as with us, and they may bypass us and transact directly with each other or through other intermediaries. Most of our business with customers originates pursuant to arrangements that are limited in scope and can be reduced or canceled by the customer without penalty. Similarly, sellers make inventory available to us on a discretionary basis. Accordingly, our business is highly vulnerable to changes in the macro environment, price competition and the development of new or more compelling offerings by our competitors, which may adversely affect our revenues and financial performance or motivate customers or sellers to migrate to competitors\u2019 offerings. Further, if our relationships with customers or sellers become strained due to service failures or other reasons, including possible perceptions by our customers that we compete with them, these clients may reduce or terminate their business with us. Because we do not have long-term contracts, our future revenue may be difficult to predict, and there is no assurance that our current customers and sellers will continue to use our products or that we will be able to replace lost customers or sellers with new ones. If a customer or group of customers representing a significant portion of the demand in our marketplace, or a seller or group of sellers representing a significant portion of the inventory in our marketplace, decides to materially reduce use of our products, our revenues and business may be immediately and significantly adversely impacted. Additionally, if we overestimate future usage, we may incur additional expenses in adding infrastructure without a commensurate increase in revenue, which would harm our business and operating results.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address those weaknesses or if we have other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management undertook an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. These evaluations revealed certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address those weaknesses, or if we have other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, concluded that due to a material weakness related to an insufficient complement of finance and accounting resources within the organization to ensure the proper application of U.S. GAAP with respect to our complex non-routine transactions, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness was in part attributable to high turnover with respect to our Board, management, chief financial officer, accounting staff and independent outside auditors over the last few years, particularly in the first three quarters of 2017. Specifically, our management has determined that (1) our controls over complex nonroutine transactions were not designed to capture all non-routine activities and (2) our controls were not designed to ensure that complex non-routine transactions are adequately analyzed and accounted for in accordance with GAAP. During 2018, additional controls were instituted to address matters of internal controls and procedures identified in the evaluation.\nInternal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors, because any control system, regardless of its design, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved.\nWe cannot assure you that in the future additional material weaknesses will not occur, exist or otherwise be identified. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our processes, procedures and controls and will make changes as management determines appropriate. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, there may be a negative effect on our stock price, and we may be subject to civil or criminal investigations and penalties.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and other business practices, and of board-level oversight, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. Consequently, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and this may decrease the trading price of our stock.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. We are responsible for reviewing and assessing our internal controls and implementing additional controls when improvement is needed. Failure to implement any required changes to our internal controls or other changes we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls may adversely affect our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the market price of our stock, and may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requirements regarding internal control over financial reporting, and other internal controls over business practices, are costly to implement and maintain, and such costs are relatively more burdensome for smaller companies such as us than for larger companies. We have limited internal personnel to implement procedures and must scale our procedures to be compatible with our resources. We also rely on outside professionals, including accountants and attorneys, to support our control procedures. We are working to improve all of our controls but, if our controls are not effective, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties which may lead to a decrease in the market price of our stock. We are in the process of documenting all of our accounting processes and developing step-by-step guidance for each function in our accounting department to allow employees of the department to independently perform their functions.\nOur reorganization and cost-control efforts may not assure future profitability and may affect morale and make it difficult to retain employees or attract new ones.\nSince June 2017, we have endeavored to realign our business to best reflect the needs of our customers and the evolving marketplace in which we operate, and to pursue our strategic priorities and to optimize costs. The steps we have taken are intended to optimize our costs to align our organization and cost structure more appropriately to grow our data and data-driven ad placement, and our current revenue and scale and to position us better to expand our investments in future growth areas. However, our cost optimization efforts do not assure our profitability. Additional cost optimizations may be implemented in the future, and cost savings may be offset by future hiring or other costs to pursue strategic objectives. An optimization in force or further management reorganization may adversely affect morale in our organization and our reputation as an employer, which may lead to the loss of valued employees and may make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future, and the optimization of our headcount may adversely affect our service delivery and make it more difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives in the future.\nOur business strategy may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate, train, and retain highly qualified engineering, marketing, IT sales, management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends significantly upon our ability to recruit, train, motivate, and retain key technology, engineering, sales, management and other key personnel. We are a technology-driven company and it is imperative that we have highly skilled computer scientists, engineers, data scientists, data analysts, and management to innovate and deliver our platform. Increasing our base of customers and sellers depends to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations and activities, and our solution requires a sophisticated sales force with specific sales skills and specialized technical knowledge that takes time to develop. Appropriately qualified personnel can be difficult to recruit and retain. Skilled and experienced management is critical to our ability to achieve revenue growth, execute our strategic vision and maintain our performance through the growth and change we anticipate.\nCompetition for employees with experience in our industry can be intense, particularly in New Jersey and California, where our operations and the operations of other digital media companies are concentrated and where other technology companies compete for management and engineering talent. Other employers may be able to provide better compensation, more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement.\nIt can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to recruit personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. These challenges will increase if and to the extent that we grow. New hires require significant training and it may take significant time (often six months or more) before they achieve full productivity. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits and compensation expenses related to equity awards before new hires contribute to sales or productivity, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training such employees. Moreover, new employees may not be or become as productive as we expect, and we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. At times, we may experience elevated levels of unwanted attrition, and as our organization grows and changes and competition for talent increases, this type of attrition may increase.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors because competition in our industry is intense, and our competitors may offer products that are perceived by our customers to be more attractive than ours or leverage captive inventory or data to their advantage. These factors may negatively impact our revenue and result in the inability to grow our business.\nCompetition for our advertisers\u2019 advertising budgets is intense, as is competition for broader advertising solutions such as data management platforms. We operate in a market that is subject to rapid development and introduction of product and service offerings, changing branding objectives and evolving customer demands, all of which affect our ability to remain competitive. We expect competition to increase as the barriers to enter our market are low and consolidation is increasing. Increased competition may force us to charge less for our products or offer pricing models that are less attractive to us and, as a result, decrease our margins. Our principal competitors for our media buying solutions include traditional advertising networks and advertising agencies that operate an agency trading desk, either directly or through an affiliate. Competitors for our products include other companies that offer self-service DSP and/or DMP solutions, which allow advertisers to purchase inventory directly from advertising exchanges or other third parties and manage and analyze their own consumer data and third-party data. Other competitors for our products include in-house tools and custom solutions currently used by brand advertisers to manage their customer data and advertising and marketing activities. We also face competition in our location-based solutions from other companies such as GroundTruth, PlaceIQ, NinthDecimal, MaxPoint and 4INFO. As our platforms evolve and we introduce new technologies, features and functionality, we may face competition from new sources.\nWe also compete with services offered through large online portals that have significant brand recognition, such as Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook. These large portals have substantial proprietary digital advertising inventory that may provide them with competitive advantages, including far greater access to Internet user data, and the ability to significantly influence pricing for digital advertising inventory. Furthermore, these portals may not offer some of their premium, or even all of their inventory, for sale, but instead, use it in their own captive advertising activities. We also compete for a share of advertisers\u2019 total advertising budgets with online search advertising, for which we do not offer a solution, and with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, broadcast television, radio, cable and print. Some of our competitors have also established reputations for specific services, such as retargeting with dynamic creative, for which we do not have an established market presence. Many current and potential competitors have competitive advantages relative to us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger client bases, greater access to advertising inventory on premium websites and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our products, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which may adversely affect our revenue, future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nIn order to be competitive in our evolving industry, we must develop new product offerings and introduce enhancements that include new features and functionality that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments.\nWe operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new advertising solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new advertising industry standards may render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing platform and to continually introduce or acquire new technologies and features and functionality demanded by the market we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on many factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, appropriate introduction and market acceptance. Any new solution, product or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet evolving customer requirements, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nFurther, the planned timing and introduction of new products and services are subject to risks and uncertainties. Unexpected technical, operational, deployment, distribution or other problems may delay or prevent the introduction of new products and services, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur belief that there is demand for our Insights products may be inaccurate, and we may not realize a return from our investments in that area.\nWe believe there is growing demand for our Insights data, and we have made investments to meet that demand through internal development efforts and personnel expansion. The market for these products is still developing and may not grow as we expect, or it may have slow adoption rates for various reasons, including reluctance of some sellers to replace their existing consumer insights data providers with our products. Even if the market for these products develops as we anticipate, buyers and sellers might not embrace our offerings to the degree we expect due to various factors. For example, we may not be successful in building out these offerings consistent with our vision, or competitive offerings may be offered at lower prices or be perceived as having better features and functionality. We may also be unable to scale our product the way we currently anticipate due to regulatory or operational requirements with which we are unable to comply.\nSeasonal fluctuations in digital advertising activity may result in material fluctuations of our revenue, cash flows, operating results, and other key performance measures from period to period.\nOur revenue, advertising expenditures, cash flow from operations, operating results, and other key performance measures may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing, and advertising inventory in the fourth quarter may be more expensive due to increased demand for advertising inventory. As a result, any events that reduce the amount of advertising expenditures during the fourth quarter or reduce the amount of inventory available to customers during that period, may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our revenue and operating results for a given fiscal year.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the holiday season may affect our financial results.\nHistorically, a high percentage of our annual sales have been attributable to the winter holiday selling season. In contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits, which are not seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on our results from operations in the short term.\nAny forecasts of market growth that we have provided or may provide in the future may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow in the future.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in advertising and other markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not be able to grow our business. Our future growth is dependent on many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nWe may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use, and we may become subject to claims of infringement on others\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other arrangements with employees, actual and prospective customers and actual or prospective capital providers and their agents and advisors, and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights. These measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or services similar or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws that are in effect in the United States.\nAlthough we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights, our efforts may not be successful. From time to time, we may litigate within the United States or abroad to enforce our issued or licensed patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others. Enforcing or defending our proprietary rights can involve complex factual and legal questions and can be expensive, would require management\u2019s attention and may not bring us timely or effective relief.\nFurthermore, third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Although there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits or other proceedings against us at this time, we may face litigation or infringement claims in the future, which may result in the assessment of substantial monetary damages against us. Infringement claims may result in substantial judgments against us and may result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, even if we ultimately prevail. A third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief, which may effectively block our use of allegedly infringing intellectual property. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all.\nSITO Mobile, our former chief executive officer, our former chief financial officer, and certain former members of our Board, have been named as parties to various lawsuits arising out of, or related to, alleged violations of various federal securities laws and SEC rules and regulations and those lawsuits may adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows to suffer.\nA putative federal securities class action complaint has been filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Either favorable or unfavorable outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, due to defense costs, diversion of management resources, imposition of financial penalties or judgements against us and other factors.\nOur Company is subject to litigation claims and general risks of litigation.\nWe are involved on an ongoing basis in various forms of litigation and arbitration proceedings with a variety of parties including but not limited to employees, former employees, current and former stockholders, customers, vendors and suppliers arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, stockholders and employees, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or intellectual property matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and adverse litigation trends and outcomes may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, in November 2017, we received a complaint filed by Fort Ashford Funds, LLC (\u201cAshford\u201d), in the Superior Court of the State of California, Orange County (the \u201cAshford Complaint\u201d). The Ashford Complaint claims that we issued certain warrants to Panzarella Consulting, LLC and Patrick Panzarella (together \u201cPanzarella\u201d) representing the option to purchase, in the aggregate, five million (5,000,000) shares of our common stock at a price of fifty cents ($.50) per share. Through a series of purported transfers, the warrants were allegedly transferred to Ashford, which is now seeking to exercise such purported warrants or to obtain damages. However, we have made a thorough inquiry into these matters and, while it appears that certain warrants may have been issued in 2005, such warrants expired in 2015. Further, as of this time, Ashford has failed to provide any evidence of the right of Ashford (and its assignor Anthony Macaluso) to exercise such warrants. We believe these claims are baseless and plan to defend this action accordingly. Notwithstanding our view as to the lack of merit to these claims, this proceeding may distract us and cost our management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims and threats made by Ashford and its affiliates. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of this action, and in the event we do not prevail in such action, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nComplying with securities laws and regulations is costly for us.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ, create challenges for smaller publicly-held companies like us. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities may be delisted.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or \u201cNASDAQ,\u201d under the symbol \u201cSITO\u201d, and we also have outstanding warrants listed on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cSITO\u201d. For our common stock to continue to be listed on NASDAQ, we must meet the current NASDAQ continued listing requirements. If we were unable to meet these requirements, our common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ. If our securities were to be delisted from NASDAQ, our securities may continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting from NASDAQ, or on the Pink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such delisting of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it may have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will meet NASDAQ\u2019s requirements, such as the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement and the minimum bid price requirement, during any compliance period or in the future, or otherwise meet NASDAQ compliance standards, or that NASDAQ will grant the Company any relief from delisting as necessary, or that we will be able to ultimately meet applicable NASDAQ requirements for any such relief.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations, which may subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At December 31, 2018, we had gross, pretax U.S. federal NOLs of $63.6 million. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership may result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. On April 3, 2017, our Board adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in an effort to diminish the risk that our ability to utilize NOLs to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. We have recorded a valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets. Our NOLs may expire unutilized or underutilized, which would prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nThe comprehensive tax reform bill signed into law in December 2017 may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the final version of the tax reform bill commonly known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d or the TCJA, that significantly reforms the Code with many of its provisions effective for tax years beginning on January 1, 2018. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a permanent reduction of the corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, a limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, an indefinite net operating loss carryforward, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. While we have not experienced adverse effects of the TCJA during the 2018 tax year, we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future as we look to grow our revenue and operating income.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may negatively affect us or holders of our stock.\nThe TCJA makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including corporations. There remains uncertainty as to the impact of the TCJA on an investment in our stock. You should consult with your tax advisor regarding the effect of the TCJA and other potential changes to the U.S. federal tax laws prior to purchasing our stock.\nRisks Relating to our Industry\nDemand for some of the services we provide is not yet well established.\nBrand owners who are potential users of the services we provide must weigh their decisions in light of limited budgets for marketing and notification, the inertia of dealing with well-established providers of traditional modalities for marketing and notification, lack of experience with services such as ours, the perception (whether or not well founded) of technological risk and concerns about the cost-effectiveness of our services. There are indications that the market among major brand owners for services such as ours is in an early stage of development.\nSystem or network failures may reduce our sales, increase costs or result in a loss of end users of our products.\nAny failure of, or technical problem with, carriers\u2019 or third parties\u2019 billing systems, delivery or information systems, or communications networks may result in the inability of end users to receive communications or download our products, prevent the completion of a billing transaction or interfere with access to some aspects of our products. If any of these systems fail or if there is an interruption in the supply of power, an earthquake, superstorm, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or an act of war or terrorism, end users may be unable to access our offerings. For example, from time to time, our carriers have experienced failures with their billing and delivery systems and communication networks, including gateway failures that reduced the provisioning capacity of their branded e-commerce system. Any failure of, or technical problem with, the carriers\u2019, third parties\u2019 or our systems may cause us to lose end users or revenues or incur substantial repair costs and distract management from operating our business or persuade retailers or brand owners that solutions utilizing our programs are not sufficiently reliable. This, in turn, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial defects or errors in our platform may result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our platform.\nThe software applications underlying our platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability, misallocation of advertising expenditures or other performance problems. Any such errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform may negatively impact our business and our customers\u2019 businesses or the success of their advertising campaigns and cause customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. If we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform, customers may reduce their usage or delay or withhold payment to us, which may result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or lengthen our collection cycles for accounts receivable. Such performance problems may also result in customers making warranty or other claims against us, our giving credits to our customers toward future advertising expenditures or costly litigation. As a result, material defects or errors in our platform may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\nOur business model depends upon our ability to continue to access advertising inventory that we do not own.\nOur platform depends on access to advertising inventory controlled by publishers and various other providers, such as public advertising exchanges, supply-side platforms, private marketplaces, advertising networks and direct premium publishers. We rely on continued access to premium advertising inventory in high-quality and brand-safe environments, viewable to consumers across multiple screens. We do not own the inventory of advertising opportunities upon which our business depends and, therefore, we may not always have access to advertising inventory of sufficient quality or volume to meet the needs of our customers\u2019 campaigns. As a result, we may have limited visibility to our future access to inventory. Companies such as advertising networks make media buying commitments to publishers and may compete with us and restrict our access to media inventory of those publishers. Companies such as advertising exchanges charge both publishers and advertisers\u2019 fees and may be able to charge advertisers lower fees than us. In addition, many publishers sell a portion of their advertising inventory directly to advertisers, and publishers may seek to do so increasingly in the future. If that were to occur, we may have fewer opportunities to provide our customers access to inventory, which would adversely affect our ability to grow our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from real-time bidding technologies, or RTB, exchanges and that utilize advertising solutions providers continues to increase, intermediaries or their bidding processes may favor other bidders and we may not be able to compete successfully for advertising inventory available on RTB exchanges. Even if our bids are successful, the inventory may be of low quality or misrepresented to us, despite our attempts to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks on inventory and we may be subject to liability and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to collect and use significant amounts of data to deliver advertisements, and any limitations on the collection and use of this data may significantly diminish the value of our products.\nOur ability to optimize the placement and scheduling of advertisements for our customers and to increase adoption of our products depends on our ability to successfully leverage data that we collect from our customers, sellers, and third-parties such as data providers. Our ability to successfully leverage such data, in turn, depends on our ability to collect and obtain rights to utilize such data.\nWhen we deliver an advertisement, we are often able to collect anonymous information about the placement of the advertisement and the interaction of the user with the advertisement. We and our third-party data providers currently employ various tracking technologies, such as pixels and automatic content recognition technology, to collect the data we use to conduct ad campaigns. These tracking technologies are used to collect information related to the consumer, such as demographic information and history of the consumer\u2019s interactions with our advertisers\u2019 and our sellers\u2019 websites, and any ads we deliver. We may also be able to collect information about the user\u2019s location. As we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions and the data acquired from third-party providers, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and delivery of ads across the advertising inventory provided to us by sellers.\nIncreased prevalence of ad-blocking has prompted examination of the effect of digital advertising industry practices upon the quality of user experiences, and changes in industry practices may emerge as a result. Such changes may reduce the viability of our existing business model, place us at a competitive disadvantage, or require us to invest significantly in developing new technologies and business practices.\nIf the use of digital advertising is generally rejected by mobile application and Internet users, through opt-out or ad-blocking technologies or other means, or if other consumer choice mechanisms like \u201cDo Not Track\u201d and \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d inhibit our ability to collect and use data about end users, our performance may decline and we may lose customers and revenue.\nInternet users can, with increasing ease, implement practices or technologies that may limit our ability to collect and use data to deliver advertisements, or otherwise inhibit the effectiveness of our solution. Some Internet users also download free or paid \u201cad blocking\u201d software, not only for privacy reasons, such as a desire to avoid being targeted for ads based upon location or online activity, but also to counteract the adverse effect advertisements can have on users\u2019 experience, including increased load times, data consumption, and screen overcrowding. Similar ad-blocking technology has also emerged for mobile devices. Such ad-blocking technology may prevent certain tracking technologies from being stored on a user\u2019s mobile device. If more Internet users adopt these measures, our business may be adversely affected. Ad-blocking technologies may have an adverse effect on our business if it reduces the volume or effectiveness (and therefore value) of advertising. In addition, some ad blocking technologies block only ads that are targeted through use of third-party data, while allowing ads based on first-party data (i.e. data owned by the provider of the website or application being viewed). These ad blockers may place us at a disadvantage because we rely on third-party data, while large competitors have troves of first-party data they use to direct advertising. Other technologies allow ads that are deemed \u201cacceptable,\u201d which may be defined in ways that place us or our clients at a disadvantage, particularly if such technologies are controlled or influenced by our competitors. Even if ad blockers do not ultimately have a material impact on our business, investor concerns about ad blockers may cause our stock price to decline.\nIncreased prevalence of ad blocking has prompted examination of the effect of digital advertising industry practices upon the quality of user experiences, and changes in industry practices may emerge as a result. Such changes may reduce the viability of our existing business model, place us at a competitive disadvantage, or require us to invest significantly in developing new technologies and business practices.\nIn addition to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d options, certain mobile devices allow users to \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d on their devices. Like \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d is a signal that is sent by particular mobile devices when a user chooses to send such a signal. While there is no clear guidance on how third parties must respond upon receiving such a signal, it is possible that customers, sellers, regulators, or future legislation may dictate a response that would limit our access to data, and consequently negatively impact the effectiveness of our solution and the value of our services on mobile devices.\nFinally, network carriers, providers of mobile device operating systems, and device manufacturers may also impact our ability to collect data on Internet-connected devices. These carriers, operating system providers, and device manufacturers are increasingly promoting features that allow device users to disable some of the functionality of the device or its operating system, which may impair or disable the collection of data on their devices. Any interruptions, failures, or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis, and storage systems may limit our ability to aggregate and analyze user data from our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our customers, which may make our products less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenue may decline.\nIf we fail to detect fraudulent or unacceptable ad placements, or if we serve advertisements on websites with inappropriate content, our reputation will be damaged, advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, and we may incur liabilities.\nOur business depends in part on providing our advertisers with services that are trusted and safe for their brands and that provide the anticipated value. We frequently have contractual commitments to take reasonable measures to prevent advertisements from appearing on websites with inappropriate content or on certain websites that our advertisers may identify. Our advertisers also expect that ad placements will not be misrepresented, such as auto-play in banner placements marketed as pre-roll inventory, and that ad impressions represent the legitimate activity of human Internet users. We use proprietary technologies in our efforts to detect and block inventory on websites with inappropriate content, misrepresented ad placements and fraudulent bot generated impressions. However, technologies utilized by bad actors are constantly evolving and preventing and combating fraud and inappropriate content, which is an industry-wide issue, requires constant vigilance and investment of time and resources. There has recently been a significant amount of negative publicity about bot generated impressions within our industry, so our ability to combat bot generated impressions has become increasingly important. We may not always be successful in our efforts to prevent and combat fraud and inappropriate content. We may serve advertisements on inventory that is objectionable to our advertisers, and our software may also inadvertently purchase inventory on behalf of our advertisers that proves to be unacceptable for advertising campaigns, such as fraudulent bot generated impressions. In addition, negative publicity around fraudulent digital advertising placements may adversely impact the perceptions of advertisers regarding programmatic purchasing of digital advertising. As a result, we may lose the trust of our advertisers, which would adversely affect our brand and reputation, our advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may be exposed to liabilities or the need to provide credits or refunds, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDigital advertising is relatively new, dependent on growth in various digital advertising channels, and vulnerable to adverse public perceptions and increased regulatory responses. If this market develops more slowly or differently than we expect, or if issues encountered by other participants or the industry generally are imputed to or affect us, our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe digital advertising industry is complex and evolving, and the relatively few publicly traded companies operating in the business tend to be small and new to the public markets. Consequently, the digital advertising industry may not be as widely followed or understood in the financial markets as more mature industries. The markets may not fully appreciate our particular place in the industry and our strengths and differentiating factors. Problems experienced by one industry participant (even private companies) or issues affecting a part of the industry have the potential to have adverse effects on other participants in the industry or even the entire industry. Emerging understanding of how the digital advertising industry operates has spurred privacy concerns and misgivings about exploitation of consumer information and prompted regulatory responses that limit operational flexibility and impose compliance costs upon industry participants. Any expansion of the market for digital advertising solutions depends on a number of factors, including social and regulatory acceptance, the growth of the overall digital advertising market and the growth of specific sectors including social, mobile, video, and out-of-home as well as the actual or perceived technological viability, quality, cost, performance and value associated with emerging digital advertising solutions. If demand for digital display advertising and adoption of automation does not continue to grow, or if digital advertising solutions or advertising automation do not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for digital advertising caused by weakening economic conditions, decreases in corporate spending, quality, viewability, malware issues or other issues associated with customers, advertising channels or inventory, negative perceptions of digital advertising, additional regulatory requirements, or other factors, or if we fail to develop or acquire capabilities to meet the evolving business and regulatory requirements and needs of customers and sellers of multi-channel advertising, our competitive position will be weakened and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf our information systems are disrupted or there is unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, our reputation may be adversely affected, and/or we may incur significant liabilities.\nWe collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, our advertisers. Security breaches may result in the loss of information or financial assets, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place, our information systems and networks and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk and ongoing threats. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks such as viruses, hacking, phishing attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. This may result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data, our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our financial assets. Such attacks may also cause interruptions to the services we provide and cause customers to lose confidence in our platform. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material impact on our systems; however, there can be no assurance that such attacks may not be successful in the future.\nThird parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information or our financial assets. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent other security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures may be adversely affected, we may lose potential sales and existing customers or we may be subject to liability.\nIn addition, we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting/cloud computing providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, may adversely impact our business and results of operations, our ability to accurately report our financial results, as well as the experience of our customers. As we expand our operations, we expect to utilize additional systems and service providers that may also be essential to managing our business. Although the systems and services that we require are typically available from a number of providers, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement these relationships. Therefore, our ability to manage our business would suffer if one or more of our providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add systems and services. We may not be able to control the quality of the systems and services we receive from third-party service providers, which may impair our ability to maintain proper controls over financial reporting and complete timely and accurate financial reporting, and may impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nLegislation and regulation of online businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. Such regulation may create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, restrict portions of our business or cause us to change our technology platform or business model.\nGovernment regulation may increase the costs of doing business online. Federal, state, municipal and foreign governments and agencies (although we do not currently have operations outside of the U.S. and Canada, in the future, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of other foreign jurisdictions) have adopted and may in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, and regulations covering user privacy, data security, technologies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, advertising online, the use of data to inform advertising, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual Internet users. Although we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, address, telephone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial data or health data, we typically do collect and store IP addresses and other device identifiers, which are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. In addition, certain U.S. laws impose requirements on the collection and use of information from or about users or their devices. For instance, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under the age of 13 years of age. COPPA requires notice and parental consent to include persistent identifiers for behavioral advertising and other tracking across websites. Other existing laws may in the future be revised, or new laws may be passed, to impose more stringent requirements on the use of identifiers to collect user information, including information of the type that we collect. Changes in regulations may affect the type of data that we may collect, restrict our ability to use identifiers to collect information, and, thus, affect our ability to collect data, the costs of doing business online, and affect the demand for our platform, the ability to expand or operate our business, and adversely affect our business.\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators also may implement \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d legislation, particularly if the industry does not implement a self-regulation standard (discussed above). The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 requires operators of commercial websites and online service providers, under certain circumstances, to disclose in their privacy policies how such operators and providers respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.\nIn addition, we may inadvertently receive personal information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of executing advertising campaigns or usage of our platform. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, may result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.\nIn addition, data security is of increasing concern to U.S., state and foreign regulators, and, as a result, the legal standards for data security and the consequences for violating those standards continue to evolve and the threat posed by cyber-attacks and data breaches continues to grow. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use, and disclose in the operation of our business, and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information, such measures may not always be effective.\nFailure to comply with industry self-regulation may harm our brand, reputation and our business.\nIn addition to compliance with government regulations, we voluntarily participate in trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct addressing privacy and the provision of digital advertising. However, in the past, some of these guidelines have not comported with our business practices, making them difficult for us to implement. If we encounter difficulties in the future, or our opt-out mechanisms fail to work as designed, or if digital media users misunderstand our technology or our commitments with respect to these principles, we may be subject to negative publicity, as well as investigation and litigation by governmental authorities, self-regulatory bodies or other accountability groups, customers, sellers, or other private parties. Any such action against us may be costly and time consuming, require us to change our business practices, divert management\u2019s attention and our resources, and be damaging to our reputation and our business. In addition, we may be adversely affected by new or altered self-regulatory guidelines that are inconsistent with our practices or in conflict with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and other countries where we do business. As a result of such inconsistencies or conflicts, or other business or legal considerations, we may choose not to comply with some self-regulatory guidelines. Additionally, as we expand geographically, we may begin to operate in jurisdictions that have self-regulatory groups in which we do not participate. If we fail to abide by or are perceived as not operating in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and industry best practices, or any industry guidelines or codes with regard to privacy or the provision of Internet advertising, our reputation may suffer, and we may lose relationships with customers and sellers.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nActions of activist stockholders against us may be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or seek representation on, or control of, our Board may cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and an activist campaign that results in a change in control of our Board may trigger change in control provisions or payments under certain of our material contracts and agreements.\nStockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, submit advance stockholder proposals, make Board nominations or otherwise attempt to effect changes, assert influence or acquire some level of control over us.\nIf an activist campaign that seeks to replace at least a majority of the members of the Board, a change in control of the Board may be deemed to have occurred under certain of our material contracts and agreements, and such a change in control may trigger certain fundamental change and/or change in control provisions, payments, and/or redemptions under certain of our outstanding indebtedness, our employment agreements with certain of our named executive officers, our equity compensation plans and possibly some of our other plans and agreements.\nTrading in our stock has been modest, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices. Moreover, modest volume can increase stock price volatility.\nBecause there is limited trading in our common stock, it may be difficult for investors to sell or buy substantial quantities of our shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Moreover, the market price for shares of our common stock may be made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused by the trading of a relatively small number of shares.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCommon stock prices are often significantly influenced by the research and reports that securities analysts publish about companies and their business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our common stock is covered by securities analysts and our stock is downgraded, our stock price will likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports about us, we may lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which may lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results (including whether we have achieved our key business targets and/or earnings estimates) and prospects;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, business successes, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market (particularly if overall trading volume is not high);\n\u25cf actual or anticipated monetization of our patents;\n\u25cf general market conditions and broader political and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies, and in particular the market prices of stock in smaller companies and technology companies have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not reflect the market price of our common stock at any subsequent time. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, may result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\nWe do not expect any cash dividends to be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, as well as any capital that may be raised in the future, to fund our business growth. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on investment would be for the price of our common stock to appreciate. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment in us.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 105,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board.\nThe holders of options and warrants to purchase our common stock can be expected to exercise the options and/or warrants at a time when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise price of these outstanding securities. If these options to purchase our common stock are exercised, or other equity interests are granted under our 2017 stock plan, or under other plans or agreements adopted in the future, such equity interests will have a dilutive effect on your ownership of common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. Such securities may be issued at below-market prices or, in any event, prices that are significantly lower than the price at which you may have paid for your shares. The future issuance of any such securities may create downward pressure on, or dampen any upward trend in, the trading price of our common stock.\nDelaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board has adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, each of which may delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nDelaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated Bylaws contain certain provisions, and our Board recently adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an expiration date of April 3, 2020 and an ownership trigger threshold of 4.99%, each of which may render more difficult, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board. The Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer, or other business combinations approved by our Board. The rights agreement does not prevent our Board from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15644, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SITO"}
