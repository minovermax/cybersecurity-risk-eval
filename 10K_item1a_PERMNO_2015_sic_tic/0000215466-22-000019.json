{"cik": "215466", "company": "Coeur Mining, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nOur results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver, and, if mining and processing operations at Silvertip resume, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control.\nGold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table:\nGold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (\u201cETFs\u201d), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental monetary decisions regarding central bank holdings.\nBecause we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.\nOperating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflation, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities.\nAlthough our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 17% between January 27, 2021 and February 1, 2021, and then decreased by 8% on February 2, 2021. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 44% and decreased by 19% during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period.\nThe estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.\nThe mineral reserve and mineral resource figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral\nreserves and mineral resources containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and alter our mining plans. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or dor\u00e9 as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver dor\u00e9 and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States. We believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, shipping delays, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create (or the necessity to terminate) a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services.\nAny delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell dor\u00e9 and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our dor\u00e9 or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nThere are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.\nWe maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions, and there is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nOur future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties.\nBecause mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of new mining properties, such as the Silvertip development property, the Sterling/Crown project and the Lincoln Hill project and related assets.\nWhile initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing new underground mining operations. At Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll (\u201cHPGR\u201d) technology was commissioned in 2019, and, in 2020, we obtained permitting for, and began construction of POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion, including the\nconstruction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two HPGR units and a prescreen, processing facilities and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester\u2019s mine life. At Kensington, we completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and are currently seeking to amend our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits (\u201cPOA 1\u201d). Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, extreme weather events, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. The construction services related to POA 11 will be performed by contractors, which creates a risk of delays or additional costs to the project resulting from, among other factors: inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. Expected project benefits are based on estimates of a variety of key factors, including mineral reserves and resources, grade, recovery rates, and operating costs among others. However, achieving results in line with those estimates is subject to risks and uncertainties such as variability in grade, recovery rates and cost inputs. In 2021, Rochester experienced lower than expected silver recovery rates from its HPGR-crushed ore, which negatively impacted production, costs and cash flow. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, such as expected availability, throughput, metal recovery rates, concentrate quality, unit costs, operating margin and/or cash flows, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.\nIn addition, we acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling/Crown project, the Lincoln Hill project and related assets and the Silvertip development property. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip development property or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.\nWe regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.\nOur operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, poses a material risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. In addition, we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities during this pandemic, including COVID-19 testing, site access symptom checks, contact tracing technology and procuring additional disinfectant and sanitation products and personal protective equipment for our employees, among others, some of which have and may result in additional costs to us.\nIllnesses or government restrictions, including the closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 also may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. We also continue to monitor legislative initiatives in the U.S., Mexico and Canada related to COVID-19 to determine their potential impacts or benefits (if any) to our business.\nThird parties with whom we conduct business, including the refiners and smelters that, process and, in some cases, purchase the gold and silver dor\u00e9 and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to conduct our operations, advance exploration, development and expansion projects, sell our products and generate revenues.\nWe may be subject to litigation if one or more employees or contractors contract COVID-19 at work or litigation initiated by stockholders who view decisions by the Board of Directors or management as inconsistent with duties to the Company under Delaware law or who may assert claims under federal securities laws. We understand that, as indicated by sharp increases in average premiums for director and officer insurance policies in recent months, insurers expect increased litigation relating to COVID-19.\nThe jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to COVID-19. As a result, national, state or local\ngovernments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes that affect our business, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine, Sterling/Crown project and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds derived from mining gold and silver.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section as well as those contained in the 2020 10-K, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions.\nThere can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions (including the Silvertip development property and the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip development property, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired.\nIn addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:\n\u2022a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;\n\u2022additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;\n\u2022issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Sterling/Crown, Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders;\n\u2022a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations;\n\u2022processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;\n\u2022difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies and supporting expanded operations, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization;\n\u2022difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people; and\n\u2022the acquired business or assets may have significant liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated.\nWe cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional liabilities, indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations.\nSignificant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.\nOur plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations, including the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and the POA 1 planned mine life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several\nmonths or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks described in this Item, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.\nMineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nIn addition, exploration projects, such as the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nWe may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset\u2019s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reported period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated.\nFor example, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the Silvertip property and determined that indicators of impairment existed, and we ultimately concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets for the Silvertip property was impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $250.8 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIf there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCoeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 20 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana\u2019s prior royalty agreement, including through ongoing litigation and potential international arbitration. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its VAT recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the VAT receivable and recent unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the VAT receivable of $26.0 million at September 2021. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.\nAny of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks.\nOur operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe sell silver and gold dor\u00e9, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.\nOur ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities. No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.\nWaste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington and Palmarejo Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams\nand operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts. The significant dam failure events that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineral reserves and resources and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.\nOur estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralization, recovery rates, our costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and dor\u00e9 and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them.\nOur use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk.\nFrom time-to-time, we have in the past and in the future may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we entered into price risk management contracts on a total of 483,700 ounces of expected gold production for 2020, 2021 and 2022 after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and 2020. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as POA 11. As of December 31, 2021, contracts with respect to 132,000 ounces of gold were outstanding. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages approximately $2,038 per ounce for 2022 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. On February 14, 2022, the closing price of gold was $1,866 per ounce. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and other risks associated with implementation and integration.\nOur information technology systems used in our operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in\ndesign. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees.\nWe may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nContinuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to enforcement of water rights, claims and uses, or potential pressure from other users of water, government agencies and officials, and/or non-governmental organizations to limit the amount of water made available to or used for mining activities, regardless of legally valid water rights. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts outside of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, ongoing litigation to enforce existing water rights, ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights and/or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, adversely affecting our existing operations or our expansion or development plans.\nWe may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets.\nWe have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets and annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period.\nRISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\nOur future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $487.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, among other factors described in this Item. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.\nIf our cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nThe terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;\n\u2022require us to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;\n\u2022require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the\nvalue of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business.\nMining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.\nU.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling/Crown project are frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip development property and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.\nEnvironmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSome of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (\u201cMEBA\u201d), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a storage facility designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d). Near the end of 2019, the DOE designated a facility and issued a long-term management and storage fee rule; however, the facility designation process and fee was subjected to legal challenges by us and other third parties. Following legal challenges by Coeur and others, the DOE agreed to vacate the 2019 rule and commence a new rule making process in 2021. The future rule could result in material cost being incurred to ship\nand store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a \u201cSuperfund\u201d site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the \"GLEBPE\") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nAirborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota, and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.\nWe are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for POA 11 at Rochester and the permitting effort currently underway for POA 1 at Kensington. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations.\nPrivate parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate.\nIf future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, our plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nDisputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations.\nThe validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of our exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nIn Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.\nWe are subject to tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden\u2019s administration (the \u201cAdministration\u201d) has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform.\nThe Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nCurrently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate.\nIn addition, new tax legislation in certain jurisdictions where we operate could negatively affect us. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine, Sterling/Crown project and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds\nderived from mining gold and silver. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for even more significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate will be passed and if passed, the impact of those changes on the Company. Any additional taxes imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nWe have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 24441, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "CDE"}
