The government has announced the following channels that will be included in the first digital multiplex: Channel One, Rossiya 1, Rossiya 2, Rossiya 24, Rossiya K, Channel 5, NTV, Karousel, TVC and Public TV of Russia (OTR). The government also determined the following channels that will be included in the second multiplex: REN-TV, Spas, TV-3, NTV Sport Plus, MIR, Zvezda, TNT, Muz TV, as well as two of our channels, CTC and Domashny. The transition to digital broadcasting is expected to impact competition among the channels in terms of audience share, due to the changes in relative technical penetration. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-We face additional expenditures in connection with the planned transition from analog to digital broadcasting in\nRussia and Kazakhstan, and the necessary investments for digital migration may not be fully monetized\".\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely heavily upon the rights we obtain through license agreements with programming providers for a substantial portion of the content we broadcast. We have registered trademarks for the \"CTC\", \"Domashny\", \"Peretz\" and \"CTC Media\" name and logo in the Russian Federation. In 2014, we have registered the logo of \"Peretz\", our new CTC Network logo, our new trade mark \"Tz\" for our Peretz channel, our interactive internet video platform \"Videomore\" and the logo of our fourth channel \"CTC Love\". In 2014, we applied to the authorities for registration of restyled logos of our channel Domashny. We expect that these logos will be registered by the end 2015, or early in 2016.\nWe have registered trademarks for the \"CTC Media\" name and logo in Australia, Singapore, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Georgia, Cyprus, Hungary, Benelux, Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Austria, Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Finland, France, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden and additional countries in accordance with the international trademark registration procedure under the Madrid Protocol. In 2014, we have also registered trademarks for the \"CTC Media\" name and logo in Canada.\nEmployees\nThe following table sets forth the number of our employees as of December 31, 2014, and a breakdown by function.\nManagement changes\nIn January 2014, Lika Blank was appointed as Head of Domashny channel. In November 2014, Elmira Makhmutova was appointed as Head of CTC channel. In December 2014, Ruben Oganesyan was appointed as Head of Peretz channel. Effective January 24, 2015, Stanislav Ploshenko was appointed as Chief Financial Officer.\nFinancial Information by Operating Segment\nFor financial information by operating segment, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 18, Segment Information\".\nAmendment to Mass Media Law\nIn October 2014, an amendment to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\", was adopted, which will reduce the permitted level of foreign ownership in Russian mass media companies, including television broadcasters, from 50% direct ownership to 20% beneficial ownership or controls, direct or indirect. The law does not provide for \"grandfathering\" of existing foreign ownership interests. The law will come into force on January 1, 2016, by which time each Russian mass media entity, including television broadcasters, must comply with the requirement that non-Russian entities and individuals in the aggregate beneficially own or control no greater than 20% of the relevant mass media entity. Russian entities and individuals that beneficially own interests in Russian mass media businesses greater than 20% through off-shore holding structures will have an additional year in which to restructure such foreign holding structures. In the event of non-compliance by the stated deadline, the Russian government would have the authority to revoke the mass media registration and broadcasting licenses of our business, and CTC Media would be unable to exercise its voting rights in respect of our Russian operating subsidiaries. The adoption of the Mass Media Law creates significant uncertainty for CTC Media and its stockholders.\nCTC Media is a Delaware corporation that directly and indirectly owns 100% of the shares of a series of Russian legal entities that operate the CTC business in Russia. CTC Media's stockholders include MTG Russia AB, a Swedish company that is 100% indirectly owned by Modern Times Group MTG AB, a Swedish listed company, which holds approximately 39% of CTCM's outstanding common stock; Telcrest Investments Limited, a Cypriot limited company that we understand is indirectly beneficially owned by Russian entities and individuals, which holds approximately 25% of CTCM's outstanding common stock; and a number of public stockholders, which we understand include numerous US and European investors, which together hold the remaining approximately 36% of CTCM's outstanding common stock. If we are unable to take steps to restructure our operations in such a way that achieves compliance with this law while retaining our current ownership structure, we may be required to an effect a sale of 80% or more of CTC Media or of our Russian businesses. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock\".\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe file reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which are available on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document we file at the SEC Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You should call 1-800-SEC-0330 for more information on the public reference room.\nOur internet address is www.ctcmedia.ru. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, particularly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also become important factors that affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis of the risks we face might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nRecently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\nOn October 14, 2014, President Putin signed into law an amendment to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\", which will reduce the permitted level of foreign ownership in Russian mass media companies, including television broadcasters, from 50% direct ownership to 20% beneficial ownership or control, direct or indirect. The law does not provide for \"grandfathering\" of existing foreign ownership interests. The law will come into force on January 1, 2016, by which time each Russian mass media entity, including television broadcasters, must comply with the requirement that non-Russian entities and individuals in the aggregate beneficially own no greater than 20% of the relevant mass media entity. Russian entities and individuals that beneficially own interests in Russian mass media businesses greater than 20% through off-shore holding structures will have an additional year in which to restructure such foreign holding structures.\nCTC Media is a Delaware corporation that directly and indirectly owns 100% of the shares of a series of Russian legal entities that operate the CTC business in Russia. CTC Media's Russian operations have historically contributed more than 96% of the group's revenues and net income. CTC Media's stockholders include MTG Russia AB, a Swedish company that is 100% indirectly owned by Modern Times Group MTG AB, a Swedish listed company, which holds approximately 39% of CTCM's outstanding common stock; Telcrest Investments Limited, a Cypriot limited company that we understand is indirectly beneficially owned by Russian entities and individuals, which holds approximately 25% of CTCM's outstanding common stock; and a number of public stockholders, which we understand include numerous US and European investors, which together hold the remaining approximately 36% of CTCM's outstanding common stock. As a consequence, neither our Delaware parent company nor the current beneficial ownership structure of our group would currently comply with the requirements of the new law. In the event of non-compliance by the stated deadline, the Russian government would have the authority to revoke the mass media registration and broadcasting licenses of our business, and our parent company would be unable to exercise its voting rights in our Russian subsidiaries. The enactment of this law therefore creates significant uncertainty regarding our ownership, and may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors, through its Advisory Committee, is continuing to work with our management and with external legal, financial and tax advisors to identify, evaluate and implement an appropriate response that achieves compliance with the requirements of the new law while safeguarding the interest of all of our stockholders. The Board continues to consider a variety of potential\nalternatives, including corporate restructuring, franchising and licensing structures, capital reorganization and divestments. These alternatives include, among others, a potential sale transaction of the group's Russian businesses or of the shares of our common stock.\nIf the Board were to pursue a sale of the business, there can be no assurance that it would be successful in negotiating a transaction on acceptable terms or at all. In particular, any disposal may not result in proceeds at a level that reflects the underlying value of our business, particularly in light of ongoing volatility of the Russian economy and contraction of the advertising market, as well as the limitation of the pool of potential purchasers to Russian persons that are not subject to applicable international sanctions. As a result, the value of the common stock of our company could further decline, and you may lose all or a significant portion of your investment.\nIn addition, our response to this new law will require significant Board and management time and attention, which will continue to distract from the normal operations of our business. A sale or restructuring of our Russian operations may also result in significant taxes, in particular in connection with complex corporate transactions in which the application of tax laws may be unclear.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic events have adversely affected and created uncertainty and instability in the Russian economy.\nIn 2014 and early 2015, Russia has experienced economic instability that has been characterized by substantial depreciation of its currency, sharp fluctuations of interest rates, a forecasted decline in the gross domestic product in 2015 and a steep decline in the value of shares traded on its stock exchanges (discussed below). Additionally, because Russia produces and exports large amounts of oil, its economy is particularly vulnerable to the price of oil on the world market and recent substantial decreases in international oil prices have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect its economy.\nDuring December 2014 Russia experienced serious economic volatility, with Russia's Central Bank raising interest rates in response to the weakening ruble. In 2014, the Russian ruble depreciated against the US dollar by 42%. On December 11, 2014, the Central Bank of Russia raised its main lending rate to 10.5%, followed by a further increase on December 15, 2014 to 17%. The rate was reduced by 2% in February 2015 and remains at 15% as at March 1, 2015. In the beginning of 2014, the lending rate was 5.5%. Depreciation of the ruble, increasing inflation and volatility of interest rates are indicative of the general downturn in the Russian economy and may lead to a significant decrease in advertising revenues. If the exchange rate between the Russian ruble and the US dollar remains at its current level or if the Russian ruble depreciates further, our revenues and operating results for 2015, and perhaps future periods, as reported in US dollars, will be materially adversely affected. Further volatility of interest rates may also adversely affect our ability to borrow funds if and when necessary or desirable.\nOn January 26, 2015, the global credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) downgraded Russia's sovereign debt to \"junk\" status. S&P lowered its long- and short-term foreign currency sovereign credit ratings on the Russian Federation to non-investment grade BB+ from investment grade BBB-. The outlook for long-term ratings is considered negative. On February 20, 2015 Moody's Investors Service downgraded Russia's sovereign debt rating to Ba1/Not Prime from Baa3/Prime-3 (P-3). The rating outlook is negative. Further falls in the oil price or deterioration of the situation may lead to further depreciation of the ruble and may lead to Russian sovereign credit rating being downgraded by other credit agencies.\nAs a result of the current global economic instability and any further potential deterioration in the Russian economy, total television advertising spending in Russia may be adversely affected which, in turn, would materially adversely affect our operating results.\nSee also \"-Decreases in the value of the Russian ruble as compared to the US dollar that have resulted from the current economic and political instability in Russia have negatively impacted our reported revenues and operating results. If the exchange rate between the ruble and the US dollar\nremains at its current level or if the ruble depreciates further, our revenues and our operating results, both as reported in US dollars, may continue to be negatively affected\"; and \"-We derive almost all of our revenues from the sale of advertising, which is sensitive to broader economic conditions. Our revenues may substantially decrease if the economic environment deteriorates in Russia or other CIS countries in which we operate.\"\nDecreases in the value of the Russian ruble as compared to the US dollar that have resulted from the current economic and political instability in Russia have negatively impacted our reported revenues and operating results. If the exchange rate between the ruble and the US dollar remains at its current level or if the ruble depreciates further, our revenues and our operating results, both as reported in US dollars, may continue to be negatively affected.\nAlthough our reporting currency is the US dollar, we generate almost all of our revenues through the sale of advertising, which in Russia is sold primarily in rubles. The ruble is also the functional currency of our principal operating subsidiaries. As a result, our reported revenues and results of operations are impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Russian ruble.\nIn 2014, the Russian ruble experienced a significant decline, depreciating against the US dollar by 42%, and was on average 17% lower than the average value of the Russian ruble compared to the US dollar during 2013. This depreciation had a material negative impact on our results of operations for 2014, as reported in US Dollars. The prevailing exchange rate as of December 31, 2014 was RUR 56.3 to $1.00. During the period from January 1, 2015 to March 1, 2015, the value of the Russian ruble depreciated further against the US dollar by approximately 8% to RUR 61.27 to $1.00. Additionally, we face exchange rate risk relating to payments that we must make in currencies other than the ruble. We generally pay for non-Russian produced programming in US dollars. As of December 31, 2014, we had US dollar denominated contractual commitments for the acquisition of approximately $47.3 million in programming rights in 2015, $12.2 million in 2016 and $0.2 million in 2017. In addition, on March 4, 2015, our Board declared a dividend of $0.175 per outstanding share of common stock, or approximately $27.3 million in total. The record date is March 16, 2015 and the payment date is on or about March 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, our US dollar-denominated cash and cash deposits comprised approximately $109.7 million; in addition, as of December 31, 2014, we have outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase approximately $6.5 million at an average exchange rate of RUR 47.7 to $1 in 2015, to reduce a portion of our foreign exchange risk related to US-dollar denominated payments. We have not entered into any arrangements to reduce the foreign exchange risk with respect to the remaining future US dollar denominated payments. See also \"Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Foreign currency exchange risk\".\nThe current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations, and will require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts.\nSignificant uncertainty exists surrounding the current geopolitical situation over Ukraine. Both the United States and the European Union, as well as other countries, have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian government officials, other individuals and certain Russian companies in connection with recent developments in Ukraine and Crimea, as well as \"sectoral\" sanctions affecting specified types of transactions with named participants in certain industries, including named Russian financial institutions, and sanctions that prohibit most commercial activities by U.S. and E.U. persons in Crimea. On March 3, 2015, the White House announced a one-year extension of the Executive Order dated March 6, 2014, which introduced the initial round of Ukraine-related sanctions. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent or timing of any potential further economic or trade sanctions, or the ultimate outcome of the Ukrainian crisis.\nNeither we, nor any of our Russian subsidiaries or other operations or assets, are a target of current sanctions and we do not appear on the United States, European Union or other lists of sanctioned parties. Bank Rossiya and LLC IC Abros, which beneficially own a majority of one of our principal minority shareholders, Telcrest Investments Limited, and Yuri Kovalchuk, who has a significant interest in Bank Rossiya, have been named as parties on the Specially Designated Nationals (\"SDN\") and Blocked Persons List, published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). Due to Bank Rossiya's and LLC IC Abros's majority ownership interest in Telcrest, Telcrest is also deemed to be a SDN. Under the applicable sanctions, we (1) may not engage in any financial or commercial transaction with an SDN; (2) must block any \"property interest\" of an SDN over which we have possession or control; (3) may not facilitate or approve the action of any other party that would violate the sanctions; or (4) may not otherwise evade the sanctions. The European Union and many other countries have imposed similar sanctions.\nAs a result of the sanctions programs, we must engage in additional due diligence of prospective customers, suppliers or other third parties, which may delay or prohibit us from entering into agreements with these third parties. Any negative perception by our international customers or suppliers of our direct and indirect relationship to sanctioned parties, or regarding the overall geopolitical situation, may make it more difficult to do business with these customers or suppliers and may negatively impact our revenue and profitability. In particular, there have been press reports speculating that Video International, the advertising sales house on which we rely for the software used by our internal sales house and for material consulting services and analysis of the advertising market, may be controlled by parties subject to sanctions. According to our due diligence in respect of Video International, the Compliance Committee of our Board has concluded that the evidence does not suggest that Video International is majority owned or otherwise controlled by sanctioned parties. Nevertheless, negative perceptions resulting from our relationship with Video International may result in harm to our reputation or to our relationships with other counterparties. In addition, although we have taken all reasonable efforts to confirm that Video International and our other counterparties are not majority owned or controlled by sanctioned parties, there remains the possibility that we could be found not to be in compliance with applicable legal requirements in respect of sanctions, which could materially adversely harm our business.\nOur compliance with international sanctions could impede our ability to effectively manage our legal entities and operations globally. For example, in February 2015, the Russian Prosecutor General's office issued a statement announcing that local prosecutors, the State Labor Inspectorate and the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service had initiated investigations of Russian companies whose U.S. parent company had adopted group-wide compliance policies that required that all employees comply with applicable international sanctions. The statement claimed that such policies contradict the law of the Russian Federation, and therefore may give rise to violations of Russian law, including labor and anti-monopoly laws. If similar allegations were to be brought against our Russian subsidiaries, and the Russian authorities were successful in claiming that our international sanctions compliance policies violate Russian law, we could be impeded in ensuring the compliance of our group with applicable U.S., E.U. and other legal requirements and could potentially face liability in Russia. In addition, we may be required to seek guidance or licenses from OFAC regarding compliance or in order to proceed to do certain business, and we are subject to OFAC blocking and reporting obligations.\nTelcrest's position as a principal minority shareholder of our company and its right to designate three of the nine members of our Board of Directors present significant compliance challenges for us. We have in place policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the applicable requirements. Such compliance efforts may take substantial time and attention of our management and Board of Directors, including our Compliance Committee, which would otherwise have been focused on other aspects of our business. We may also experience delays in business and corporate governance\nprocesses as a result of the requirements of these policies, including the recusal of Telcrest designated directors from decisions or deliberations on all transactions by our Board.\nApplicable sanctions may also adversely affect our relationships with international banks, advisors and commercial counterparties. We have to date encountered several international banks that have declined to transact business with us, including processing routine payments from us to third parties, as a result of internal compliance policies that are significantly more restrictive than what is required by applicable law. Although these actions have not to date materially adversely affected our operations, if international banks or other international counterparties decline to do business with us because of real or perceived compliance concerns, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial position.\nWe are committed to complying with all applicable laws, including Ukraine-related sanctions. However, if we fail to comply with sanctions requirements, our company and/or our directors and senior management could face administrative, civil and criminal penalties.\nSee also \"-Geopolitical and macroeconomic events have adversely affected and created uncertainty and instability in the Russian economy.\"\nWe derive almost all of our revenues from the sale of advertising, which is sensitive to broader economic conditions. Our revenues may substantially decrease if the economic environment deteriorates in Russia or other CIS countries in which we operate.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenues from advertising. In general, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and buying patterns. Since the introduction of commercial television advertising in Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union, advertising spending has fluctuated substantially, generally increasing during periods of economic growth and decreasing during downturns. The global credit crisis and the related turmoil in the global financial system in 2008 had a material negative impact on the Russian economy, with total spending on television advertising in Russia declining significantly, falling by 18% in 2009 when comparing to 2008. Although in the subsequent years the Russian economy demonstrated recovery and overall Russian television advertising spending grew at a compound annual growth rate of 12% in the period from 2009 to 2013, Russia has experienced significant economic instability in 2014 and early 2015, characterized by depreciation of its currency, a forecasted decline in gross domestic product in 2015 and a steep decline in the value of shares traded on its stock exchanges. In the fourth quarter of 2014, some large advertisers reduced their initially planned advertising expenditures. As result, in 2014, overall Russian television advertising market increased by only approximately 2% in ruble terms when compared to 2013.\nAdditionally, recent decreases in international oil prices may continue to adversely affect Russian economy. As a result of the current global economic instability and any further potential deterioration in the Russian economy, total television advertising spending in Russia may be adversely affected which, in turn, would materially adversely affect our operating results for 2015 and in medium-term.\nAs discussed above, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the current geopolitical situation over Ukraine. Both the United States and the European Union, as well as other countries, have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian government officials, other individuals and certain Russian companies in connection with recent developments over Ukraine and Crimea. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent or timing of any potential further economic or trade sanctions, or the ultimate outcome of the Ukraine crisis. The current situation in Ukraine has negatively affected our sublicensing sales of certain programming in that country and has also had a broader impact on the macroeconomic environment of the region. These factors, in conjunction with global macroeconomic weakness, may adversely affect our business. See also \"-The current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial\nconditions and results of operations, and will require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts\".\nA reduction in our audience shares and ratings would likely result in a reduction in our advertising revenues.\nThe level of advertising revenues that we receive is directly tied to our audience shares and ratings. If our audience shares or ratings were to fall as a result, for example, of competitive pressures, underperformance of key programs, failure to renew licenses, or a change in the method of measuring television audiences, this would likely result in a decrease in our advertising revenues, which could be material. In 2014, the target audience shares of our CTC, Domashny and Peretz channels were below the audience share for 2013, reflecting the increased competition from other channels, including the channels licensed to broadcast the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi in the first quarter of 2014 and political news on the Ukraine crisis, the effect of audience fragmentation and the relative underperformance of certain programming at CTC and Peretz channels.\nOur ability to attract and retain viewers depends primarily on our success in offering programming that appeals to our target audiences. Russian viewer preferences have been changing in recent years, with increasing demand for programming produced in Russia. There is currently a relatively limited supply of Russian-produced programming and strong competition among Russian networks and channels for such programming and Russian production talent, as well as for popular foreign programming.\nFrom time to time we air one or two series during primetime that contribute disproportionately to our overall audience share, resulting in an overall audience share that we may not be able to sustain once that series is discontinued or loses popularity. Moreover, because we continue to rely on third-party production companies for a large portion of our programming and our programming library is not as extensive as those of some of our competitors, we may be unable to quickly substitute new programming for underperforming programming. If we are unable to produce or secure a steady supply of high-quality programming, particularly in the key timeslots, or if we fail to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in Russian viewer tastes or legislation, or to increased competition, by providing appropriate programming, our overall audience shares could be negatively affected, which would adversely affect our advertising revenues. Moreover, if any of the programming we produce, commission or license does not achieve the audience share levels we anticipate, we may be required to write-off all or a portion of the carrying cost of such programming, and we could be forced to broadcast more expensive programming to maintain audience share, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe face additional expenditures in connection with the planned transition from analog to digital broadcasting in Russia and Kazakhstan, and the necessary investments for digital migration may not be fully monetized.\nThe Russian government has announced a federal program to introduce digital broadcasting throughout Russia. Pursuant to a governmental program, the rollout of digital Broadcasting in Russia will be completed in 2019. The government's plan called for digital broadcasting to be introduced in stages, with several packages of digital signals, or \"multiplexes\", to be launched over time. The government initially announced the channels that would be included in the first multiplex (Channel One, Rossiya 1, Rossiya 2, Rossiya 24, Rossiya K, Channel 5, NTV, Karousel, TVC and Public TV of Russia (OTR)), determined milestones for the transition to this multiplex, and indicated that the infrastructure for this first multiplex will be funded by the government.\nIn December 2012, the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecommunications, Information Technologies and Mass Communications (Roskomnadzor) announced the 10 channels selected following a tender for inclusion in a second multiplex including our CTC and Domashny channels. It is expected that the second multiplex will ultimately be available to approximately 98% of the Russian population. The success of the transition to digital broadcasting may\nbe limited if Russian television viewers do not purchase new digital televisions or set-top boxes, particularly in light of the current challenging economic environment.\nIn March 2013, we entered into 10-year transmission agreements with RTRS. Under the terms of these agreements, RTRS will ultimately provide to CTC and Domashny, as well as other broadcasters in the second multiplex, all services required for the channels to broadcast their signals in digital format throughout Russia to more than approximately 140 million viewers, once the rollout of digital broadcasting is complete throughout the territory of the Russian Federation. In July 2014, we amended these agreements with RTRS to better reflect the currently planned rollout schedule and to amend the financial terms of participation in the second multiplex in light of RTRS's current implementation timeframes, the funds needed to provide services in regions as they become operational, and the financial support required for the build-out of the infrastructure for a comprehensive digital platform throughout the Russian Federation by 2018. RTRS is initially launching digital broadcast services in the second multiplex in cities with populations of more than 50,000 people (\"50+ coverage\"). In addition, during the period 2015-2018, RTRS will construct the digital broadcasting infrastructure in smaller cities with populations less than 50,000 (\"50- coverage\"). It is expected that this infrastructure will be put into operation in 2019. See also \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Transition to digital broadcasting\".\nFollowing the introduction of digital broadcasting, we expect to encounter certain risks and uncertainties in the execution of each of our channels' business models. Currently, we believe the most significant of these are the following:\n\u2022 The anticipated transition to digital broadcasting may affect the relative position of broadcasters within the television marketplace, which may negatively impact the audience shares of our channels.\n\u2022 Viewers may not acquire television-sets or converters that will allow them to receive the digital signal prior to the time analog broadcasting ends.\n\u2022 We cannot guarantee that our Peretz channel will be able to compete effectively if it is not included in the third multiplex, for which the requirements for inclusion have not yet been announced.\n\u2022 Further, viewers may switch to cable television. In the absence of 'must-carry' obligations for cable operators, this could lead to a decline in the overall number of households viewing free-to-air television and, as a result, our viewer ratings.\nIn December 2014, a draft law containing amendments to the Mass media law was submitted to the State's Duma, providing obligation of cable operators to carry signal of channels included in multiplex (which would be applicable for our CTC and Domashny channels). If this law is not adopted, we may be unable to secure or maintain carriage of CTC and Domashny channels' signals over cable in certain regions, or at transmission rates that are consistent with our historical experience. With respect to our Peretz channel which is not included in multiplex, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate mutually acceptable transmission agreements in the future relating to the carriage of our signals with cable providers.\n\u2022 We expect to continue to incur analog transmission costs during the analog-to-digital transition period. In 2014, we incurred an aggregate of $24 million of such expenses for all of our channels. According to the amended agreements with RTRS, our digital transmission expense for 2014 related to broadcasting in cities with populations more than 50,000 (\"50+ coverage\") amounted to $3.0 million and will be approximately $4.4 million in 2015 for our CTC and Domashny channels in aggregate.\nIn addition, we expect to make advance payments towards the construction of the digital infrastructure in smaller cities with populations less than 50,000 (\"50- coverage\"). In aggregate we expect to advance approximately 1,034 million rubles or $18.4 million by the end of 2018 (at an exchange rate of RUR 56.3 to $1.00 as of December 31, 2014). Under the amended terms, these advances will be offset against service payments otherwise required for digital transmission services subsequent to 2018. In 2014, we made advance payments towards the construction of the digital infrastructure in the 50- coverage regions of approximately 390 million rubles or $6.9 million for CTC and Domashny channels in aggregate (at an exchange rate of RUR 56.3 to $1.00 as of December 31, 2014). The increased revenues from higher anticipated geographical penetration from digital broadcasting may not sufficiently compensate for increased costs associated with transmission and broadcast equipment upgrades.\n\u2022 There may be other unanticipated risks and expenses that we encounter during the transition and subsequently that could be material to our future financial position and results of operations.\nWhile our channels will continue to broadcast in the analog format under existing analog licenses, there is currently uncertainty regarding the effect of the implementation of digital broadcasting on our business models, and the digitalization of broadcasting may adversely affect our market position and financial condition.\nSeveral recently adopted Russian and Kazakh laws regarding advertising and programming content may impact the programming and advertisements we are permitted to broadcast, which could result in a reduction in our audience share and advertising revenues.\nOn July 4, 2014, the Russian Parliament adopted three laws amending the Advertising Law. One of the amendments eliminates the existing restriction that prohibits an advertising sales house having a greater than 35% share of the TV advertising market. The amendment came into force on July 22, 2014. In 2011, when this restriction came into force, we formed our own sales house-EvereST-S-and terminated our sales agency agreement with Video International, which had historically served as our sales house and which then had a share of the Russian TV advertising market greater than 35%. We continue to rely on Video International for material software and consulting services. On October 3, 2014, the four largest television groups in Russia, Gazprom Media, VGTRK, Channel One and National Media Group, together with the management of Video International, announced the formation of a new advertising sales house to operate under the Vi brand. Although subsequent press reports indicate that this plan will not proceed, we are unable to predict whether some combination of external sales houses may be effected in the future, or the potential impact of any such combination on the broader advertising market in Russia or impact our ability to obtain necessary support for our internal sales house. These developments may also adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with Vi when our current agreements expire at the end of 2015 or may otherwise adversely affect our position in the broader advertising market.\nA second amendment removes the prohibition on advertising by beer producers and their brands during the broadcasting of sporting events. The amendment came into force on July 22, 2014. Currently, our channels do not broadcast sporting events and we therefore do not expect that this amendment will affect our current operations, although our Peretz channel may decide to broadcast sporting events in the future.\nIn February 2015, the President of Russia signed amendments to the Advertising Law that will permit pay-TV channels that broadcast more than 75% Russian content to sell advertising. We do not believe that such amendments will affect our operations.\nThe law \"On protection of children from harmful information\", which came into effect in September 2012, prohibits the distribution of any information that may be harmful to children, such as scenes of\nviolence, abusive language, pornography and scenes encouraging children to consume alcohol, drugs and tobacco. All information must be labeled into five categories: (1) information appropriate for children under 6 years, (2) information appropriate for children 6 years and older, (3) information appropriate for children 12 years and older, (4) information appropriate for children 16 years and older, and (5) information prohibited for children. In order to comply with this new law, we have established an editorial control department responsible for labeling our programs in accordance with these five categories. Since September 2012 all our programs have been labeled in accordance with this new law. Implementation of this law has not adversely affected our channels to date, but we can provide no assurance that governmental authorities will not in the future interpret the law in such a way that will require us to revise our programming, which could adversely impact the audience share of our channels.\nIn April 2013, a new law came into force amending the federal law \"Improving Regulation of Mass Media, Television and Radio Broadcasting\" as well as the Administrative Code, prohibiting the use of abusive language in mass media. We believe that these amendments will not affect our channels as long as we constantly monitor our content, but since the term \"abusive language\" is not defined and is subject to interpretation, we cannot guarantee that we will not be faced with claims that we have violated this law or that we will be able to defend these claims successfully.\nIn October 2013, a new law came into force amending the law on advertising as well as the Administrative Code regulating the advertising of biologically active additives (BAA) and imposing penalties for inappropriate advertising thereof. According to this law, advertisements must include a disclaimer that BAAs are not a medicine. Advertisers as well as television channels broadcasting such BAA advertisements will be liable if such a disclaimer is not included or does not satisfy these new requirements. We do not expect this law to affect our business significantly, since we have editorial control over commercials we broadcast, but we cannot be sure that we will not receive any claims in the future, since there is limited legal practice in implementing these amendments and there are no court interpretations of them.\nIn Kazakhstan, a new amendment to the Kazakh Law \"On advertising\" came into force on July 13, 2014. This amendment prohibits advertising umbrella brands of alcohol producers. We do not expect this law to affect our business significantly. In addition, increased competition from cable channels due to government initiatives to air at least 50% of TV programing in the Kazakh language (during every six-hour slot) by free-to-air channels may affect our Kazakh operations.\nChanges in the method of measuring television audiences and ratings have at times in the past resulted, and may again in the future result, in decreases in our audience share and ratings.\nOur advertising revenues are largely driven by our audience share (the percentage of all people watching television at a given time who are watching our channels) and ratings (the percentage of the total population that is watching our channels at a given time). The system of audience measurement in Russia, currently run by TNS Russia, has evolved as the advertising market has matured and in response to changing Russian demographics.\nTNS Russia currently weights the panel of measured cities based on broadcasters' technical penetration in a group of 165 cities (the so-called \"establishment survey\"). The panel cities are chosen from among those Russian cities with more than 100,000 residents, which together account for approximately 50% of the total population of Russia. Our audience share could be negatively affected if we were to lose an affiliate in one of the cities in that group, or if our technical penetration in that group of cities were to be lower than our average technical penetration.\nAt the end of 2012, the government published the results of the Russian population census taken at the end of 2010. These results led to changes to the relative weighting of the cities in the panel, the size of which increased to 77 cities starting January 1, 2013. Furthermore, in 2013 TNS expanded the \"establishment survey\" from 121 cities to all cities with more than 100,000 residents (165 cities in\ntotal). According to our estimates, such change did not lead to any significant changes in the weighting system or have any impact on our estimated ratings.\nIn addition, on June 30, 2014, the Industry Committee on TV Audience Measurement in Russia announced a tender for the right to provide the industry-standard measurement of TV audiences in Russia for the period from 2017 through 2026. We understand that in October 2014, four companies, including TNS, submitted applications in response to this tender, but the tender was not held in the fourth quarter of 2014 as was previously announced. There is no public information as to whether this tender will be held or when, but in the event that it is held it may result in a change in the provider of audience measurement services in Russia, or may in any event result in changes in the audience measurement system. We are unable to predict at this time the impact of any such changes on our audience share or ratings, but any such changes may adversely affect our audience shares.\nWe are also unable to predict how the audience measurement system may change as and when digital broadcasting is rolled out throughout Russia.\nWhen changes to the system of audience measurement occur, we attempt to take steps when possible in respect of our programming, distribution and sales to counteract the effects of such changes. We cannot assure you that these steps will be adequate or effective, or that any further changes in the measurement system will not result in decreases in our estimated audience shares and, as a result, a material decrease in our advertising revenues.\nRestrictions on foreign involvement in the television business in Kazakhstan could be amended or interpreted in such a way as to result in our loss of necessary licenses or to require us to divest control of our Kazakh operating subsidiaries.\nThe Mass Media Law in Kazakhstan restricts direct and indirect foreign ownership of any Kazakh television broadcaster to no more than 20%. In 2008, we acquired a 20% interest in the Kazakh television broadcast company Channel 31, and established two subsidiaries that provide the programming content and advertising sales functions to Channel 31 on an exclusive basis (together, the \"Channel 31 Group\"). Together, these interests provide us with a 60% economic interest in the Channel 31 Group as a whole. If the existing 20% limit were to be interpreted to restrict effective or economic control, rather than just direct ownership, or if the law were to be changed or interpreted to impose further restrictions or limitations on foreign ownership of Kazakh television broadcasters, we could be obliged to restructure this group in order to comply with such requirements or could be required to divest all or a portion of our interest in the Channel 31 Group. If we fail to comply in a timely manner, the authorities could suspend or revoke Channel 31's broadcasting licenses or could take other actions that could limit our ability to operate the Channel 31 Group. The book value of Channel 31's broadcasting license as at December 31, 2014, was approximately $4.2 million.\nWe may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses, and if we fail to identify additional suitable targets our growth may be impeded.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that we believe are commercially attractive. While acquisitions represent an important component of our growth strategy, the integration of new businesses poses significant risks to our existing operations, including:\n\u2022 additional and significant demands placed on our senior management, who are also responsible for managing our existing operations;\n\u2022 increased overall operating complexity of our business, requiring greater personnel and other resources;\n\u2022 difficulties of expanding beyond our core expertise;\n\u2022 significant initial cash expenditures to acquire and integrate new businesses;\n\u2022 contingent liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 incurrence of debt to finance acquisitions and high debt service costs related thereto.\nAdditionally, the integration of new businesses may be difficult for a variety of reasons, including differing cultures or management styles, legal restrictions in the target's jurisdiction, poor target records or internal controls and an inability to establish control over cash flows. Furthermore, even if we are successful in integrating new businesses, expected synergies and cost savings may not materialize, resulting in lower than expected profit margins.\nAs a US public company, we are subject to securities laws and regulations requiring that we file with the SEC audited historical financial statements for businesses we acquire that exceed certain materiality thresholds. Given the financial reporting practices in Russia and other CIS countries, such financial statements are often not readily available or are not capable of being audited to the standards required by US securities regulations. As a result, we may be prevented from pursuing acquisition opportunities that our competitors and other financial and strategic investors are able to pursue.\nA change in Russian law further limiting the amount of advertising time permitted on television could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrent Russian law limits the amount of time that a broadcaster may devote to advertising to no more than 15% of any broadcasting hour. From time to time, there are discussions in the Russian government regarding imposing additional restrictions on television advertising, such as limiting the types of products that may be advertised, limiting product placements in programming, limiting the number of advertising breaks allowed in certain programs or requiring channels to devote more broadcast time to public service announcements. If legislation were introduced to further limit our ability to broadcast paid advertising or product placements, we cannot guarantee that increases in advertising prices, if any, or any other steps we would be able to take to mitigate the impact of such further limitation would be sufficient to compensate for the loss of advertising time.\nIf free-to-air television does not continue to constitute a significant advertising forum in Russia, our revenues could be materially reduced.\nWe generate substantially all our revenues from the sale of television advertising in Russia, which constituted approximately half of all advertising expenditures in Russia in 2014, having increased from 25% in 1999. In the broader advertising market, television competes with various other advertising media, such as print, radio, internet and outdoor advertising. In addition, the television broadcasting industry is affected by rapid innovations in technology. The implementation of new technologies and the introduction of broadcasting distribution systems other than free-to-air broadcasting, such as direct-to-home cable and satellite distribution systems, the internet, video-on-demand, user-generated content sites and the availability of television programming on portable digital devices, are changing consumer behavior by increasing the number of entertainment choices available to the audience. While television continues to constitute the single largest component of all advertising spending in Russia, there can be no assurance that television will maintain its current position among advertising media. Increases in competition arising from the development of new forms of advertising media could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and develop our advertising revenues and, as a result, on our results of operations.\nThe loss of licenses, or the failure to comply with the terms of licenses, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAll broadcast television stations in Russia are required to have broadcasting and other operating licenses. Only a limited number of such licenses are available in each locality. These licenses currently\nhave a standard term of ten years. We also hold so-called \"universal licenses\", which permit a channel to broadcast through free-to-air, cable and satellite broadcasting, in either digital or analog format across the whole territory of Russia. However, we anticipate that analog licenses will be relevant until the full transition to digital broadcasting is complete.\nIn addition, Russian law could be interpreted as requiring cable television operators to have broadcast and other operating licenses for each of the channels or networks they transmit on their cable systems. Most of the independent cable television operators that currently carry our networks do not possess such licenses. The issuance of a license, as well as the terms and conditions of any license, are often subject to the exercise of broad discretion by governmental authorities.\nA broadcaster must conform its programming to the programming concept outlined in the broadcasting license. In particular, the broadcaster is obliged to ensure compliance of its programming with the declared genres of the channel and to maintain a required balance in the volume-genre ratio of broadcasted materials, both of which are prescribed in the license. Until recently, the broadcasting licenses of our affiliate stations also contained various restrictions, including requirements with respect to the minimum amount of locally produced programming that must be broadcasted.\nThe broadcasting license of Channel 31 in Kazakhstan also contains various restrictions and obligations. Kazakh law currently requires that broadcasters air at least 50% of their programming in the Kazakh language during every six-hour slot.\nWe may not always be in full compliance with license requirements. Also, our affiliates have not always been in full compliance with all the requirements of their licenses or obtained all the licenses necessary for broadcasting. If the terms of a license are not complied with, or if we violate applicable legislation or regulations, the license may be suspended or terminated (which decision may be appealed in court). If an affiliate were to broadcast without all the necessary licenses, broadcasting may be terminated and fines could be imposed.\nThe loss of an existing broadcasting license, or the failure to obtain a broadcasting license in a new market, particularly in a significant market, could reduce or limit the coverage of our networks and result in a loss of audience share and a fall in ratings, which could materially adversely affect our advertising revenues and business.\nSee also \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\"\nThe failure of our independent affiliates to comply with requirements in our network agreements that they broadcast our advertising creates the potential for complaints from our advertising clients.\nWe seek to enter into formal agreements with our independent affiliate stations governing various aspects of the broadcast of our network programming. These agreements generally require our affiliates to air most of our programming, including advertising during federal advertising slots. The majority of our independent affiliate stations have their own broadcasting licenses which entitle them to form their own broadcasting grid structured in accordance with their licenses as well as our network agreements.\nAlthough we have introduced procedures to monitor the broadcasting of our network programming in cities that have not been included in TNS Russia Panel, we cannot ensure that our affiliates are always consistent in their compliance with the federal advertising provisions of our agreements. If an independent affiliate breaches its obligations under our network agreement, we may face complaints from our advertising clients.\nThe loss of independent affiliates could result in a loss of audience share.\nWe seek to enter into formal agreements with our independent affiliate stations that govern various aspects of the broadcast of our network programming. These agreements generally provide each party with the right to terminate the agreement on 60 or 90 days' notice without penalty. If an independent affiliate in a larger market, particularly in a city where audiences are measured and in which we do not own and operate a station, were to terminate its agreement with us, sell itself to a competing network or lose the ability to broadcast our signal, it could result in a decrease in our audience share.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with re-transmission capabilities in certain locations, and our business would be adversely affected if such parties terminated or adversely changed the terms of those relationships.\nIn certain locations, we depend on cable operators or other third parties to carry our signal. If we were to be denied continued access to the cable systems or other third parties that carry our networks' signals, our technical penetration could be materially adversely affected which would, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our audience shares. Depending on the exact terms of the transition to digital broadcasting, our dependence on cable operators may increase.\nCurrent Russian legislation does not provide 'must carry' obligations for cable operators. On December 19, 2014 a draft law containing amendments to the Mass Media Law and the Law On Communications providing 'must carry' obligations for cable operators was submitted by the Russian government to the Russian State Duma; this proposal is currently under analysis and discussion by a Duma committee. The initial draft of the law provides for the obligation of cable operators to carry the signals of channels included in the digital multiplexes (which would be applicable for our CTC and Domashny channels), as well as two regional and one local channels. If this law is not adopted, we may be unable to secure or maintain carriage of our CTC and Domashny channels' signals over cable in certain regions, or at transmission rates that are consistent with our historical experience. With respect to our Peretz channel, which is not included in the second multiplex, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate mutually acceptable transmission agreements in the future relating to the carriage of our signals with cable providers.\nWe rely on third parties for the production of a significant portion of our original Russian programming, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to continue such relationships on acceptable terms.\nWe rely on third-party production houses to produce a significant portion of our original programs. If we are unable to continue our close working relationships with the production houses we use or to develop new relationships, our ability to air premium new Russian content may be impeded, which would likely result in a loss of audience share and therefore a reduction in our share of the television advertising market.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against other free-to-air channels and networks that may have broader coverage, greater name recognition, larger market share, wider programming content or access to more funding than we do, or with niche channels or non-free-to-air channels offering competitive programming formats.\nThe Russian television broadcasting business is highly competitive. Approximately 20 free-to-air television channels account for approximately 98% of the television advertising market. The market also includes multiple non-free-to-air television channels. The free-to-air channels include five larger national channels, namely Channel One, Rossiya 1, NTV, TNT and CTC, and a number of smaller niche channels, including Domashny and Peretz. Our networks compete for audience share with other national television networks and channels and with local stations, as well as with niche broadcasters. We\ncompete on the basis of both the actual and anticipated size of our audiences for specific time slots, as well as the demographic characteristics of our viewers.\nOn a national level, CTC competes directly with other larger broadcast networks and channels, including Channel One, as well as with the smaller networks, TNT and NTV. Domashny competes for advertising revenues primarily with Rossiya 1 and TVC, and Peretz competes primarily with NTV and REN-TV, although they both also compete with the larger broadcast networks and channels for viewers within their target demographic groups. On a local level, our owned-and-operated stations compete with other stations for local advertising.\nChannel One and Rossiya 1 were established as state television channels during the Soviet period and they remain under Russian state control. As a result, we understand that these channels receive state benefits not generally available to private companies, including free signal transmission (in the case of Channel One), direct state budget subsidies (in the case of Rossiya 1) and preferences in licensing. The provision of benefits and preferences to state controlled entities may impede our ability, as a private media company, to effectively operate and compete in the broadcasting market given the trend towards market consolidation by state controlled entities. For example, Gazprom, the state-controlled energy company, expanded its Russian media holding further in November 2013 by the acquisition of Profmedia which operates TV and radio stations as well as other media assets.\nMoreover, nearly every viewing household in Russia can receive the broadcast signals of Channel One and Rossiya 1, while only a more limited viewing audience can currently receive our network signals. The much broader coverage and name recognition of Channel One and Rossiya 1, coupled with programming geared toward a broader demographic group, help them to attract large audience shares. NTV, which is indirectly controlled by the state through Gazprom, also has a broader coverage than our networks, and we believe also benefits from free signal transmission. In 2014, Channel One had an average audience share among 10-45 year-old viewers of 12.1%, while Rossiya 1's was 8.3% and NTV's was 7.8%. CTC's average target audience share in 2014 was 10.2%. We believe that the strong audience shares of Channel One, Rossiya 1 and NTV may give these broadcasters added leverage in negotiations with advertisers, advertising agencies and sales houses. Moreover, as we focus on entertainment programming, we are unable to compete with other broadcasters for audiences for news and sporting programs, some of which have among the highest audience shares and ratings in their time slots. In addition, Channel One, Rossiya 1 and NTV may enjoy certain preferences that commercial channels do not. For example, they are included in the list of free-access federal channels that benefit from a must-carry option throughout Russia, as opposed to commercial channels including ours, which have to pay for transmission services.\nWe understand that the beneficial owners of one of our principal minority stockholders, Telcrest, including Bank Rossiya (which is not affiliated with Rossiya television channel), have investments in Russian media businesses, including through ownership interests in Channel One, REN-TV and Channel 5. Telcrest and Bank Rossiya may have interests different from, or in addition to, the interests of other stockholders of CTC Media. See also \"-Our principal stockholders may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other stockholders of CTC Media.\"\nNon-free-to-air channels typically provide services to subscribers for a regular subscription fee, and typically do not generate a significant portion of their revenues from advertising. As a percentage of the overall television market, the non-free-to-air market in Russia is currently smaller than in the United States and Western European countries. Audience share for these channels, however, is increasing. In other countries, such as the United States, growth in non-free-to-air television services has often resulted in fragmentation of the market and a corresponding decrease in the audience share of large national networks and channels. All larger national free-to-air TV channels in Russia have in recent periods been negatively impacted by increased competition from non-free- to-air and smaller niche TV channel viewership in the \"All 4+\" category, which increased from 12.6% in 2010 to 14.5% in\n2011, 15.5% in 2012, 17.2% in 2013 and 18.4% in 2014. If smaller niche and non- free-to-air channels continue to grow their customer base in Russia, our audience shares and ratings, especially the audience share of CTC channel, could be negatively affected, which would adversely affect our advertising revenues. See also \"-If free-to-air television does not continue to constitute a significant advertising forum in Russia, our revenues could be materially reduced\".\nAlso, the introduction of digital broadcasting may affect competition within the television marketplace, which may negatively impact the audience shares of our channels. See also \"-We face additional expenditures in connection with the planned transition from analog to digital broadcasting in Russia and Kazakhstan and the necessary investments for digital migration may not be fully monetized\".\nWe have substantial future programming commitments that we may not be able to vary in response to a decline in advertising revenues, and as a result could experience material reductions in operating margins.\nProgramming represents our most significant expense, and at any given time we generally have substantial fixed commitments for the succeeding two to three years. For example, as of December 31, 2014 we had contractual commitments for the acquisition of approximately $110.3 million in programming rights in 2015, $17.2 million in 2016 and $0.2 million in 2017, including US dollar denominated commitments of approximately $47.3 million in 2015, $12.2 million in 2016 and $0.2 million in 2017.\nGiven the size of these commitments, at any time a reduction in our advertising revenues could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. See also-\"Decreases in the value of the Russian ruble as compared to the US dollar that have resulted from the current economic and political instability in Russia have negatively impacted our reported revenues and operating results. If the exchange rate between the ruble and the US dollar remains at its current level or if the ruble depreciates further, our revenues and our operating results, both as reported in US dollars, may continue to be negatively affected\".\nOur relationships with the co-owners of our television stations may limit our ability to implement our business plans and strategy.\nMore than half of our owned-and-operated stations are 100% owned by CTC Media. Other shareholders own between less than 1% and 50% of each of the remaining owned-and-operated stations. In some cases, we depend to a significant extent on our local partners for their familiarity with the local business environment and public authorities. Moreover, we may in the future similarly rely on joint-owners as we acquire additional stations. Any significant disruption in our relationship with these parties could make it more difficult for us to operate these stations.\nRussian law and some of the agreements governing these stations grant protective rights to our co-owners that enable them to block certain significant corporate actions. Under Russian company law, significant corporate decisions, such as declaring and paying dividends and entering into substantial transactions, require the consent of the holders of two-thirds or three- quarters of the voting interests of the company, depending on the subject matter and the legal structure of the company. In addition, unanimous shareholder approval is required in limited instances, which could further affect our control over certain actions. For example, approval of a joint stock company's initial charter and reorganization of a joint stock company into a non- commercial partnership require 100% approval of shareholders. In the case of a limited liability company, increases in charter capital, amendments to a limited liability company's charter, and liquidation, among other actions, require 100% approval of the holders of participation interests.\nAs a result, we are often required to obtain the consent of our co-owners when making significant corporate decisions. Although we are not aware of any specific transaction in which we failed to obtain\nthe requisite approval of the co-owners of our stations, due to the formalistic nature of Russian law and the large number of corporate actions that are taken annually by our co- owned stations, we believe it is likely that, from time to time, not all necessary minority shareholder consents have been obtained. As a result, we cannot guarantee that co-owners of our stations will not bring claims against us for failure to obtain these necessary consents, which, if successful, could result in the transaction in question being voided. Moreover, even if not technically required by law or contract, we generally prefer to obtain the consent and support of our co-owners before undertaking significant corporate actions. If this consent cannot be obtained, we may decide to forego a transaction that is commercially favorable to us in an effort to preserve goodwill with our co-owners.\nWe hold a 20% interest in Channel 31 in Kazakhstan and majority interests in two other companies that provide the programming content and advertising sales functions to Channel 31 on an exclusive basis, giving us a 60% economic interest in the Channel 31 Group as a whole. Pursuant to the provisions of Kazakh company law, our co-owners of the Channel 31 group companies may block certain significant corporate actions, which may limit our flexibility in managing these operations.\nLoss of key personnel could affect our growth and future success.\nWe believe that our growth and our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled senior management, production talent, finance and legal personnel. The competition is intense in Russia for qualified personnel who are familiar with the Russian television industry and/or who are knowledgeable about US accounting and legal practices. In January 2015, our CFO Nikolay Surikov resigned and was replaced by Stanislav Ploschenko. Our Chief Content Officer and Head of CTC Channel Vyacheslav Murugov tendered his resignation in November 2014. Following resignation of Vyacheslav Murugov, Elmira Makhmutova was appointed Head of CTC Channel. In December 2014, Ruben Oganesyan was appointed as Head of Peretz channel. The competition is intense in Russia for qualified personnel who are familiar with the Russian television industry and/or who are knowledgeable about US accounting and legal practices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain qualified personnel, or hire appropriate replacements on reasonable terms or at all.\nA broadcasting systems failure could prevent us from transmitting our network signal and lead to a loss of viewers, damage to our reputation and a reduction in our advertising revenues.\nOur networks' signals originate in Moscow and are uplinked to multiple separate satellite systems that transmit our signals to our affiliate stations and unmanned repeater transmitters. From time to time we experience insignificant signal failures. Although we are able to backup our signal, prolonged or repeated disruptions in our signals could lead to a loss of viewers, damage to our reputation and a reduction in our advertising revenues. We do not carry business interruption insurance to protect us in the event of a catastrophe or termination of our ability to transmit our signals, even though such an event could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nWe do not carry all of the insurance coverage customary in many countries for a business of our size and nature, and as a result could experience substantial loss or disruption.\nThe insurance industry is less developed in Russia than in other developed countries, and many forms of insurance protection common in other countries are not yet available in Russia on comparable terms. Although we have insurance covering risks of loss of satellite signal and satellite capacity, at present, we have no coverage for business interruption or loss of key management personnel. We do not maintain separate funds or otherwise set aside reserves for these types of losses. Any such loss may cause substantial disruption and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may from time to time be involved in lawsuits and investigations that could entail significant costs and, if determined against us, could require us to pay substantial damages, fines and/or penalties.\nIn the normal course of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings. These lawsuits and other proceedings include commercial disputes, claims regarding intellectual property, tax disputes and labor disputes. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. If a lawsuit is decided in a way that is unfavorable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, or financial condition.\nAs a publicly listed company, we may be exposed to lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that CTC Media or our directors or officers failed to comply with applicable securities laws, stock market regulations or other laws, regulations or requirements. Whether or not there is merit to such claims, the time and costs incurred in defending our company and its directors or officers, and any potential settlement or compensation we might be obligated to pay the plaintiffs, could have a significant impact on our reported results, as well as our reputation.\nSee also \"Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\"\nOur principal stockholders may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other stockholders of CTC Media.\nEach of our two largest stockholders, which together hold approximately 64% of our common stock, is involved in the television business in Russia.\nMTG Russia AB, an affiliate of the publicly listed Modern Times Group MTG AB (\"MTG\"), holds a 50% interest in Raduga Holdings. Raduga is the sole owner of LCC DalGeoCom, which operates Raduga TV, a nationwide Russian digital satellite pay-TV platform. J\u00f8rgen Madsen Lindemann, a member of the Board of MTG, is a Co-Chairman of our board of directors; Mathias Hermansson, CFO of MTG, and Irina Gofman, Chief Executive Officer of MTG Russia AB, are members of our board of directors. Although we do not currently operate in the pay-TV market, and do not currently compete with or have any commercial relationship with Raduga TV, MTG may have interests that are different from or in addition to interests of other stockholders of CTC Media, including as a result of its interest in another Russian television business.\nWe understand that the beneficial owners of our second largest shareholder Telcrest, including Bank Rossiya, have investments in Russian media businesses, including through indirect minority equity interests in Channel One, REN-TV and TRK 5 (Channel 5). We understand that Bank Rossiya also has indirect significant minority interests in Video International, with which we have software license and service agreements in respect of advertising sales.\nPursuant to a stockholders agreement, Telcrest has designated three of our directors, none of whom we understand is currently primarily engaged in the operations of Channel One, REN-TV, TRK 5 or Video International. We compete with broadcasters in which the beneficial owners of Telcrest have equity and financial interests, and we believe the services of Video International are important to our operations. Although we are not aware of any conflicts of interest with Telcrest in this regard, Telcrest and its beneficial owners may have interests that are different from or in addition to interests of other stockholders of CTC Media.\nSee also \"-The current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations, and may require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts\" and\n\"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock\".\nRisks relating to doing business and investing in Russia\nSee also \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\"\nThe Russian banking system remains underdeveloped, and another banking crisis could place severe liquidity constraints on our business.\nRussia's banking and other financial systems are less developed and regulated than those of many other developed countries, and Russian legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application. Many Russian banks do not meet international banking standards, and the transparency of the Russian banking sector still lags far behind internationally accepted norms. Furthermore, Russian bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured. Moreover, the sector specific sanctions on certain Russian banks recently introduced by United States and European Union have negatively affected the Russian banking system.\nThere are currently a limited number of creditworthy Russian banks, most of which are located in Moscow and the largest of which are state-owned. We generally hold a large majority of our cash balance in Russian banks, including the Russian subsidiaries of foreign banks. Of that balance, a significant portion is held in ruble-denominated accounts. There are few, if any, safe ruble-denominated instruments in which we may invest our excess ruble cash. A banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the banks from which we receive or with which we hold our funds could result in the loss of our deposits or affect our ability to complete banking transactions in Russia, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nSee also \"-Geopolitical and macroeconomic events have adversely affected and created uncertainty and instability in the Russian economy.\"\nBusinesses in Russia can be subject to politically motivated actions, which could materially adversely affect our operations.\nThe Russian government has taken various actions in past years against business people and companies operating in Russia that have been perceived as having been politically motivated, including actions for technical violations of law or violations of laws that have been applied retroactively, including violations of tax laws. These actions have on occasion resulted in significant fluctuations in the market prices of the securities of businesses operating in Russia, a weakening of investor confidence in Russia and doubts about the progress of market and political reforms in Russia. For example, the Russian state has recently won legal proceedings against AFK Sistema concerning the acquisition of its controlling stake in OAO Bashneft during 2005 to 2009. The state expropriated Sistema's interest in the regional oil producer on the grounds that it had been privatized without state consent. The risk of similar claims, which may be perceived as being politically motivated, against Russian companies and/or companies operating in the Russian market has created uncertainty and instability which may inhibit our ability to operate and exert downward pressure on our stock price.\nMedia businesses can be particularly vulnerable to politically motivated actions. We believe that our focus on entertainment, and the fact that we broadcast entertainment and celebrity news, but do not offer \"hard\" news, commentary or analysis on our national networks, could lessen the risk of\nprovoking politically motivated actions. However, we do not restrict the ability of our independent affiliates to broadcast local news in local broadcasting windows, and some of our independent affiliates, as well as one of our owned-and-operated CTC stations, broadcast local political news, generally with the approval of our local partners and the local authorities. Any politically motivated action against us, our networks, our independent affiliates, or any of our principal stockholders, including the beneficial owners of MTG or Telcrest, could materially adversely affect our operations. See also \"-The current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations, and may require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts\" and \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\"\nThe Russian legal system can create an uncertain environment for investment and business activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe legal framework to support a market economy remains new and in flux in Russia and, as a result, the Russian legal system can be characterized by:\n\u2022 inconsistencies between and among laws and governmental, ministerial and local regulations, orders, decisions, resolutions and other acts;\n\u2022 substantial gaps in the regulatory structure resulting from the delay in adoption or absence of implementing regulations;\n\u2022 limited judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting Russian legislation;\n\u2022 the relative inexperience of judges and courts in interpreting relatively new commercial legislation;\n\u2022 a lack of judicial independence from political, social and commercial forces;\n\u2022 under-funding and under-staffing of the court system;\n\u2022 a high degree of discretion on the part of the judiciary and governmental authorities; and\n\u2022 poorly developed bankruptcy procedures that are subject to abuse.\nAs is true of civil law systems, judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions. Not all Russian legislation and court decisions are readily available to the public or organized in a manner that facilitates understanding. The Russian judicial system can be slow, and enforcement of court orders can in practice be very difficult. All of these factors make judicial decisions in Russia difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain. Additionally, court claims and governmental prosecutions are sometimes used in furtherance of political aims.\nIn February 2014, a new law came into force amending the Russian Constitution and merging the Higher Arbitration court with the Higher Court, creating a new Higher Court. As of the date of this Annual Report, the new Higher Court is in the process of being established. We cannot predict the effect of this merger on judicial practice and the Russian judicial system.\nThe untested nature of much of recent Russian legislation and the rapid evolution of the Russian legal system in ways that may not always coincide with market developments may result in ambiguities, inconsistencies and anomalies in the Russian legal system. Such uncertainties in the Russian legal system could affect our ability to enforce our rights under our licenses and under our contracts, or to defend ourselves against claims by others, including government authorities. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that regulators, judicial authorities or third parties will not challenge our compliance with applicable laws, decrees and regulations.\nSee also \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock\".\nSelective or arbitrary government action may have an adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.\nGovernment authorities have a high degree of discretion in Russia and have at times exercised their discretion selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is influenced by political or commercial considerations. The government also has the power, in certain circumstances, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Selective or arbitrary actions have included withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have also used common defects in documentation as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate and/or to void transactions, apparently for political purposes. We cannot assure you that regulators, judicial authorities or third parties will not challenge our compliance (including that of our subsidiaries) with applicable laws, decrees and regulations in Russia. Selective or arbitrary government action could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the value of our common stock. See also \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock.\"\nIf the Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service were to conclude that we acquired or created a new company in contravention of anti-monopoly legislation, it could impose fines or administrative penalties and could require the divestiture of such company or other assets.\nOur business has grown in part through the acquisition and establishment of companies, many of which transactions required the prior approval of, or subsequent notification to, the Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service or its predecessor agencies (the \"FAS\"). The relevant legislation restricts the acquisition or establishment of companies by groups of companies or individuals acting in concert without the required approval or notification. This legislation is vague in parts and subject to varying interpretations. If the FAS were to conclude that an acquisition or establishment of a new company had been effected in contravention of applicable legislation and competition has been reduced as a result, it could impose administrative penalties and require the divestiture of such company or other assets, adversely affecting our business strategy and our results of operations.\nIf one of our principal subsidiaries is forced into liquidation due to negative net assets, our results of operations could suffer.\nIf at the end of any fiscal year a Russian company's net assets as determined in accordance with Russian accounting regulations are below the minimum amount of charter capital required by Russian law, the company is required to convene a shareholders meeting to adopt a decision to liquidate. If it fails to do so within a \"reasonable period,\" the company's creditors may request early termination or acceleration of the company's obligations to them, as well as damages, and governmental authorities may seek to cause the involuntary liquidation of the company. It is unclear under Russian law whether a historical violation of this requirement may be retroactively cured, even if a company later comes into compliance with the requirement. On occasion, Russian courts have ordered the involuntary liquidation of a company for having negative net assets even if the company has continued to fulfill its obligations and had net assets in excess of the minimum amount at the time of liquidation.\nCertain of our regional subsidiaries have had, and continue to have, negative equity as reported in their respective Russian statutory financial statements. None of these companies has applied for voluntary liquidation. We are currently taking steps to remedy the negative net asset value of these subsidiaries, but we have not included it as a contingency in our financial statements because we believe that, so long as these subsidiaries continue to fulfill their obligations, the risk of their forced liquidation is remote.\nThere has been no judicial or other official interpretation of what constitutes a \"reasonable period\" within which a company must act to liquidate. If any of our subsidiaries were to be liquidated involuntarily, we would be forced to reorganize the operations we currently conduct through that subsidiary. The liquidation of any of our owned-and-operated station subsidiaries would result in the termination of their existing broadcast and other licenses, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to secure new licenses needed for these stations to continue to operate. Accordingly, any liquidation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRussian law requires the approval of certain transactions by the minority shareholders of our subsidiaries, including several of our owned-and-operated television stations, and failure to receive this approval could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe own less than 100% of many of our owned-and-operated stations. Under Russian law, certain transactions defined as \"interested party transactions\" require approval by disinterested members of the board of directors or disinterested shareholders of the companies involved. Our owned-and- operated stations that have other shareholders engage in numerous transactions with us that require interested party transaction approvals in accordance with Russian law. Due to the formalistic nature of much of Russian law, these transactions have not always been properly approved, and therefore may be contested by minority shareholders. In the event that these other shareholders were successfully to contest past interested party transactions, or prevent the approval of such transactions in the future, our flexibility in operating these television stations could be limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain transactions between members of our consolidated corporate group may constitute interested party transactions under Russian law even when the companies involved are wholly owned by us. Although we generally endeavor to obtain all corporate approvals required under Russian law to consummate these transactions, we have not always applied special approval procedures in connection with our consummation of transactions with or between our subsidiaries. In the event that a claim is filed in relation to certain transactions with or between our subsidiaries, such transactions are found to have been interested party transactions, and we are found to have failed to obtain the appropriate approvals, such transactions may be declared invalid. The unwinding of any transactions concluded with or between our subsidiaries may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nShareholder liability under Russian legislation could cause us to become liable for the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nThe Russian Civil Code, the Law on Joint Stock Companies and the Law on Limited Liability Companies generally provide that shareholders in a Russian joint stock company or limited liability company are not liable for the obligations of the company and bear only the risk of loss of their investment. This may not be the case, however, when one person (an \"effective parent\") is capable of determining decisions made by another (an \"effective subsidiary\"). The effective parent bears joint and several responsibilities for transactions concluded by the effective subsidiary in carrying out these decisions in certain circumstances.\nIn addition, a parent is secondarily liable for an effective subsidiary's debts if an effective subsidiary becomes insolvent or bankrupt as a result of the action or inaction of the parent. This is the case no matter how the parent's capability to determine decisions of the effective subsidiary arises. For example, this liability could arise through ownership of voting securities or by contract. In these instances, other shareholders of the effective subsidiary may claim compensation for the effective subsidiary's losses from the parent that caused the effective subsidiary to act or fail to act, knowing that such action or inaction would result in losses. Accordingly, in CTC Media's position as a parent, it could be liable in some cases for the debts of its effective subsidiaries. Although the total indebtedness of CTC Media's effective subsidiaries is currently immaterial, it is possible that CTC Media could face\nmaterial liability in this regard in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nChanges in the Russian tax system or arbitrary or unforeseen application of existing rules could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur tax burden may become greater than the estimated amount that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets. Russian tax authorities have often been arbitrary and aggressive in their interpretation of tax laws and their many ambiguities, as well as in their enforcement and collection activities. Many companies are often forced to negotiate their tax bills with tax inspectors who may demand higher taxes than applicable law appears to provide. Any additional tax liability, as well as any unforeseen changes in Russian tax laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. We have at times accrued substantial amounts for contingent tax liabilities, a substantial portion of which accruals we have reversed as contingencies have been resolved favorably or changes in circumstances have occurred. The amounts currently accrued for tax contingencies may not be sufficient to meet any liability we may ultimately face. From time to time, we also identify tax contingencies for which we have not provided an accrual. Such unaccrued tax contingencies could materialize and require us to pay additional amounts of tax.\nUnder Russian accounting and tax principles, financial statements of our Russian companies are not consolidated for tax purposes. As a result, each Russian-registered entity in our group pays its own Russian taxes and we cannot offset the profits or losses in any single entity against the profits and losses of any other entity. Consequently, our overall effective tax rate may increase as we expand our operations, unless we are able to maintain an effective corporate structure that minimizes the effect of these Russian accounting and tax norms.\nThe Russian tax system imposes additional burdens and costs on our operations in Russia, and complicates our tax planning and related business decisions. The uncertainty involved potentially exposes us to significant fines, penalties and enforcement measures despite our best efforts at compliance, which could result in a greater than expected tax burden on our subsidiaries. These factors raise the risk of a sudden imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes on our operations in Russia. This could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nAny US or other foreign judgments that may be obtained against us may be difficult to enforce against us in Russia.\nAlthough CTC Media is a Delaware corporation, subject to suit in US federal and other courts, most of our assets are located in Russia, and all of our directors and their assets are located outside the United States. Although arbitration awards are generally enforceable in Russia, judgments obtained in the United States or in other foreign courts, including those with respect to US federal securities law claims, may not be enforceable in Russia. There is no mutual recognition treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation, and no Russian federal law provides for the recognition and enforcement of foreign court judgments. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce any US or other foreign court judgment obtained against our company, any of our operating subsidiaries or any of our directors in Russia.\nRisks relating to doing business elsewhere in the CIS\nWe face similar risks in other countries of the CIS.\nIn addition to Russia, we currently have operations in other countries in the CIS, including Kazakhstan and Moldova. We may acquire additional operations in other countries of the CIS. In many respects, the risks inherent in transacting business in these countries are similar to those in Russia, especially those risks set out above in \"-Risks relating to doing business and investing in Russia\".\nEmerging markets such as Russia and other CIS countries are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including legal, economic and political risks.\nInvestors in emerging markets such as Russia and other CIS countries should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases legal, economic and political risks. Investors should also note that emerging economies, such as the economies of Russia and Kazakhstan, are subject to rapid change and that the information set out herein may become outdated relatively quickly. Furthermore, in doing business in various countries of the CIS, we face risks similar to (and sometimes greater than) those that we face in Russia. For example, the current circumstances involving Ukraine, including international economic sanctions, may have deleterious macroeconomic and other effects on the regions in which we operate, including, among other things, increased volatility in foreign currency values and a weaker overall business environment. Moreover the recently adopted amendment to the Russian law On Mass Media restricts foreign investments over 20% in Russian mass media and broadcasting companies that may negatively affect our company and the price of its shares. According to recent publications in Russian mass media Ukraine is going to prohibit distribution (screening) of Russian movies, produced after the 1st of January, 2014 and depicting (and commending) Russian armed forces, special services, and other law enforcement authorities. This may adversely affect our business because we will not be able to broadcast or sublicense such films and series in Ukraine.\nAccordingly, investors should exercise care in evaluating the risks involved and must decide for themselves whether, in light of those risks, their investment is appropriate. Generally, investment in emerging markets is only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate the significance of the risks involved and investors are urged to consult with their own legal and financial advisors before making an investment in our shares. See also \"-The current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations, and may require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts.\" and \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change in the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock\".\nRisks relating to our stock\nThe price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nOur stock price has experienced significant volatility in the past and is likely to be volatile in the future, particularly in light of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and the pending implementation of the amended Mass Media law. The stock market in general and, in particular, the market in emerging markets, like Russia, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. This volatility has been more pronounced due to the turmoil in world financial markets, and most recently due to the current situation in Ukraine, including international economic sanctions. The macroeconomic environment in Russia has also resulted in a widespread deterioration in the price of Russian-exchange listed stocks and the stock of companies which predominantly operate in Russia and the CIS that are traded on other exchanges. Furthermore, the recently adopted amendment to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\", which restricts foreign ownership of mass media and broadcasting entities, has also had a significant negative impact on our company's stock price. Overall, our stock price was down by 65% from $13.9 per share at December 31, 2013 to $4.9 per share at December 31, 2014. See also \"-Geopolitical and macroeconomic events have adversely affected and created uncertainty and instability in the Russian economy\" and \"-Recently adopted amendments to the Russian law \"On Mass Media\" will further limit foreign ownership of Russian television broadcasters, which is likely to require a significant change\nin the ownership structure of our business, and may materially adversely affect our operations and/or our stockholders and the value of our common stock\". These factors create a high level of uncertainty regarding the stock price which the company can achieve in the near and long-term future.\nAs a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchase it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in economic, political and market conditions in Russia and globally;\n\u2022 changes in law;\n\u2022 developments related to international sanctions;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 extraordinary expenses or charges in particular periods, including material impairment losses;\n\u2022 changes in the audience shares of our networks;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of advertising sales in Russia;\n\u2022 public announcements by industry experts regarding trends in advertising spending in Russia and globally; and\n\u2022 announcements regarding our acquisition activities, if any.\nMoreover, only a relatively small number of shares of our common stock are currently actively traded in the public market. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock was held by parties other than our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders and their respective affiliates. The limited liquidity of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nInsiders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors, executive officers and our two principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 64% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, may have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our\ncompany. In particular, our two principal stockholders have entered into a voting arrangement that determines the composition of our board of directors, although the rights of Telcrest under this voting agreement are currently blocked pursuant to U.S. economic sanctions. See also \"-The current geopolitical situation regarding Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations, and will require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts.\"\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay change-of-control transactions.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make a change in control of our company more difficult. For example:\n\u2022 Stockholders' meetings may only be called by one of the Co-Chairmen of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or the majority of the board of directors.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not take action by written consent.\n\u2022 We have a classified board of directors, which means that our directors serve for staggered three-year terms and currently no more than three of our nine directors are elected each year.\nThis structure may make it more difficult for an acquirer to take control of our company, which may make our company a less desirable acquisition target.\nDelaware law also prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction or approves the transaction pursuant to which the holder became a 15% holder. Our board of directors may use this provision to prevent changes in our management. Our board of directors approved the transaction pursuant to which Telcrest became a holder of more than 15% of our capital stock, and accordingly this prohibition would not apply in the case of a business combination transaction with Telcrest.\nUnder applicable Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nIn addition, we are party to a stockholders' agreement with our two largest stockholders, MTG and Telcrest, pursuant to which each of these stockholders has agreed, with limited exceptions, not to acquire additional shares of our capital stock to the extent that such acquisition would cause its beneficial ownership to exceed 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares without making a tender offer for all of our outstanding shares in compliance with the tender offer rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless it reaches this ownership level through the exercise of rights of first offer set forth in the stockholders' agreement; Although the rights of Telcrest under this stockholders' agreement are currently blocked pursuant to U.S. economic sanctions.
