{"cik": "924805", "company": "Freedom Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements and information concerning us, our plans, and other future events. The risks described below are not the only ones we face, and the statements contained elsewhere in this annual report, including our financial statements, should be read together with these risk factors. The occurrence of any of, or a combination of, the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will likely continue to impact the global economy, global financial markets and our business which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic. The pandemic has affected every country in which we operate. In response to the pandemic, governments and communities have taken measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of businesses; social distancing; travel restrictions; \u201cshelter in place\u201d and other governmental regulations; which have caused significant volatility in the financial markets and general economic conditions. These measures have negatively impacted businesses, market participants, financial markets and the global economy and could continue to do so for a prolonged period of time.\nIn response to local COVID-19 related restrictions, a significant percentage of our employees have transitioned to working remotely. For those functions that cannot be performed remotely, we have implemented a number of measures to maintain the health and safety of our employees and customers, including reducing the hours our bank branch offices are open, meeting with customers only by appointment, limiting customer interaction to functions that cannot be performed remotely, limiting non-essential travel, cancelling in-person work-related meetings, and temperature screening. Widespread illness or long-term continuation of such measures could negatively impact our business.\nThe COVID-19 measures did not go into effect in most countries where we operate until the latter part of March 2020. As a result, we do not believe they had a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period ended March 31, 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, including any secondary outbreaks, and the impact on our customers, employees and the markets in which we operate, all of which is uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nOur business is affected by general business and economic conditions, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services is affected by a number of general business and economic conditions. A decline in the Russian, Kazakhstani, Ukrainian, Cypriot, European or United States financial markets or general economies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our services, could decline as a result of a number of factors beyond our control, including economic recessions, changes in customer preferences, investor and consumer confidence, inflation, availability of credit, fluctuation in interest and currency exchange rates, changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments, a widespread pandemic, such as COVID-19, and political circumstances (including wars and terrorist acts) in the regions in which we operate.\nWe cannot predict the duration of current conditions or the timing or strength of any future activities on economies generally, or the global markets. Weakness in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. More generally, because our business is correlated to the general economic outlook, a significant deterioration in that outlook or realization of certain events could have a significant negative impact on our businesses and overall results of operations.\nWe operate in emerging consumer financial services sectors in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which is a competitive landscape where increased competition from larger service providers with greater resources or superior service offerings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive our revenues from brokerage, banking and financial services businesses serving customers principally located in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Investing by retail customers, particularly in U.S. and European securities, is an emerging market in these countries, and we could encounter increased price competition as this industry matures and new online brokerage services become available. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as existing or new competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price or service. In addition, our retail brokerage business will likely face pressure from larger competitors, which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to retail brokerage clients in order to win their trading business. Our inability to compete effectively with our competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the financial condition and operations of our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiary companies must meet certain ongoing capital and liquidity standards, which are subject to evolving rules and qualitative judgments by government regulators regarding the adequacy of their capital and internal assessment of their capital needs. These net capital rules may limit the ability of each subsidiary to transfer capital to us. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how each subsidiary utilizes its capital and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by our subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may suffer significant losses from credit exposures.\nOur business is subject to the risk that a customer, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate to cover their obligations to us. We are also subject to the same risk in connection with our own failures in connection with our proprietary trading. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective to protect us against the risk of loss. Our exposure results principally from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, margin lending, clients\u2019 options trading, futures activities, securities lending, our role as counterparty in financial contracts, investing activities, and trading our proprietary trading.\nWhen we purchase securities on margin, enter into securities repurchase agreements, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that we, or our customers, may default on those obligations when the value of the securities and cash in our own proprietary or in the customers\u2019 accounts falls below the amount of the indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure to meet margin calls could result in substantial financial losses.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our proprietary investments. Our investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the Russian, Kazakhstani, European and U.S. financial markets\u2019 assessment of credit quality. Loss in securities value can negatively affect our financial performance and earnings if our management determines that such securities are other-than-temporarily-impaired (OTTI). The evaluation of whether OTTI exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If our management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted, and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the value of securities held in our proprietary portfolio could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were forced to sell the security sooner than intended, we may have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\nWe rely upon the use of credit arrangements as a significant component of our trading strategy. We are constantly searching for reliable counterparties for such transactions. Our inability to access an adequate pool of quality reliable counterparties to engage with could limit our ability to undertake certain transactions, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments can expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\nWe use a significant portion of our capital to engage in a variety of investment activities. We have relied on leveraging to increase the size of our proprietary portfolio. As a result, we might face risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies in which we invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategies may not perform as projected. As a result, we may suffer losses from our investment activities.\nOur proprietary portfolio is leveraged and concentrated in relatively few companies. A consequence of this investment strategy is that our investment returns could be materially and adversely affected if this investment does not perform as anticipated. Moreover, because we rely on leverage in our portfolio, when an investment such as this does not perform within the time horizon we project, we face significant risk of either having to close the position at a time when the market price or liquidity might be unfavorable, or extending financing arrangements beyond the time frame initially anticipated, which can result in paying higher financing costs than projected. If a significant investment such as this fails to perform as anticipated our return on investment, business, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively affected, and the magnitude of the loss could be significant.\nEven if we follow our investment policies, we cannot give assurance that the value of the investment will be profitable. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in the stock markets or economic slowdown, delays in timing of anticipated events, an inability to identify and engage suitable counterparties, or other market conditions adverse to companies or investments of the type in which we invest, or other world events, such as wars, natural disasters or the outbreak of a pandemic, could result in a decline in the value of our investments. Additionally, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the businesses and industries in which we invest.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our securities lending business.\nWe engage in securities lending business in which we borrow securities from one party and lend them to another. As a result, market risk in our securities lending business arises when the market value of securities borrowed declines relative to the cash posted as collateral with the lender; and when the market value of securities loaned increases relative to the cash received as collateral from the borrower. Market value fluctuations in our securities lending business are measured daily and any exposure versus cash received or posted is settled daily with counterparties. In addition, credit risk from our securities lending operations arises if a lender or borrower defaults on an outstanding securities loan or borrowing transaction and the cash or securities they are holding is insufficient to cover the amount they owe us for that receivable. Finally, there is systemic risk associated with the concentration of clearing and related functions in covered clearing agencies involved in securities lending activities. The market and credit risks associated with our securities lending business have the potential of adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating risks associated with our securities lending business may result in counterparty losses, and in certain circumstances, potential financial liabilities.\nAs part of our securities lending business, we lend securities to banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. We must manage this process and mitigate the associated operational risks. Failure to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for counterparties in the securities lending business apart from the risks of collateral investments. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks.\nLarger and more frequent capital commitments in our trading and underwriting business activities increases the potential for us to incur significant losses.\nWe commit our capital to maintain trading positions in the equity, convertible securities and debt markets. We may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital. The number and size of these large transactions may adversely affect our results of operations in a given period. Although we may take measures to manage market risk, such as employing position limits and using quantitative risk measures, we may incur significant losses from our trading activities due to leverage, market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and volatility. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in the value of those assets or markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent we have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially large losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nTo satisfy or refinance existing obligations, service our debt obligations, support the development of our business or pursue additional growth through acquisition, we depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to borrow funds and issue securities in the capital markets. To the extent we are unable to generate cash flows sufficient to meet our obligations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may require additional financing for liquidity, capital requirements or growth initiatives. We may not be able to obtain financing on terms and at interest rates that are favorable to us, or at all. An inability by us to obtain financing in the future could materially and adversely affect our plans, business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our executive management team, in particular Timur Turlov. If we are unable to hire, engage and retain skilled personnel, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our executive management team, in particular Timur Turlov, and the management teams of our subsidiaries. We believe our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. If certain individuals leave or are otherwise no longer available to us for any number of reasons, including because of the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, we may not be able to replace them with comparable capable personnel.\nThe pool of experienced and qualified employee candidates might be limited in the geographical areas where we conduct business, and competition for skilled employees might be significant. We are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, engage and retain skilled employees. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing and support personnel to effectively manage our business and to successfully promote our range of services. If we do not succeed in engaging and retaining skilled employees and other personnel, or if we experience a potential loss of such personnel, or their productivity significantly declines because of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to meet our objectives and, as a result, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information technology, or \u201cIT\u201d systems, including from cybersecurity threats, could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues, or both.\nOur broker-dealer, financial services and banking businesses are highly dependent on processing, on a daily basis, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in various languages. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems we or the firms that clear transactions on behalf of our customers use may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our facilities, as a result of any number of occurrences, including the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19. The inability of these systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our business operations. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, personnel, or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure at the exchanges, depositories, clearing houses, clearing firms and other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our customer transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk.\nOur ability to conduct business may also be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities in which we and third parties with whom we conduct business are located, including disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation, or other services, whether due to fire, natural disaster, a world health crisis, such as COVID-19, power or communications failure, act of terrorism, war, or otherwise. We have employees in a number of cities in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus, all of whom need to work and communicate as an integrated team. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers may suffer. While we have contingency plans in place to address such issues, these plans may not always be deployed successfully or be sufficiently adequate to fully offset the impacts of such disruptions. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because it may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, spyware or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. The occurrence of one or more of these events could: (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of our customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business; or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties with whom we conduct business. In addition, new and expanding data privacy laws and regulations are, or soon will be, in effect in many of the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and compliance failures could result in significant fines, penalties and liability.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the vast majority of our employees, including those who process our transactions are working remotely. While we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken other precautions designed to address cybersecurity, there is no guarantee such measures will adequately protect our business, as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data (either directly or through our vendors) and other electronic security breaches. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure and those of third parties we work with may be vulnerable to such cyber incidents. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated or misappropriated financial data, theft of our intellectual property or other confidential information (including of our customers, counterparties and employees), liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. In addition, if any information about our customers, counterparties or employees, including payment information, were the subject of a successful cybersecurity attack against us, we could be subject to litigation or other claims by the affected parties which could result in monetary damage awards against us. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement the security measures we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business operates and serves customers in a number of countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Germany and Cyprus. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u25cf\neconomic volatility and sustained economic downturns;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nchanges in securities brokerage, financial services and banking laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a number of foreign operations;\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax developments;\n\u25cf\nexposure to different legal standards;\n\u25cf\npolitical or social unrest, including terrorism;\n\u25cf\nrisks related to government regulation and uncertain protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nthe presence of corruption in certain countries.\nOne or more of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters could materially negatively impact our business.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters, could create, and in the case of COVID-19 has created, and may continue to create, economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to, or in the case of COVID-19 has led to, operational difficulties (including quarantine, shelter in place and travel limitations) that could impair, or in the case of COVID-19 have impaired, our ability to operate our business as it is normally operated.\nThe countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nThe countries in which we operate our financial services business have differing regulatory regimes governing the operation of broker-dealers in each country, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the finance, investment and banking industries. These provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change, and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents of various countries. Therefore, there may exist little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes may impact our operations. It is possible that those governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations will materially and adversely affect our activities in one or more of the countries where we operate. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is limited, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences. Our revenue and profitability could also be affected by changes to rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, foreign ownership, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, changes to these rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, or additional costs. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations that can impact our financial results.\nBecause our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and can have a material impact on our financial statements. Our functional currency is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiary companies include the Russian ruble, European euro, Ukrainian hryvnia, Uzbekistani som and the Kazakhstani tenge. For financial reporting purposes, those currencies are translated into United States dollars as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. As the value of the functional currencies of our subsidiaries weakens against the United States dollar, we may realize losses arising as a result of translating such foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Conversely, as the value of the United States dollar weakens against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we may realize gains arising as a result of currency translation.\nWe conduct operations in a number of different currencies. This subjects us to currency exchange rate risk. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure that such currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. While we may employ strategies to hedge against currency fluctuations, the use of such strategies can also result in the loss of potential benefits that might result from favorable exchange rate fluctuations.\nInterest rate changes could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in interest rates can impact our earnings. Declines in interest rates can have a detrimental effect on the interest we earn. While we believe we are positioned to benefit from rising interest rates, a rise in interest rates could negatively impact us if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets.\nWe are dependent upon our relationships with U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit funds internationally.\nFunds invested by our customers in securities of U.S. companies are transmitted to U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. Funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. We do not have any control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair our customer relationships. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with these U.S. registered securities broker-dealers and clearing firms could also impair our ability to continue to offer such services to our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nAcquisitions have been, and will likely continue to be, a significant component of our growth strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions as we have done historically or that businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, expand our customer base or enhance our existing service offerings. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, there is substantial cost and time expended to complete post-closing integration of acquisitions, including human resource training, data and technology systems and operational processes. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities. Any such difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and/or synergies of any such acquisition or investment.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the anti-corruption and anti-criminal regulations in effect in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the \u201cFCPA,\u201d and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws and anti-criminal laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings, resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nWe have operations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Germany and Cyprus. Enforcement officials interpret anti-corruption laws\u2019 prohibitions on improper payments to government officials to apply to officials like those of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Center for Coordination and Development of Securities Market of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the National Commission for securities markets of Ukraine and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory bodies that would control and monitor our operations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Cyprus. Our internal policies and those of our subsidiaries provide for compliance with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-criminal laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from unauthorized reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or independent contractors outside the scope of their employment. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption and anti-criminal laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are a holding company with little or no operations of our own other than the funding and management of our operating subsidiaries, however, our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.\nOur operations are conducted primarily through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide funds to the extent of our needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTimur Turlov has control over key decision making as a result of his ownership of a majority of our voting stock.\nTimur Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, beneficially owns 72.7% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Turlov currently has sole voting control of FRHC and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, stock splits, recapitalizations, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer, chairman of our board of directors and his ability to control the election of our directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Turlov owes fiduciary duties to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a stockholder, however, Mr. Turlov is entitled to vote his shares of common stock according to his personal interests, which may not always be in the interest of our stockholders generally. Mr. Turlov is prohibited from membership of our audit committee under the terms of the audit committee charter adopted by our board of directors.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u25cf\nindustry or general market conditions;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u25cf\ncountry risk associated with the countries in which we conduct operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u25cf\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u25cf\nlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\n\u25cf\nactions by large position stockholders, including future sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us of significant impairment charges;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships;\n\u25cf\ncompletions of significant asset acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u25cf\nwar, terrorist acts, civil unrest and epidemic disease;\n\u25cf\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nmisconduct or other improper actions of our employees.\nStock markets can experience extreme volatility unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFuture offerings of securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to fix the relative rights and preferences of our 20,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, without approval from our stockholders. This could affect the rights of our common stockholders regarding, among other things, voting, distributions, dividends and liquidation. We could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control of FRHC that may be opposed by our management, even if the transaction might be favorable to our common stockholders.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is possible that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in FRHC.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, are expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nWe are subject to extensive corporate governance, reporting and accounting disclosure requirements under U.S. securities laws and regulations of the SEC. These laws, as well as the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, impose certain compliance requirements, costs and obligations on listed companies. This requires a significant commitment of resources and management oversight. The expenses associated with being a public company include auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act or Dodd-Frank Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory, exchange or market authorities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to use our future earnings, if any, to repay debt, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. We are not likely to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in the value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain their current value. Payments of dividends, if any, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, Nevada law imposes additional requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nWe are deemed to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nTimur Turlov controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by one individual is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including:\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that our nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u25cf\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe currently utilize exemptions to allow for one non-independent director to sit on each of our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee. The charters for each of those committees provide for annual performance evaluations. Currently we do have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.", "PERMNO": 91437, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FRHC"}
