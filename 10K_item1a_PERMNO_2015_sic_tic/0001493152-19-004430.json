Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K we file after the date of this Annual Report. Each of the risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause an investor to lose all or part of his or her investment. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of $10,325,000 and used cash in operations of $9,258,000. As of December 31, 2018, we had a cash balance of $624,000, a stockholder\u2019s deficit of $6,743,000 and a working capital shortfall of $3,297,000, compared to a cash balance of $12,127,000, stockholder\u2019s equity of $508,000 and working capital of $2,303,000 at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced significant financing shortages and engaged in three separate transactions to raise capital. Recently, the Company received net proceeds of $14,905,602 from an underwritten offering of common stock in February 2019. Proceeds from the offering are expected to provide capital to fund the growth of our business, new products, sales and marketing efforts, working capital, and for general corporate purposes through 2020. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of opening new retail outlets, our product development and marketing pull efforts and market acceptance of our core and new products and packages.\nIf we continue to suffer losses from operations, our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time, unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations, including reducing infrastructure, promotions, sales and marketing programs, personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the growth of our operations, take advantage of opportunities, develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, could be significantly limited.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, which may not be available when needed or may be costly and dilutive.\nWe may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary, we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, which may include, without limitation, public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, and other strategic alternatives; however, these options may not ultimately be available or feasible.\nOur indebtedness and liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur existing indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breach of financial covenants. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions or covenants, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nOur secured credit facility with Rosenthal and Rosenthal, Inc. contains financial covenants that, if breached, could trigger default.\nPursuant to our Financing Agreement with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. (\u201cRosenthal\u201d) dated October 4, 2018 for our secured credit facility, we are required to maintain at the end of each of our fiscal quarters, tangible net worth in an amount not less than negative $1,500,000 and working capital of not less than negative $2,500,000. We did not meet these requirements for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, and Rosenthal waived compliance with these covenants for this period for a $5,000 fee. Any breach that is not waived by Rosenthal could trigger default. Reed\u2019s does not expect to have any difficulty meeting the requirements of these financial covenants in the near future, given the proceeds received from the Company\u2019s recent financing transaction.\nDisruption within our supply chain, contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, through our suppliers, business partners, contract manufacturers, independent distributors and retailers, to produce, transport, distribute and sell products is critical to our success.\nDamage or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics such as influenza, labor strikes or other reasons, could impair the manufacture, distribution and sale of our products. Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on distributors, retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable distributors, retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors, retailers and brokers sell and distribute competing products and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the distributors, retailers and brokers of this network. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other beverage companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors, retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such third-parties\u2019 financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sales activities.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract additional distributors, retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf the level of demand for our brands and products in a particular distribution area;\n\u25cf our ability to price our products at levels competitive with those of competing products; and\n\u25cf our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors, retailers and brokers.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Our inability to achieve success with regards to any of these factors in a geographic Fdistribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships in that particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market, which will likely adversely affect our revenues and financial results.\nWe incur significant time and expense in attracting and maintaining key distributors.\nOur marketing and sales strategy depends in large part on the availability and performance of our independent distributors. We currently do not have, nor do we anticipate in the future that we will be able to establish, long-term contractual commitments from some of our distributors. We may not be able to maintain our current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with distributors in new geographic distribution areas. Moreover, there is the additional possibility that we may have to incur additional expenditures to attract and maintain key distributors in one or more of our geographic distribution areas in order to profitably exploit our geographic markets.\nIf we lose any of our key distributors or national retail accounts, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in large part on distributors to distribute our beverages and other products. Some of our outside distributors are not bound by written agreements with us and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Some distributors handle a number of competitive products. In addition, our products are a small part of our distributors\u2019 businesses.\nWe continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into distribution arrangements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.\nThe marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIt is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors are not required to place minimum orders with us.\nOur independent distributors and national accounts are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. In order to reduce their inventory costs, independent distributors typically order products from us on a \u201cjust in time\u201d basis in quantities and at such times based on the demand for the products in a particular distribution area. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally, our larger distributors and partners may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels, supply of raw materials or other key supplies could negatively affect us.\nIf we do not adequately manage our inventory levels, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly for new products, seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products, we may end up with too much inventory, resulting in higher storage costs, increased trade spending and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand, we could damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would also unfavorably impact our sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur dependence on independent contract manufacturers could make management of our manufacturing and distribution efforts inefficient or unprofitable.\nWe are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements, which is customary in the contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the particular geographic area where our contract manufacturers are located, we continually evaluate which of our contract manufacturers to use. To the extent demand for our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing arrangements, or orders are not submitted on a timely basis, we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely, we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the actual demand for it, resulting in higher storage costs and the potential risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts, which, in turn, would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective relationships with those distributors and key accounts.\nIncreases in costs of packaging, ingredients and contract manufacturing tolling fees may have an adverse impact on our gross margin.\nOver the past few years, costs of organic and natural ingredients have increased due to increased demand and required the Company to obtain these ingredients from a wider population of qualified vendors. Packaging costs such as paper and aluminum cans have experienced industry wide price increases in the past and there is always the risk that the company\u2019s co-packers increase their toll rates based on increases in their fixed and variable costs. If the Company is unable to pass on these costs, the gross margin will be significantly impacted.\nIncreased market spending may not drive volume growth\nThe Company\u2019s marketing efforts in the past have been limited. The current increase in marketing spending may not generate an increase in sales volume resulting in a net decrease in gross revenue.\nIncreases in costs of energy and freight may have an adverse impact on our gross and operating margins.\nOver the past few years, volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in high fuel prices, which many shipping companies have passed on to their customers by way of higher base pricing and increased fuel surcharges. With recent declines in fuel prices, some companies have been slow to pass on decreases in their fuel surcharges. If fuel prices increase again, we expect to experience higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges, as well as energy surcharges on our raw materials. It is hard to predict what will happen in the fuel markets in 2019. Due to the price sensitivity of our products, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our efficiency and operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in such areas as sales, marketing, product development, supply chain, finance and accounting. In general, we compete to hire new employees, and, in some cases, must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any unplanned turnover, particularly involving our key personnel, could negatively impact our operations, financial condition and employee morale.\nIf we fail to protect our trademarks and trade secrets, we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and trade secrecy laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks and trade secrets, to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success, and we actively pursue the registration of our trademarks in the United States and internationally. However, the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks, trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands, profitably exploit our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks, uncertainties and costs, including distraction of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in sales of products in international markets.\nOur operations outside of the United States contribute to our revenue and profitability, and we believe that developing and emerging markets present important future growth opportunities for us. However, there can be no assurance that existing or new products that we manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular foreign market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. Here are many factors that could adversely affect demand for our products in foreign markets, including our inability to attract and maintain key distributors in these markets; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets; changes in economic, political or social conditions, imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other legal restrictions; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; inflationary currency, devaluation or fluctuation; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations. If we are unable to effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in international markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.\nThe United States generally accepted accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide variety of matters that are relevant to our business, such as, but not limited to, stock-based compensation, trade spend and promotions, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes to these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our stock price and investor confidence could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective. Because of their inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, however well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the controls will prevent or detect misstatements. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. The failure of controls by design deficiencies or absence of adequate controls could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, which could also negatively impact our stock price and investor confidence.\nIf we are unable to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure, our business could suffer.\nWe depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers, as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches.\nWe could be subject to cybersecurity attacks.\nCybersecurity attacks are evolving and include malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business processes, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Such unauthorized access could subject us to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure, and harm our business.\nWe must maintain our stockholders\u2019 equity at no less than $6 million to meet continued listing standards of the NYSE American or meet the $50,000,000 market capitalization exception.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a stockholder\u2019s deficit of $6,743,000 compared to stockholder\u2019s equity of $508,000 at December 31, 2017.\nOn February 15, 2019, we entered into an agreement for an underwritten public offering of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of $14,905,602. See Note 17 of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. Giving pro forma effect to the offering as of December 31, 2018, stockholders\u2019 equity would have been $8,163,000 and working capital would have been $11,609,000 on that date.\nA delisting of our common stock and our inability to list the stock on another national securities exchange could negatively impact us by: (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees. While a delisting of our common stock would not constitute a specific event of default under the documents governing our senior credit facilities, our lenders could claim that a delisting would trigger a default under the material adverse change covenant or the cross-default provisions under such documents.\nRisks Factors Relating to Our Industry\nThe current aluminum can shortage could harm our ability to meet consumer demand.\nAs a craft beverage company, we do not meet volume requirements to have a contract in place with our aluminum can supplier. Craft beverage companies such as us are facing an aluminum can shortage for certain sizes. While standard 12 ounce can supply is not in short supply, we will continue to see supply issues with non-standard cans such as slim cans in 8, 10, and 12 ounces. This aluminum can shortage could harm our ability to timely produce enough product to meet consumer demand.\nWe may experience a reduced demand for some of our products due to health concerns (including obesity) and legislative initiatives against sweetened beverages.\nConsumers are concerned about health and wellness; public health officials and government officials are increasingly vocal about obesity and its consequences. There has been a trend among some public health advocates and dietary guidelines to recommend a reduction in sweetened beverages, as well as increased public scrutiny, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, and additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling/packing of the beverage industry. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, tax or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, increasing public concern with respect to sweetened beverages could reduce demand for our beverages and increase desire for more low-calorie soft drinks, water, enhanced water, coffee-flavored beverages, tea, and beverages with natural sweeteners. We are continuously working to launch new products that round out our diversified portfolio.\nLegislative or regulatory changes that affect our products could reduce demand for products or increase our costs.\nTaxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal, state and local governments in the United States, Canada or other countries in which we operate could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our beverages. Several municipalities in the United States have implemented or are considering implementing taxes on the sale of certain \u201csugared\u201d beverages, including non-diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters to help fund various initiatives. These taxes could materially affect our business and financial results.\nAdditional taxes levied on us could harm our financial results.\nRecent legislative proposals to reform U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by subjecting a significant portion of our non-U.S. earnings to incremental U.S. taxation and/or by delaying or permanently deferring certain deductions otherwise allowed in calculating our U.S. tax liabilities.\nWe compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brands as beverage brands that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors\u2019 existing beverage sales. Although we believe that we have been relatively successful towards establishing our brands as recognizable brands in the all-natural \u201cbetter for you\u201d beverage industry, it may be too early in the product life cycle of these brands to determine whether our products and brands will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors, retail customers and consumers. We believe that the success of our brands will also be substantially dependent upon acceptance of our product name brands. Accordingly, any failure of our brands to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\nCompetition from traditional non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers may adversely affect our distribution relationships and may hinder development of our existing markets, as well as prevent us from expanding our markets.\nWe target a niche in the estimated $90 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the US, Canada and international markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural, with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal (craft), premium bottled carbonated soft drink category. The soft drink industry is highly fragmented, and the craft soft drink category consists of such competitors as IBC, Stewart\u2019s, Zevia, Henry Weinhards, Hansen\u2019s, Izze, Boylan and Jones Soda, to name a few. These brands have the advantage of being seen widely in the national market and being commonly known for years through well-funded ad campaigns. Our products have a relatively high price for an artisanal premium beverage product, minimal mass media advertising to date and a small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to some of our larger competitors.\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail outlets and for marketing focus by our distributors, all of which also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than ours. Some of these competitors are placing pressure on independent distributors not to carry competitive sparkling brands such as ours. We also compete with regional beverage producers and \u201cprivate label\u201d soft drink suppliers.\nIncreased competitor consolidations, market-place competition, particularly among branded beverage products, and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our distribution channels, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network, we intend to introduce new, innovative products and packages. We may not be successful in doing this and other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition, particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets, as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception, so our ability to continue developing new products to satisfy our consumers\u2019 changing preferences will determine our long-term success.\nFailure to introduce new products or product extensions into the marketplace as current ones mature and to meet our consumers\u2019 changing preferences could prevent us from gaining market share and achieving long-term profitability. Product lifecycles can vary, and consumers\u2019 preferences and loyalties change over time. Although we try to anticipate these shifts and innovate new products to introduce to our consumers, we may not succeed. Customer preferences also are affected by factors other than taste, such as health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns, shifting consumer needs, changes in consumer lifestyles, increased consumer information and competitive product and pricing pressures. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the negative publicity associated with these issues. If we do not adequately anticipate or adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences, we may not be able to maintain and grow our brand image and our sales may be adversely affected.\nGlobal economic conditions may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe beverage industry, and particularly those companies selling premium beverages, can be affected by macro-economic factors, including changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions, unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns, which together may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending. Adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital needs, which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they have done in the past. If we experience adverse economic conditions in the future, sales of our products could be adversely affected, collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised, and we may face obsolescence issues with our inventory, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we encounter product recalls or other product quality issues, our business may suffer.\nProduct quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish our image and could cause consumers to choose other products. In addition, because of changing government regulations or implementation thereof, or allegations of product contamination, we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific markets. Product recalls could affect our profitability and could negatively affect brand image.\nWe could be exposed to product liability claims.\nAlthough we have product liability and basic recall insurance, insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all product liability claims that may arise. To the extent our product liability coverage is insufficient, a product liability claim would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition. In addition, any product liability claim brought against us may materially damage the reputation and brand image of our products and business.\nOur business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.\nThe production, marketing and sale of our beverages, including contents, labels, caps and containers, are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial, state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we cannot anticipate whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.\nVarious jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of our products. These types of requirements, if they become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, may inhibit sales of such products. In California, a law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. If a component found in one of our products is added to the list, or if the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become available under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in one of our beverages produced for sale in California, the resulting warning requirements or adverse publicity could affect our sales.\nWe may not be able to develop successful new beverage products, which are important to our growth.\nAn important part of our strategy is to increase our sales through the development of new beverage products. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to develop, market and distribute future beverage products that will enjoy market acceptance. The failure to continue to develop new beverage products that gain market acceptance could have an adverse impact on our growth and materially adversely affect our financial condition. We may have higher obsolescent product expense if new products fail to perform as expected due to the need to write off excess inventory of the new products.\nOur results of operations may be impacted in various ways by the introduction of new products, even if they are successful, including the following:\n\u25cf sales of new products could adversely impact sales of existing products;\n\u25cf we may incur higher cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses in the periods when we introduce new products due to increased costs associated with the introduction and marketing of new products, most of which are expensed as incurred; and\n\u25cf when we introduce new platforms and package sizes, we may experience increased freight and logistics costs as our co-packers adjust their facilities for the new products.\nThe growth of our revenues is dependent on acceptance of our products by mainstream consumers.\nWe have dedicated significant resources to introduce our products to the mainstream consumer. As such, we have increased our sales force and executed agreements with distributors who, in turn, distribute to mainstream consumers at grocery stores and other retailers. If our products are not accepted by the mainstream consumer, our business could suffer.\nOur failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, glass, cans, cartons, labels, flavors or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Furthermore, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk.\nThe loss of our largest customers would substantially reduce revenues.\nOur customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had two broker/distributors that accounted for approximately 24% and 17% of its sales, respectively; and during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had two broker/distributors that accounted for 23% and 16% of its sales, respectively. These two broker/distributors serve hundreds if not thousands of various retail chains and end customers.\nNo other customer exceeded 10% of sales for either period.\nThe loss of our largest vendors would substantially reduce revenues.\nOur vendors are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing vendors, our business could suffer.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s two largest vendors accounted for 16% and 13% of its purchases, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made 20% of its purchases from a single vendor.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, accounts payable to the Company\u2019s largest vendor comprised 24% and 20% of our total accounts payable, respectively.\nNo other account was more than 10% of the balance of accounts payable in either period.\nThe loss of our third-party distributors could impair our operations and substantially reduce our financial results.\nWe depend in large part on distributors to distribute our beverages and other products. Some of our outside distributors are not bound by written agreements with the Company and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Some distributors handle a number of competitive products. In addition, our products are a small part of our distributors\u2019 businesses.\nWe continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into distribution arrangements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.\nThe marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPrice fluctuations in, and unavailability of, raw materials and packaging that we use could adversely affect us.\nWe do not enter into hedging arrangements for raw materials. Although the prices of raw materials that we use have not increased significantly in recent years, our results of operations would be adversely affected if the price of these raw materials were to rise and we were unable to pass these costs on to our customers.\nWe depend upon an uninterrupted supply of the ingredients for our products, a significant portion of which we obtain overseas, principally from Peru, Brazil, Fiji and Indonesia. We do not have agreements guaranteeing supply of our ingredients. Any decrease in the supply of these ingredients or increase in the prices of these ingredients as a result of any adverse weather conditions, pests, crop disease, interruptions of shipment or political considerations, among other reasons, could substantially increase our costs and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe also depend upon an uninterrupted supply of packaging materials, such as glass, cans and paper items. We obtain bottles both domestically and internationally. Any decrease in supply of these materials or increase in the prices of the materials, as a result of decreased supply or increased demand, could substantially increase our costs and adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe loss of any of our co-packers could impair our operations and substantially reduce our financial results.\nWe rely on third parties, called co-packers in our industry, to produce our beverages.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had utilized three separate US based co-packers for most its production needs. Although there are other packers that could produce the Company\u2019s beverages, a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process, which could ultimately affect operating results.\nOur co-packing arrangements with other companies are on a short-term basis and such co-packers may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Our co-packing arrangements expose us to various risks, including:\n\u25cf if any of those co-packers were to terminate our co-packing arrangement or have difficulties in producing beverages for us, our ability to produce our beverages would be adversely affected until we were able to make alternative arrangements; and\n\u25cf our business reputation would be adversely affected if any of the co-packers were to produce inferior quality.\nWe believe that we have substantially reduced this risk by reducing our reliance upon any single co-packer. While our relationships with our existing co-packers are long-standing and beneficial, for 2019 we have also entered into co-packing agreements with CCB, the purchaser of our Los Angeles plant, and Sonoma Beverage Company, on the west coast. We are in discussion and negotiation with additional co-packers to ensure added capability for future production needs.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception, so our ability to continue to market our existing products and develop new products to satisfy our consumers\u2019 changing preferences will determine our long-term success.\nConsumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods, we may have to reduce profit margins, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, there is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of obesity. This may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers\u2019 preferences change. The beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We also may be unable to penetrate new markets. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of the seasonality of our business.\nOur highest revenues occur during the summer and fall, the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. These seasonality issues may cause our financial performance to fluctuate. In addition, beverage sales can be adversely affected by sustained periods of bad weather.\nOur manufacturing process is not patented.\nNone of the manufacturing processes used in producing our products are subject to a patent or similar intellectual property protection. Our only protection against a third party using our recipes and processes is confidentiality agreements with the companies that produce our beverages and with our employees who have knowledge of such processes. If our competitors develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our knowledge, we will have greater difficulty in competing with them for business, and our market share could decline.\nIf we are not able to retain the full-time services of our management team, it will be more difficult for us to manage our operations and our operating performance could suffer.\nOur business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our management team. We do have a written employment agreement with two of five members of our management team. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our management team. Therefore, in the event of the loss or unavailability of any member of the management team to us, there can be no assurance that we would be able to locate in a timely manner or employ qualified personnel to replace him or her. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel over time would jeopardize our ability to execute our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and a shareholder\u2019s investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the volume and market price of our common stock, and this volatility may continue in the future. In addition, factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results, litigation involving us, general trends relating to the beverage industry, actions by governmental agencies, national economic and stock market considerations as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock and the relative volatility of such market price.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. If we are unable to raise the funds required for all of our planned operations and key initiatives, we may be forced to allocate funds from other planned uses, which may negatively impact our business and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations.\nMany factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price of our shares. These factors include:\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets;\n\u25cf changes in our revenues and earnings or other variations in operating results;\n\u25cf any shortfall in revenue or increase in losses from levels expected by us or securities analysts;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory policies or law;\n\u25cf operating performance of companies comparable to us; and\n\u25cf general economic trends and other external factors.\nEven if an active market for our common stock is established, stockholders may have to sell their shares at prices substantially lower than the price they paid for them or might otherwise receive than if a broad public market existed.\nThere has been a very limited public trading market for our securities and the market for our securities may continue to be limited, and be sporadic and highly volatile.\nThere is currently a limited public market for our common stock. Holders of our common stock may, therefore, have difficulty selling their shares, should they decide to do so. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any shares which may be purchased, may be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price of our shares may not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value, and may not be indicative of the market price for the shares in the future.\nFuture financings could adversely affect common stock ownership interest and rights in comparison with those of other security holders.\nOur board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock up to the amounts authorized in our certificate of incorporation without stockholder approval, subject to restrictive covenants contained in the Company\u2019s contracts. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we issue any additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each other stockholder. In addition, such stock issuances might result in a reduction of the book value of our common stock. Any increase of the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock would require board and shareholder approval and subsequent amendment to our certificate of incorporation.\nAlcohol Risk Factors\nOur \u201cReady to Drink Mule\u201d initiative is in its early stages and may not materialize or develop as planned due to business and regulatory factors.\nOur ready to drink Mule test pilot is in its early stages, and may not materialize or develop as planned due to a myriad of business and regulatory factors. For example, many companies have already entered, and many new companies are beginning to enter, the ready to drink alcoholic beverage space and competition for market share and acceptance of new products we will be significant. Many details concerning our planned launch remain under development and the pilot test may not be as successful as planned.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in consumer preferences and trends.\nConsumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends, public health initiatives, product innovations, changes in vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions, which may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences away from ginger beer based cocktails toward beer, wine or non-alcoholic beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations. The competitive position of our brands could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or in service levels to customers.\nWe face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.\nWe compete based on product taste and quality, brand image, price, service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large, well-funded international companies. It is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.\nAnti-alcohol groups have, in the past, advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could, in turn, significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth, causing a decline in our results of operations.\nClass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.\nCompanies in the beverage alcohol industry are, from time to time, exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising, product liability, alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry, and it is possible that we, as well as our suppliers, could be named in litigation of this type.\nAlso, lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants\u2019 advertisements, marketing and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits, we could be named in similar lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against, depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and, if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail, our business could be harmed significantly.\nRegulatory decisions and legal, regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs and reduce our margins.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in all of the countries in which we operate. This may include regulations regarding production, distribution, marketing, advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover, because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation, we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems, including driving while intoxicated, underage drinking, alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol, various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties, suspension or even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business, as we could find it necessary to raise our prices to maintain profit margins, which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our sales and profit potential.\nAlso, the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the U.S. and internationally (and, in the U.S., at both the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.\nCBD/Hemp Extract Risk Factors\nOur Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract initiative is in its early stages and may not materialize or develop as planned due to business and regulatory factors.\nOur Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract test pilot is in its early stages, and may not materialize or develop as planned due a myriad of business and regulatory factors. For example, many companies are entering the CBD space and competition for market share and acceptance of new products will be significant. Many details concerning our planned launch remain under development and the pilot test may not be as successful as planned.\nNegative press from having a hemp or cannabis-related line of business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere is a misconception that hemp and marijuana, which both belong to the cannabis family, are the same thing, but industrial hemp is roughly defined as a cannabis plant with not more than 0.3 percent THC content on a dry-weight basis. Any hemp oil or hemp derivative we use will comport with this definition of less than 0.3% THC. Despite this, we may still receive negative attention from regulatory bodies, the press, business clients, or partners, grounded in these broad misconceptions, and this in turn can materially adversely affect our business.\nPossible yet unanticipated changes in federal law could cause our products which include cannabis/industrial hemp CBD extracts to be illegal, or could otherwise prohibit, limit or restrict our business and products, forcing us to abandon our business activities or reduce our financial prospects.\nThe move toward ending hemp prohibition and the reemergence of a hemp economy began with the 2014 Farm Bill, which provided states with opportunities to create pilot programs for hemp research. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (\u201c2018 Bill\u201d) was signed into law at the end of December 2018 and expands on the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2018 Bill removes \u201chemp\u201d from the definition of \u201cMarihuana\u201d in the Controlled Substances Act, decriminalizes the plant and its components, and as a result, transfers oversight of the cultivation and sale of the crop from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The net result of the 2018 Bill\u2019s passage is that farmers and entrepreneurs gain several significant benefits, in addition to ending the uncertainty of criminal exposure for growing, processing or selling hemp:\n\u25cf Federal licensing for farmers wishing to grow hemp in states that don\u2019t have a pilot program\n\u25cf Clarification that interstate commerce in hemp is permitted\n\u25cf Placing oversight of hemp with the USDA\n\u25cf Including hemp in the Federal Crop Insurance Act.\nThese provisions will go a long way toward helping the industry by clarifying existing gray areas of law, creating certainty around transport and interstate sale, and normalizing hemp as an industrial crop. However, there can be no assurance that Federal laws ending hemp prohibition will not be modified or repealed. In the event of either repeal of Federal regulations, or of amendments thereto which are adverse to our business and products, we may be required to cease operations or restrict or limit our products or the distribution thereof, which could be expected to have adverse consequences to our business, operations, revenues and profitability.\nSources of our key ingredient, CBD extracts from cannabis/industrial hemp plants, depend upon legality of cultivation, processing, marketing and sales of products derived from those plants.\nOur key ingredient is broad spectrum CBD extracts derived from cannabis/industrial hemp plants. CBD may be legally produced in states which have laws and regulations that qualify under 7 US Code \u00a75940 for implementation of \u201cagricultural pilot programs to study the growth, cultivation or marketing of industrial hemp\u201d, apart from state laws legalizing and regulating medical and recreational cannabis or marijuana which remains illegal under federal law. In addition, Federal licensing for farmers wishing to grow hemp in states that don\u2019t have a pilot program is now available as a result of the 2018 Bill. If we were to be unsuccessful in arranging new sources of supply of our raw ingredients, or if our raw ingredients were to become legally unavailable, our business and operations could be limited, restricted or entirely prohibited, which could be expected to have adverse consequences to our business, operations, revenues and profitability.\nWe may have difficulty accessing the service of banks which may make it difficult for us to operate.\nMany banks have not historically accepted deposits from and credit card processors will not clear transactions for businesses involved with the broadly defined cannabis industry, notwithstanding the legality of cannabis/industrial hemp derived products. While the 2018 Bill is expected to alleviate this hindrance, we may still have difficulty finding a bank and credit card processor willing to accept our business. The inability to open or maintain bank accounts or accept credit card payments from customers could be expected to cause us difficulty processing transactions in the ordinary course of business, including paying suppliers, employees and landlords, which could have a significant negative effect on our operations and your investment in our common stock.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we are not able to achieve our objectives for our business, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.\nIn order to be successful, we believe that we must, among other things:\n\u25cf increase the volume for our products\n\u25cf continue to find savings in our cost of goods (co-packer fees, packaging and ingredients);\n\u25cf expand the number of co-packers for our core and innovation products;\n\u25cf continue to recruit and retain top talent;\n\u25cf drive increased awareness through our brand pull campaigns, and trial and repeat purchase of our core brands;\n\u25cf drive increased SKU placement on shelf, and open new outlets of retail distribution through our investment in sales resources, partnerships and trade marketing support;\n\u25cf manage our operating expenses to sufficiently support operating activities and\n\u25cf avoid significant increases in variable costs relating to production, marketing and distribution.\nWe may not be able to meet these objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have incurred significant operating expenses in the past and may do so again in the future and, as a result, will need to increase revenues in order to improve our results of operations. Our ability to increase sales volume will depend primarily on success in marketing initiatives with industry brokers, improving our distribution base with DSD companies, introducing new no sugar brands, and focusing on the existing core brands in the market. Our ability to successfully enter new distribution areas and obtain national accounts will, in turn, depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the continued demand for our brands and products in target markets, the ability to price our products at competitive levels, the ability to establish and maintain relationships with distributors in each geographic area of distribution and the ability in the future to create, develop and successfully introduce one or more new brands, products, and product extensions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u25cf specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u25cf establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; and\n\u25cf prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management, and may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nFurthermore, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n\u25cf before the stockholder became interested, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u25cf upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and employee stock plans, in some instances; or\n\u25cf at or after the time the stockholder became interested, the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions the Company\u2019s board of directors does not approve in advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of Common Stock held by stockholders.\nThese provisions of Delaware law and the Certificate of Incorporation could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in the Company\u2019s management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nRaptor/ Harbor Reeds SPV LLC (\u201cRaptor), our largest shareholder, holds approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock and beneficially owns approximately 22% of our common stock and may greatly influence the outcome of all matters on which stockholders vote.\nBecause Raptor holds approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock and beneficially owns approximately 22% of our common stock, it may greatly influence the outcome of all matters on which stockholders vote. Daniel J. Doherty, III, a principal and shareholder of Raptor also serves as a director of Reed\u2019s. Raptor is a secured creditor of Reed\u2019s and its interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. (Beneficial ownership is calculated pursuant to Section 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and includes shares underlying derivative securities which may be exercised or converted within 60 days.)\nCollectively, members of our board of directors and our executive officers hold approximately 21% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, beneficially own approximately 33% of our common stock and may greatly influence the outcome of all matters on which stockholders vote.\nCollectively, members of our board of directors and our executive officers hold approximately 21% of our outstanding common stock and beneficially own approximately 33% of our common stock. Of these percentages, Daniel J. Doherty III, a director of Reed\u2019s, as principal and shareholder of Raptor/Harbor Reeds SPV LLC (\u201cRaptor\u201d) beneficially owns approximately 22% of our common stock. Members of our board of directors and our executive officers may influence the outcome of certain matters on which stockholders vote. (Beneficial ownership is calculated pursuant to Section 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and includes shares underlying derivative securities which may be exercised or converted within 60 days.)\nRaptor\u2019s interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nRaptor is a secured creditor of Reed\u2019s, holding a subordinated note with a principal balance of $3,400,000 and additional reserved principal amount of $4,000,000 to cover the permitted over-advance under Rosenthal\u2019s $13,000,0000 credit facility. Raptor\u2019s security interest is subordinate to Rosenthal\u2019s first priority security interest. The $4,000,000 permitted over-advance is guaranteed by Daniel J. Doherty, III and Daniel J. Doherty, III 2002 Family Trust through the issuance of an irrevocable stand-by-letter of credit in favor of Rosenthal, in amount not less than $1,500,000. The permitted over-advance is secured by all of Reed\u2019s intellectual property collateral. In the event of default under Reed\u2019s financing agreement with Rosenthal, Raptor has a put option to purchase the entire aggregate amount of the outstanding permitted over-advance of up to $4,000,000 at par plus accrued interest (without regard to any prepayment penalty or premium) from Rosenthal, prior to Rosenthal declaring a default under the financing agreement. If Raptor exercises the option, Rosenthal will release its first priority security interest on all intellectual property collateral of the Company to Raptor and terminate the letter of credit. As such, Raptor\u2019s interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of Reed\u2019s common stock.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports, or do not publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. As a result, the market price for our common stock may decline.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and shares of preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause your investment to be diluted.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to issue up to 70,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock. The power of the Board of Directors to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our common stock, or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock, may have the effect of diluting your investment, and the new securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nSubstantial sales of our stock may impact the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of options and warrants, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, and the price of our common stock may fall.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and investors may be unable to sell some or all of their shares at the price they would like, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, so our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell their shares.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell such shares.", "PERMNO": 92449, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "REED"}
