{"cik": "1392380", "company": "Gevo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical changes and international operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations and our liquidity. The risks described below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements we have made in this Report, the information incorporated herein by reference and those forward-looking statements we may make from time to time.\nRisk Related to our Business and Strategy\nOur business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially and adversely impacted by it in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity, including the global transportation industry and its supply chain, and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. It has also resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of businesses in various industries including, among others, the airline industry, and significantly reduced overall economic output. It is possible that that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic activity could negatively impact our revenue and operating results for 2021 and beyond. In light of the current and potential future disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, we considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This analysis considered our resilience and continuity plans, financial modeling and stress testing of liquidity and financial resources. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global transportation industry could continue to result in less demand for our transportation fuel products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition for the foreseeable future. The suspension of ethanol production at our Luverne Facility and reduction in our workforce during the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 had an adverse impact on our financial results for the fiscal year ended 2020 reducing revenue by 77% compared to 2019. There is also a risk that COVID-19 could have a material adverse impact on the development of our Net-Zero 1 Project, customer demand and cash flow, depending on the extent of our future production activities.\nIn addition, we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, across all of our facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and mask use. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees, illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, production, distribution or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.\nThe risks generally associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could magnify other risks discussed in this Report and any of our SEC filings. For example, the rapidly evolving changes in financial markets could have a material impact on our ability to obtain additional financing, which could impact our liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could make it more difficult to raise money from selling equity on the capital markets, the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets could limit potential lenders\u2019 ability to provide funds for the financing of the Net-Zero 1 Project or the terms of any finance transactions could be worse than anticipated. In addition, the effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of COVID-19 could have a material impact on demand for our business. Further, steps taken by market counterparties such as commercial airlines could have an impact on their ability to perform under agreements to which we are a party, which could impact our business. For example, in connection with the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the economy and on the resulting disruption to the airline industry specifically, we and Delta amended portions of our previously disclosed Fuel Sales Agreement in April 2020. Other commercial counterparties may also seek to amend supply agreements in the future as a result of COVID-19 or other similar pandemics. The full extent of the impact and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations remain uncertain at this time.\nWe have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $40.2 million and $28.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $498.2 million. We expect to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future. We currently derive limited revenue primarily from the sale of products produced at the South Hampton Facility although over certain periods of time we have ceased production at the South Hampton Facility due to a lack of isobutanol required to produce hydrocarbon products.\nFurthermore, we expect to spend significant amounts on the further development and commercial implementation of our technology.\nWe also expect to spend significant amounts on developing and financing the Net-Zero 1 Project and other similar growth projects, on marketing, general and administrative expenses associated with our planned growth, on management of operations as a public company and on debt service obligations. In addition, the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights and defending ourselves against claims by others that we may be violating their intellectual property rights may be significant.\nIn particular, over time, costs related to defending the validity of our issued patents and challenging the validity of the patents of others at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may be significant. As a result, even if our revenues increase substantially, we expect that our expenses will exceed revenues for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to achieve profitability during the foreseeable future and may never achieve it. If we fail to achieve profitability, or if the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate, we may not be able to continue our business. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur business is capital-intensive in nature and we rely on external financing to fund our growth strategy, including the development and construction of the Net-Zero 1 Project and other similar growth projects. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are in a capital-intensive business and we rely heavily on external financing for the costs of development and construction of our growth projects, such as the Net-Zero 1 Project, and other projected capital expenditures. Completion of our growth projects will require significant capital expenditures and construction costs. The recovery of the capital investment in our growth projects will generally occur over a long period of time. As a result, we must obtain funds from external sources to help develop and construct our existing project pipeline, to help finance the acquisition of system components, to help identify and develop new projects, to help fund research and development expenses and to help pay the general and administrative costs of operating our business. We may not be able to obtain the needed funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we could be required to delay development and construction of projects, reduce the scope of, abandon or sell some or all of our growth projects or default on our contractual commitments in the future, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur proposed growth projects may not be completed or, if completed, may not perform as expected. Our project development activities may consume a significant portion of our management\u2019s focus, and if not successful, reduce our profitability.\nWe plan to grow our business by building multiple production facilities that will require project development. The development projects are expected to include greenfield and brownfield projects. Development projects require us to spend significant sums for engineering, permitting, legal, financial advisory and other expenses before we determine whether a development project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.\nOur development projects are typically planned to be large and complex, and we may not be able to complete them. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the required agreements, overcome any local opposition, or obtain the necessary licenses, permits and financing. Failure to achieve any of these elements may prevent the development and construction of a project. If that were to occur, we could lose all of our investment in development expenditures and may be required to write-off project development assets.\nWe may be unable to successfully perform under current or future supply and distribution agreements to provide our isobutanol, SAF and other renewable hydrocarbon products, which could harm our commercial prospects.\nWe have entered into several supply agreements pursuant to which we agreed to supply an aggregate of approximately 45 MGPY of SAF, renewable premium gasoline and other renewable hydrocarbon products. Under certain of these supply agreements, the purchasers agreed to pay for and receive, or cause to be received by a third party, or pay for even if not taken, the renewable hydrocarbon products under contract (a \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d arrangement). The timing and volume commitment of certain of these agreements are conditioned upon, and subject to, our ability to complete the construction of a new or expanded production facility (the \u201cExpanded Facility\u201d). In order to commence construction of and complete the Expanded Facility, we must secure third party financing. While we believe that we can secure adequate financing in order to commence construction of and complete the Expanded Facility and, in turn, perform under these agreements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, we have not demonstrated that we can meet the production levels and specifications contemplated in certain of our current supply agreements, and we may enter into additional supply agreements in the future with similar production and specification level requirements. If our production scale-up proceeds more slowly than we expect, or if we encounter difficulties in successfully completing the Expanded Facility, our counterparties may terminate our existing supply agreements and potential customers may be less willing to negotiate definitive supply agreements, or demand terms less favorable to us, and our performance may suffer.\nOur take-or-pay contracts, including our take-or-pay purchase agreement with Trafigura, are subject to significant conditions precedent and, as a result, the revenues that we expect from such contracts may never be realized.\nOur ability to realize revenue under our take-or-pay-contracts, including our take-or-pay purchase agreement with Trafigura, is not guaranteed and is subject to significant conditions precedent. In order to actually realize revenue under such contracts, we are required to, among other things, complete the Expanded Facility or acquire, construct or retrofit a facility at another suitable location, which is, in turn, dependent on our ability to secure the requisite financing. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all, the revenues under such contracts may never be achieved. Our ability to obtain adequate financing will depend on, among other things, the status of our product development, our financial condition and general conditions in the capital, financial and debt markets at the time such financing is sought. In addition, any further common stock, warrant or convertible debt financings could result in the dilution of ownership interests of our then-current stockholders. Furthermore, even if we are able to satisfy all conditions precedent to our take-or-pay contracts, including completion of the Expanded Facility or acquiring, constructing or retrofitting a facility at another suitable location, and securing adequate funding, we still may never realize the full amount of revenue that we expect or project to earn from such contracts. In any event, failure to realize the expected revenue thereunder would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity.\nThe Luverne Facility is our first commercial isobutanol and ethanol production facility, and, as such, we may be unable to produce planned quantities of isobutanol, SAF and renewable premium gasoline and any such production may be costlier than we anticipate.\nSince commencing initial startup operations for the production of isobutanol at the Luverne Facility in May 2012, we have encountered some production challenges, including contamination issues, which have resulted in lower than planned isobutanol production. While we were able to resume production of isobutanol at the Luverne Facility, this is our first commercial isobutanol production facility and we may encounter further production challenges at the Luverne Facility or at our planned Net-Zero 1 Project, including, but not limited to, being unable to manage plant contamination, and we may add additional processing steps or incur additional capital expenditures to achieve our target customers\u2019 product specifications and/or to increase production levels at the Luverne Facility our the planned Net-Zero 1 Project.\nThe Luverne Facility has the capability to produce low-carbon ethanol side-by-side with low-carbon isobutanol. With certain capital improvements, the Luverne Facility could also produce SAF, renewable premium gasoline and other related renewable hydrocarbon products that can be made from isobutanol.\nIn addition, if we decide to utilize the Luverne Facility for production of our products, it is important to note that the Luverne Facility was constructed in 1998. As an older production facility, the Luverne Facility may be more susceptible to maintenance issues that result in production challenges than newer production facilities. Any such production challenges may delay our ramp up of production capacity, prevent us from producing significant quantities of isobutanol, significantly increase our cost to produce isobutanol or cause us to switch to producing ethanol or produce both products simultaneously, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price of corn and other feedstocks may affect our cost structure.\nOur approach to the renewable fuels and chemicals markets will be dependent on the price of corn and other feedstocks that will be used to produce isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol. A decrease in the availability of plant feedstocks or an increase in the price may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. At certain levels, prices may make these products uneconomical to use and produce as we may be unable to pass the full amount of feedstock cost increases on to our customers.\nThe price and availability of corn and other plant feedstocks may be influenced by general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include weather conditions, farming decisions, government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global demand and supply. For example, corn prices may increase significantly in response to drought conditions in the midwestern region of the U.S. and any resulting decrease in the supply of corn could lead to the restriction of corn supplies, which in turn could cause further increases in the price of corn. The significance and relative impact of these factors on the price of plant feedstocks is difficult to predict, especially without knowing what types of plant feedstock materials we may need to use.\nFluctuations in the price and availability of energy to power our production facilities may harm our performance.\nOur production facilities use significant amounts of electricity and natural gas to produce our products. Accordingly, our business is dependent upon electricity and natural gas supplied by third parties. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions are affected by factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions and governmental regulations. Should the price of natural gas increase, our performance could suffer. Likewise, disruptions in the supply of natural gas could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in petroleum prices and customer demand patterns may reduce demand for renewable fuels and bio-based chemicals.\nWe anticipate marketing our renewable fuels as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, if the price of oil falls, any revenues that we generate from renewable fuel products could decline and we may be unable to produce products that are a commercially viable alternative to petroleum-based fuels. Additionally, demand for liquid transportation fuels, including renewable fuels, may decrease due to economic conditions or otherwise, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which individuals are travelling substantially less than prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will encounter similar risks in the chemicals industry, where declines in the price of oil may make petroleum-based hydrocarbons less expensive, which could reduce the competitiveness of our bio-based alternatives.\nChanges in the prices of distillers grains and iDGs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe sell distillers grains as a co-product from the production of ethanol at the Luverne Facility during any period in which the production of isobutanol is temporarily paused and our management decides that the Luverne Facility will be temporarily reverted to ethanol production, or during periods in which we produce both isobutanol and ethanol simultaneously. We may also sell distillers grains produced by other ethanol facilities that we acquire, enter into a joint venture or tolling arrangement with, or license to in the future. We also sell the iDGs that are produced as a co-product of our commercial isobutanol production. Distillers grains and iDGs compete with other animal feed products and decreases in the prices of these other products could decrease the demand for and price of distillers grains and iDGs. Additionally, we have produced limited quantities of commercial iDGs and, as such, there is a risk that our iDGs may not meet market requirements. If the price of distillers grains and iDGs decreases or our iDGs do not meet market requirements, our revenue from the sale of distillers grains and future revenue from the sale of iDGs could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we elect to we produce ethanol rather than isobutanol, or during periods in which we make the strategic decision to revert to ethanol production, or produce both products simultaneously, we will be vulnerable to fluctuations in the price of and cost to produce ethanol.\nIn certain cases, we may obtain income the production of ethanol. Further, we have designed our isobutanol production technology (including the upgrade of the Luverne Facility) to allow us to produce ethanol and isobutanol simultaneously or to produce just ethanol or just isobutanol depending on market conditions. Our earnings from ethanol revenue, if any, will be dependent on the price of, demand for and cost to produce ethanol. Decreases in the price of ethanol, as have been experienced during 2020 and in early 2021, whether caused by decreases in gasoline prices, changes in regulations, seasonal fluctuations or otherwise, will reduce our revenues, while increases in the cost of production will reduce our margins. To the extent that ethanol production costs increase or price decreases, earnings from ethanol production, if any, could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSustained narrow commodity margins for ethanol caused us to operate at a loss and caused us to terminate production at the Luverne Facility. Wemay or may not be able to recommence production when margins improve.\nOur results from operations will be substantially dependent on commodity prices. Many of the risks associated with volatile commodity prices, including fluctuations in feedstock costs and natural gas costs, apply to the production of isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol. Sustained unfavorable commodity prices, as have been experienced during 2020 and in early 2021, have and may in the future cause our combined revenues from sales of ethanol, isobutanol and related co-products to decline below our marginal cost of production. As market conditions change, our management has from time-to-time decided to terminate, reduce or suspend production of isobutanol and/or ethanol at the Luverne Facility and may do so in the future. Currently, ethanol production is terminated indefinitely at the Luverne Facility.\nThe decision to terminate, reduce or suspend production at a facility may create additional costs related to continued maintenance, termination of staff, certain unavoidable fixed costs, termination of customer contracts and increased costs to increase or recommence production in the future. These costs may make it difficult or impractical to increase or recommence production of isobutanol and/or ethanol at the Luverne Facility even if margins improve. In addition, any reduction or suspension of the production of isobutanol and/or ethanol at the Luverne Facility may slow or stop our commercialization process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in the development of individual steps in the production of commercial quantities of isobutanol or renewable hydrocarbon products from plant feedstocks in a timely or economic manner, or at all.\nAs of the date of this Report, we have produced only limited quantities of isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products at commercial scale. We may not be successful in increasing our production of isobutanol or renewable hydrocarbon products.\nOur future success depends on our ability to produce commercial quantities of low-carbon isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products in a timely and economic manner. While we have produced isobutanol using our biocatalysts at the Luverne Facility in commercial-scale fermenters, our biocatalysts have not yet produced isobutanol at fully optimized levels in fermenters typical of full scale operation at a large commercial facility. The risk of contamination and other problems rises as we increase the scale of our isobutanol production. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we may encounter difficulties in achieving our target isobutanol production yield, rate, concentration or purity at a commercial scale, which could delay or increase the costs involved in commercializing our isobutanol production.\nThe technological and logistical challenges associated with producing, marketing, selling and distributing isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol are extraordinary, and we may not be able to resolve any difficulties that arise in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all.\nPrior to our purchase of the Luverne Facility, we had never operated or built (through Retrofit or otherwise) a commercial isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon or ethanol facility. We believe that we understand the engineering and process characteristics necessary to successfully build the additional facilities that we are contemplating and to scale up to larger facilities. We expect to incur additional capital expenditures to increase production of low-carbon isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products at our Net-Zero 1 Project and potentially also at the Luverne Facility. Our assumptions, however, may prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we can consistently produce low-carbon isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products or ethanol in an economical manner in commercial quantities. If we fail to consistently produce low-carbon isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and/or ethanol economically on a commercial scale or in commercial volumes, our commercialization of low-carbon isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur actual costs may be greater than expected in developing our growth projects, causing us to realize significantly lower profits or losses on our projects.\nWe generally must estimate the costs of completing a specific project to prior to the construction of the project. The actual cost of labor and materials may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These variations may cause gross profit for a project to differ from those we originally estimated. Cost overruns on our growth projects could occur due to changes in a variety of factors such as:\n\u25cf Failure to properly estimate costs of engineering, materials, equipment or labor;\n\u25cf Unanticipated technical problems with the structures, materials or services;\n\u25cf Unanticipated project modifications;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the costs of equipment, materials, labor or contractors;\n\u25cf Our suppliers or contractors failure to perform;\n\u25cf Changes in local laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf Delays caused by weather conditions.\nAs projects grow in size and complexity, multiple factors may contribute to reduced profit or losses, and depending on the size of the particular project, variations from the estimated project costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if project costs exceed our estimates it could causing us to realize significantly lower profits or losses on our projects.\nOur facilities and processes may fail to produce products at the volumes, rates and costs we expect.\nSome or all of our future production facilities may be in locations distant from corn or other feedstock sources, which could increase our feedstock costs or prevent us from acquiring sufficient feedstock volumes for commercial production. General market conditions might also cause increases in feedstock prices, which could likewise increase our production costs.\nEven if we secure access to sufficient volumes of feedstock, our production facilities may fail to perform as expected. The equipment and subsystems that we install in our production facilities may never operate as planned. Our systems may prove incompatible with the original facility or require additional modification after installation. Unexpected problems may force us to cease or delay production and the time and costs involved with such delays may prove prohibitive. Any or all of these risks could prevent us from achieving the production throughput and yields necessary to achieve our target annualized production run rates and/or to meet the volume demands or minimum requirements of our customers, including pursuant to definitive supply or distribution agreements that we may enter into, which may subject us to monetary damages. Failure to achieve these rates or meet these minimum requirements, or achieving them only after significant additional expenditures, could substantially harm our commercial performance.\nWe may be unable to produce isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products like SAF or other products in accordance with customer specifications.\nEven if we produce isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products like SAF or other products at our targeted rates, we may be unable to produce these products to meet customer specifications, including those defined in ASTM D7862 \u201cStandard Specification for Butanol for Blending with Gasoline for Use as Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel,\" ASTM D7566 \u201cStandard Specifications for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons\u201d or specifications to carbon intensity standards. We may need to add additional processing steps or incur capital expenditures in order to meet customer specifications which could add significant costs to our production process. If we fail to meet specific product or volume specifications contained in a supply agreement, the customer may have the right to seek an alternate supply of isobutanol or renewable hydrocarbon products and/or terminate the agreement completely, and we could be required to pay shortfall fees or otherwise be subject to damages. A failure to successfully meet the specifications of our potential customers could decrease demand and significantly hinder market adoption of our products.\nWe lack significant experience operating commercial-scale isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon and ethanol facilities and may encounter substantial difficulties operating commercial plants or expanding our business.\nWe have very limited experience operating commercial-scale isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon and ethanol facilities concurrently. Accordingly, we may encounter significant difficulties operating at a commercial scale once we expand our production capabilities, including at our Net-Zero 1 Project. In addition, we believe that certain of our future facilities, like the Luverne Facility, could be able to continue producing ethanol during much of the Retrofit process if we elect to produce ethanol. If we elect to produce ethanol, we will need to successfully administer and manage this production. Although the employees at the Luverne Facility are experienced in the operation of ethanol facilities, and our future development partners or the entities that we acquire may likewise have such experience, we may be unable to manage ethanol-producing operations, especially given the possible complications associated with a simultaneous Retrofit. Once we complete a commercial Retrofit, operational difficulties may increase, because neither we nor anyone else has significant experience operating a pure isobutanol fermentation facility at a commercial scale. The skills and knowledge gained in operating commercial ethanol facilities or small-scale isobutanol plants may prove insufficient for successful operation of a large-scale isobutanol and hydrocarbon facility or the Expanded Facility, and we may be required to expend significant time and money to develop our capabilities in isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon facility operation. We may also need to hire new employees or contract with third parties to help manage our operations, and our performance will suffer if we are unable to hire qualified parties or if they perform poorly.\nWe may face additional operational difficulties as we further expand our production capacity, including the Expanded Facility. Integrating new facilities with our existing operations may prove difficult. Rapid growth, resulting from our operation of, or other involvement with, isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon facilities or otherwise, may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. To effectively manage our growth and execute our expansion plans, we will need to expand our administrative and operational resources substantially and attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, technicians and other personnel. We may be unable to do so. Failure to meet the operational challenges of developing and managing increased production of isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and/or ethanol, or failure to otherwise manage our growth, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty adapting our technology to commercial-scale fermentation, which could delay or prevent our commercialization of SAF and renewable premium gasoline.\nWhile we have demonstrated some ability to produce isobutanol under the demonstration plant operating conditions and under commercial scale operating conditions at the Luverne Facility, and we have succeeded in reaching our commercial fermentation performance targets for isobutanol concentration, fermentation productivity and isobutanol yield in laboratory tests, we have not yet reached all performance targets in a commercial plant environment at the larger scale we contemplate constructing at the Expanded Facility involving multiple fermenters. Ultimately, our yeast biocatalyst may not be able to meet the commercial performance targets in a timely manner, or ever. In addition, the risk of contamination and other problems may increase as we seek to ramp up our production capacity, which could negatively impact our cost of production or require additional capital expenditures to solve for these problems. If we encounter difficulties in optimizing our production, our commercialization of isobutanol, SAF, renewable premium gasoline and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulties gaining market acceptance and successfully marketing our isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products to customers, including chemical producers, fuel distributors and refiners.\nA key component of our business strategy is to market our isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products to chemical producers, fuels distributors, refiners and other fuel and chemical industry market participants. We have limited experience marketing isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products on a commercial scale and we may fail to successfully negotiate marketing agreements in a timely manner or on favorable terms. If we fail to successfully market our isobutanol or renewable hydrocarbon products to refiners, fuels distributors, chemical producers and others, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nA very limited market currently exists for isobutanol as a fuel or as a gasoline blendstock. Therefore, to gain market acceptance and successfully market our isobutanol to fuels distributors and refiners, we must effectively demonstrate the commercial advantages of using isobutanol over other renewable fuels and blendstocks, as well as our ability to produce isobutanol reliably on a commercial scale at a sufficiently low cost. We must show that isobutanol is compatible with existing infrastructure and does not damage pipes, engines, storage facilities or pumps. We must also overcome marketing and lobbying efforts by producers of other renewable fuels and blendstocks, including ethanol, many of whom may have greater resources than we do. If the markets for isobutanol as a fuel or as a gasoline blendstock do not develop as we currently anticipate, or if we are unable to penetrate these markets successfully, our revenue and growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also intend to market our isobutanol to chemical producers for use in making various chemicals such as isobutylene, a type of butene that can be produced through the dehydration of isobutanol. Although a significant market currently exists for isobutylene produced from petroleum, which is widely used in the production of plastics, specialty chemicals, alkylate for gasoline blending and high octane aviation gasoline, no one has successfully created isobutylene on a commercial scale from bio-isobutanol. Therefore, to gain market acceptance and successfully market our isobutanol to chemical producers, we must show that our isobutanol can be converted into isobutylene at a commercial scale. As no company currently dehydrates commercial volumes of isobutanol into isobutylene, we must demonstrate the large-scale feasibility of the process and potentially reach agreements with companies that are willing to invest in the necessary dehydration infrastructure. Failure to reach favorable agreements with these companies, or the inability of their plants to convert isobutanol into isobutylene at sufficient scale, may slow our development in the chemicals market and could significantly affect our profitability.\nObtaining market acceptance in the chemicals industry is complicated by the fact that many potential chemicals industry customers have invested substantial amounts of time and money in developing petroleum-based production channels. These potential customers generally have well-developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of chemical components and may display substantial resistance to changing these processes. Pre-existing contractual commitments, unwillingness to invest in new infrastructure, distrust of new production methods and lengthy relationships with current suppliers may all slow market acceptance of isobutanol.\nWe believe that consumer demand for environmentally sensitive products will drive demand among large brand owners for isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and low-carbon ethanol. One of our marketing strategies is to leverage this demand to obtain commitments from large brand owners to purchase our products. We believe these commitments will, in turn, promote chemicals industry demand for our isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products. If consumer demand for environmentally sensitive products fails to develop at sufficient scale or if such demand fails to drive large brand owners to seek sources of renewable isobutanol or renewable hydrocarbon products, our revenue and growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulties scaling up our renewable hydrocarbon technology, and, as such, we may be unable to produce commercial quantities of our renewable hydrocarbon products and any such production may be costlier than we anticipate.\nWe have developed the South Hampton Facility in Silsbee, Texas in partnership with South Hampton Resources. Currently, the South Hampton Facility can produce approximately 100,000 gallons of renewable hydrocarbon products from our renewable isobutanol for use as fuels and chemicals. We have demonstrated the ability to convert our isobutanol at this level into products such as SAF, isooctane, isooctene and par-xylene.\nThe production and sale of commercial volumes of renewable hydrocarbon products, such as SAF, isooctane and isooctene, produced from our isobutanol is an important part of our business plans. However, we may encounter challenges in scaling up our process to convert isobutanol into renewable hydrocarbon products successfully. In addition, the cost to construct commercial hydrocarbons facilities or the production costs associated with the operation of such facilities may be higher than we project. If we encounter such difficulties, this may significantly impact the development of the markets for our renewable hydrocarbon products, impact performance under our supply agreements and could significantly affect our profitability.\nWe may be reliant on Butamax to develop certain markets for isobutanol.\nAs part of the License Agreement entered into with Butamax, it was agreed that Butamax would take the lead in developing the markets for on-road gasoline blendstocks. This would entail progressing the required approvals for these markets, as well as managing the marketing and distribution of our isobutanol and our potential licensee\u2019s isobutanol in these markets beyond certain minimum volumes. On June 12, 2018, the EPA announced that it approved the registration of isobutanol as a fuel additive for blending into gasoline at levels up to 16 volume percent for on-road automotive use. If Butamax is unable to maintain or obtain the necessary approvals to sell isobutanol into the on-road gasoline blendstock markets, or if it is unsuccessful in building market demand for isobutanol as an on-road gasoline blendstock, our revenue and growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be required to pay Butamax royalties for selling isobutanol into certain markets, which could hinder our ability to competitively sell our isobutanol into those markets.\nAs part of the License Agreement entered into with Butamax, it was agreed that we, and our potential licensees, may be required to pay Butamax royalties for selling isobutanol into the on-road gasoline blendstock markets and the chemical isobutylene applications markets beyond certain minimum volumes. The addition of these royalties may make our isobutanol uncompetitive from a price perspective, which may hinder our ability to sell into these markets. If this is the case, our revenue and growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nEven if we are successful in consistently producing isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon products on a commercial scale, we may not be successful in negotiating additional supply agreements or pricing terms to support the growth of our business.\nWe expect that many of our customers will be large companies with extensive experience operating in the fuels or chemicals markets. As an early stage company, we lack significant commercial operating experience, and may face difficulties in developing marketing expertise in these fields. Our business model relies upon our ability to successfully negotiate and structure long-term supply agreements for the isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and other products we produce and to negotiate pricing terms that generate positive results from our production operations. Certain agreements with existing and potential customers may initially only provide for the purchase of limited quantities from us. Our ability to increase our sales will depend in large part upon our ability to expand these existing customer relationships into long-term supply agreements. Maintaining and expanding our existing relationships and establishing new ones can require substantial investment without any assurance from customers that they will place significant orders. In addition, many of our potential customers may be more experienced in these matters than we are, and we may fail to successfully negotiate these agreements in a timely manner or on favorable terms which, in turn, may force us to slow our production, dedicate additional resources to increasing our storage capacity and/or dedicate resources to sales in spot markets. Furthermore, should we become more dependent on spot market sales, our profitability will become increasingly vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in the price and demand for petroleum-based fuels and competing substitutes.\nOur isobutanol may be less compatible with existing refining and transportation infrastructure than we believe, which may hinder our ability to market our product on a large scale.\nWe developed our business model based on our belief that our isobutanol is fully compatible with existing refinery infrastructure. For example, when making isobutanol blends, we believe that gasoline refineries will be able to pump our isobutanol through their pipes and blend it in their existing facilities without damaging their equipment. If our isobutanol proves unsuitable for such handling, it will be more expensive for refiners to use our isobutanol than we anticipate, and they may be less willing to adopt it as a gasoline blendstock, forcing us to seek alternative purchasers.\nLikewise, our plans for marketing our isobutanol are based upon our belief that it will be compatible with the pipes, tanks and other infrastructure currently used for transporting, storing and distributing gasoline. If our isobutanol or products incorporating our isobutanol cannot be transported with this equipment, we will be forced to seek alternative transportation arrangements, which will make our isobutanol and products produced from our isobutanol more expensive to transport and less appealing to potential customers. Reduced compatibility with either refinery or transportation infrastructure may slow or prevent market adoption of our isobutanol, which could substantially harm our performance.\nA sustained low oil price environment may negatively impact the price we receive for the sale of our isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol.\nMany of our end-products such as isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol have some level of price correlation with crude oil. If crude oil prices were to remain at low levels over a sustained period of time, this may have an impact on the pricing that we are able to achieve in the marketplace for many of those end-products. This may cause us to operate at a lower, or negative, operating margin and, as a result, our management may decide to terminate, reduce or suspend production of isobutanol and/or ethanol at the Luverne Facility. Unfavorable operating margins may also impact our ability to enter into commercial agreements with development partners or licensees.\nIf we engage in acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may acquire businesses, assets, technologies or products to enhance our business in the future. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could, subject to certain limitations in the agreements governing our indebtedness at such time:\n\u25cf\nissue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders;\n\u25cf\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; or\n\u25cf\nassume significant known or unknown liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective partners, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. Other than our acquisition of the Luverne Facility, we have not engaged in acquisitions in the past, and do not have experience in managing the integration process. Therefore, we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we engage in joint ventures, we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may enter into joint ventures with the owners of existing ethanol production facilities in order to acquire access to additional isobutanol production capacity and hydrocarbon production capabilities. We currently anticipate that in each such joint venture, the ethanol producer would contribute access to its existing ethanol production facility and we would be responsible for Retrofitting such facility to produce isobutanol and/or hydrocarbon products. Upon completion of the Retrofit, and in some cases the attainment of certain performance targets, both parties to the joint venture would receive a portion of the profits from the sale of isobutanol or hydrocarbon products , consistent with our business model. In connection with these joint ventures, we could incur substantial debt to fund the Retrofit of the accessed facilities and we could assume significant liabilities.\nRealizing the anticipated benefits of joint ventures, including projected increases to production capacity and additional revenue opportunities, involves a number of potential challenges. The failure to meet these challenges could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. Joint ventures are complex and time consuming and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs related to such arrangements, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties negotiating joint venture agreements with favorable terms and establishing relevant performance metrics;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties completing the Retrofits of the accessed facilities using our integrated fermentation technology;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to meet applicable performance targets related to the production of isobutanol and hydrocarbons;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties obtaining the permits and approvals required to produce and sell our products in different geographic areas;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities associated with managing the geographic separation of accessed facilities;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to matters related to the joint ventures;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties maintaining effective relationships with personnel from different corporate cultures; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset Retrofit costs.\nAdditionally, we plan to be a leading marketer for all isobutanol and hydrocarbon products produced using our proprietary technology and sold in markets other than on-road gasoline blendstocks including, without limitation, all isobutanol and hydrocarbon products that are produced by any facilities that we access via joint venture. Marketing agreements can be very complex and the obligations that we assume as a leading marketer may be time consuming. We have little experience marketing isobutanol and hydrocarbon products on a commercial scale and we may fail to successfully negotiate marketing agreements in a timely manner or on favorable terms. If we fail to successfully market the isobutanol and hydrocarbon products produced using our proprietary technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur joint venture partners may have significant amounts of existing debt and may not be able to service their existing debt obligations, which could cause the failure of a specific project and the loss by us of any investment we have made to Retrofit the facilities owned by the joint venture partner. In addition, if we are unable to meet specified performance targets related to the production of isobutanol or hydrocarbon products at a facility owned by one of our joint venture partners, we may never become eligible to receive a portion of the profits of the joint venture and may be unable to recover the costs of Retrofitting the facility.\nAdditionally, we plan to be a leading marketer for all isobutanol and hydrocarbon products produced using our proprietary technology and sold in markets other than on-road gasoline blendstocks including, without limitation, all isobutanol and hydrocarbon products that are produced by any facilities that we access via joint venture. Marketing agreements can be very complex and the obligations that we assume as a leading marketer may be time consuming. We have little experience marketing isobutanol and hydrocarbon products on a commercial scale and we may fail to successfully negotiate marketing agreements in a timely manner or on favorable terms. If we fail to successfully market the isobutanol and hydrocarbon products produced using our proprietary technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose key personnel, including key management personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, it could delay our product development programs and harm our research and development efforts, make it more difficult to pursue partnerships or develop our own products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is complex and we intend to target a variety of markets. Therefore, it is critical that our management team and employee workforce are knowledgeable in the areas in which we operate. The departure, illness or absence of any key members of our management, including our named executive officers, or the failure to attract or retain other key employees who possess the requisite expertise for the conduct of our business, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into partnerships or licensing arrangements to execute our business strategy. In addition, the loss of any key scientific staff, or the failure to attract or retain other key scientific employees, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into partnerships or licensing arrangements to execute our business strategy. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology-based businesses, particularly in the advanced renewable fuels area, or due to the limited availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our renewable chemicals and advanced renewable fuels business. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our partners and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs. In particular, our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists. Competition for experienced scientists and other technical personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms. All of our employees are at-will employees, meaning that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time.\nOur planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products and processes developed through our technology platform or acquired through strategic or other transactions, especially in the end markets that we seek to penetrate. These activities will require the addition of new personnel, and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. The inability to attract personnel with appropriate skills or to develop the necessary expertise could impair our ability to grow our business.\nWe may face substantial competition from companies with greater resources and financial strength, which could adversely affect our performance and growth.\nWe may face substantial competition in the markets for isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products, polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers, other polymers and ethanol. Our competitors include companies in the incumbent petroleum-based industry as well as those in the nascent renewable fuels industry. The incumbent petroleum-based industry benefits from a large established infrastructure, production capability and business relationships. The incumbents\u2019 greater resources and financial strength provide significant competitive advantages that we may not be able to overcome in a timely manner. Academic and government institutions may also develop technologies which will compete with us in the chemicals, solvents and blendstock markets.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to and/or are less expensive than other products on the market. Many of our competitors have substantially greater production, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. In addition, certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation. Furthermore, to secure purchase agreements from certain customers, we may be required to enter into exclusive supply contracts, which could limit our ability to further expand our sales to new customers. Likewise, major potential customers may be locked into long-term, exclusive agreements with our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to compete for their business.\nIn addition, various governments have recently announced a number of spending programs focused on the development of clean technologies, including alternatives to petroleum-based fuels and the reduction of carbon emissions. Such spending programs could lead to increased funding for our competitors or a rapid increase in the number of competitors within those markets.\nWe also may face substantial competition as we develop our RNG projects and seek to work with farmers and landowners to source our biogas feedstock and lease land to install and operate RNG processing facilities. Our competitors include established companies and developers with significantly greater resources and financial strength, which may provide them with competitive advantages that we may not be able to overcome in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures. This failure could reduce our competitiveness and market share, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and prevent us from obtaining or maintaining profitability.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances.\nThe renewable fuels industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. Technological development by others may impact the competitiveness of our products in the marketplace. Competitors and potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or may use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense.\nWe may face significant and substantial competition as it relates to our proprietary renewable fuels which could adversely affect our performance and growth.\nRenewable fuels companies may provide substantial competition in the renewable hydrocarbons market. With respect to production of renewable gasoline, renewable fuels competitors are numerous and include both large established companies and numerous startups. For example, Virent Energy Systems, Inc. has developed a process for making gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. Many other competitors may do so as well. In the SAF fuel market, we will face competition from companies such as Neste Corporation, Synthetic Genomics, Inc., and Exxon-Mobil Corporation that are pursuing production of SAF from algae-based technology. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. and others are also targeting production of SAF fuels from vegetable oils and animal fats. Red Rock Biofuels, Fulcom BioEnergy, Inc. and others are planning to produce SAF fuel from renewable biomass. We may also face competition from companies working to produce jet fuel from hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters. In the diesel fuels market, competitors such as Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. have developed technologies for production of alternative hydrocarbon diesel fuel.\nIn the production of other renewable fuels, including our renewable hydrocarbon products, key competitors include Shell Oil Company, POET, LLC, ICM, Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Company, Zea 2 LLC, Iogen Corporation and many smaller startup companies. If these companies are successful in establishing low cost cellulosic ethanol or other fuel production, it could negatively impact the market for our isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock. In the markets for the hydrocarbon fuels that we plan to produce from our isobutanol, we will face competition from the incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry. The incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry makes the vast majority of the world\u2019s gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and blendstocks. It is a mature industry with a substantial base of infrastructure for the production and distribution of petroleum-derived products. The size, established infrastructure and significant resources of many companies in this industry may put us at a substantial competitive disadvantage and delay or prevent the establishment and growth of our business in the market for hydrocarbon fuels.\nIn the production of isobutanol, we face competition from Butamax. Additionally, a number of companies including Cathay Industrial Biotech, Ltd., METabolic EXplorer, S.A. and Eastman Chemical Company are developing n-butanol production capability from a variety of renewable feedstocks.\nIn the gasoline blendstock market, we will compete with our isobutanol against renewable ethanol producers (including those working to produce ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks), producers of alkylate from petroleum and producers of other blendstocks, all of whom may reduce our ability to obtain market share or maintain our price levels. If any of these competitors succeed in producing blendstocks more efficiently, in higher volumes or offering superior performance than our isobutanol, our financial performance may suffer. Furthermore, if our competitors have more success marketing their products or reaching development or supply agreements with major customers, our competitive position may also be harmed.\nIn the ethanol market, we operate in a highly competitive industry in the U.S. According to the BBI International, there are over 200 ethanol facilities in the U.S. with an installed nameplate capacity of over 16 billion gallons. Some of the key competitors in the U.S. include Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Green Plains, Inc., POET, LLC and Valero Energy Corporation. We also face competition from foreign producers of ethanol. Brazil is believed to be the world\u2019s second largest ethanol producing country. Many producers have much larger production capacities and operate at a lower cost of production than we do. As a result, these companies may be able to compete more effectively in narrower commodity margin environments.\nOur competitive position in the polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers markets versus the incumbent petroleum-derived products and other renewable butanol producers may not be favorable.\nIn the polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers markets, we face competition from incumbent petroleum-derived products, other renewable isobutanol producers and renewable n-butanol producers. Our competitive position versus the incumbent petroleum-derived products and other renewable butanol producers may not be favorable. Petroleum-derived products have dominated the market for many years and there is substantial existing infrastructure for production from petroleum sources, which may impede our ability to establish a position in these markets. Other isobutanol and n-butanol companies may develop technologies that prove more effective than our isobutanol production technology, or such companies may be more adept at marketing their production. Additionally, one company in France, Global Bioenergies, S.A., is pursuing the production of isobutylene from renewable carbohydrates directly. Since conversion of isobutanol to butenes such as isobutylene is a key step in producing many polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers from our isobutanol, this direct production of renewable isobutylene, if successful, could limit our opportunities in these markets.\nIn the polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers markets, we expect to face vigorous competition from existing technologies. The companies we may compete with may have significantly greater access to resources, far more industry experience and/or more established sales and marketing networks. Additionally, since we do not plan to produce most of these products directly, we will depend on the willingness of potential customers to purchase and convert our isobutanol into their products. These potential customers generally have well-developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may have a resistance to changing these processes and components. These potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers, influenced by consumer preference, manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components, supplier operating history, regulatory issues, product liability and other factors, many of which are unknown to, or not well understood by, us. Satisfying these processes may take many months or years. If we are unable to convince these potential customers that our isobutanol is comparable or superior to the alternatives that they currently use, we will not be successful in entering these markets and our business will be adversely affected.\nBusiness interruptions, including those related to COVID-19, may have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations, such as riots, civil disturbances, war, terrorist acts, pandemics, such as COVID-19, floods, infections in our laboratory or production facilities or those of our contract manufacturers and other events beyond our control. We do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan. In addition, we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and success as an overall business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures or a cyber-attack.\nOur business is dependent on proprietary technologies, processes and information that we have developed, much of which is stored on our computer systems. We also have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) services in connection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our vendors protect networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism, theft, malware, ransomware and phishing attacks. Any of these and other events could result in IT system failures, delays, a material disruption of our business or increases in capital expenses. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment and IT systems and software, as well as preemptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures.\nFurthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. While we have implemented security resources to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Significant disruption to our IT system or breaches of data security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may engage in hedging transactions, which could harm our business.\nIn the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to offset some of the effects of volatility in commodity prices. Hedging activities may cause us to suffer losses, such as if we purchase a position in a declining market or sell a position in a rising market. Furthermore, hedging would expose us to the risk that we may have under- or over-estimated our need for a specific commodity or that the other party to a hedging contract may default on its obligation. If there are significant swings in commodity prices, or if we purchase more corn for future delivery than we can process, we may have to pay to terminate a futures contract, resell unneeded corn inventory at a loss, or produce our products at a loss, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We may vary the hedging strategies we undertake, which could leave us more vulnerable to increases in commodity prices or decreases in the prices of isobutanol, distillers grains, iDGs or ethanol. Future losses from hedging activities and changes in hedging strategy could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nEthical, legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes, and similar concerns about feedstocks grown on land that could be used for food production, could limit or prevent the use of our products, processes and technologies and limit our revenues.\nSome of our processes involve the use of genetically engineered organisms or genetic engineering technologies. Additionally, our feedstocks may be grown on land that could be used for food production, which subjects our feedstock sources to \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d concerns. If we are not able to overcome the ethical, legal and social concerns relating to genetic engineering or food versus fuel, our products and processes may not be accepted. Any of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses, delays or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions.\nOur ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our technologies, products or processes could be limited by the following factors:\n\u25cf\npublic attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and genetically engineered products and processes, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u25cf\npublic attitudes regarding and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material, which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage others from supporting, developing or commercializing our products, processes and technologies;\n\u25cf\npublic attitudes and ethical concerns surrounding production of feedstocks on land which could be used to grow food, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically engineered organisms, which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products; and\n\u25cf\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning feedstocks produced on land which could be used to grow food, which could result in greater government regulation of feedstock sources.\nThe subjects of genetically engineered organisms and food versus fuel have received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically engineered products or feedstocks grown on land suitable for food production.\nThe biocatalysts that we develop have significantly enhanced characteristics compared to those found in naturally occurring enzymes or microbes. While we produce our biocatalysts only for use in a controlled industrial environment, the release of such biocatalysts into uncontrolled environments could have unintended consequences. Any adverse effect resulting from such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, and we may be exposed to liability for any resulting harm.\nAs isobutanol, SAF and renewable premium gasoline has not previously been used as a commercial fuel in significant amounts, its use subjects us to product liability risks.\nIsobutanol, SAF and renewable premium gasoline have not been used as a commercial fuel in large quantities or for a long period of time. Research regarding these products and its distribution infrastructure is ongoing. Although isobutanol, SAF and renewable premium gasolines have been tested on some engines, there is a risk that they may damage engines or otherwise fail to perform as expected. If these products degrade the performance or reduce the lifecycle of engines, or cause them to fail to meet emissions standards, market acceptance could be slowed or stopped, and we could be subject to product liability claims. A significant product liability lawsuit could substantially impair our production efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to use some or all of our net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future income.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses generated before January 1, 2021, which if not utilized will begin to expire at various times over the next 20 years. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, these carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or net operating losses, to offset future taxable income. We undertook a detailed study of our net operating loss carryforwards through July 9, 2020 to determine whether such amounts are likely to be limited by Section 382 of the Code. As a result of this analysis, we currently believe any Section 382 of the Code limitations will significantly impact our ability to offset income with available net operating loss carryforwards. We have experienced more than one ownership change in prior years, and the issuance of shares in connection with our initial public offering itself triggered an ownership change. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change, as may future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price.\nWe may enter into letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other largely non-binding agreements with potential customers or partners that may not result in legally binding, definitive agreements.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other largely non-binding agreements or understandings with potential customers or partners in order to develop our business and the markets that we serve. We can make no assurance that legally binding, definitive agreements reflecting the terms of such non-binding agreements will be completed with such customers or partners, or at all.\nCompetitiveness of our products for fuel use depends in part on government economic incentives for renewable energy projects or other related policies that could change.\nWe depend, in part, on international, federal, state and local government incentives, including but not limited to RINs, LCFS credits in California, Clean Fuel Program credits in Oregon, Renewable Energy Credits (\u201cRECs\u201d), rebates, tax credits and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of renewable energy projects, that promote the use of renewable energy. These government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated altogether, or the categories of renewable energy qualifying for such government economic incentives could be changed. These renewable energy program incentives are subject to regulatory oversight and could be administratively or legislatively changed in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Reductions in, changes to, or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives could result in decreased demand for, and lower revenues from, our projects and products.\nIn addition, we may be required to register our projects or qualify our products with the federal government, various states or other countries. Delays in obtaining registration or qualification of our projects or products could delay future revenues and could adversely affect our cash flows. Further, failure of our projects or products to qualify for government economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in defending against any claims by competitors or others that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.\nThe various bioindustrial markets in which we plan to operate are subject to frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, many companies in intellectual property-dependent industries, including the renewable energy industry, have employed intellectual property litigation as a means to gain an advantage over their competitors. As a result, we may be required to defend against claims of intellectual property infringement that may be asserted by our competitors against us and, if the outcome of any such litigation is adverse to us, it may affect our ability to compete effectively.\nLitigation, interferences, opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the U.S. may divert management time from focusing on business operations, could cause us to spend significant amounts of money and may have no guarantee of success. Any future intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nstop selling, incorporating, manufacturing or using our products that use the subject intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nobtain from a third party asserting its intellectual property rights, a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf\nredesign those products or processes, such as our processes for producing isobutanol and ethanol, that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign could be technically infeasible;\n\u25cf\npay attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses; or\n\u25cf\npay damages, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights.\nWe are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by, and issued to, third parties. We cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail if any of this third-party intellectual property is asserted against us.\nOur ability to compete may be adversely affected if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies or if we lose some of our intellectual property rights through costly litigation or administrative proceedings.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property covering our technologies and products and potential products in the U.S. and other countries. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes. We own rights to hundreds of issued patents and filed patent applications in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. When and if issued, patents would expire at the end of their term and any patent would only provide us commercial advantage for a limited period of time, if at all. Our patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and to our methods and products which support our business in the advanced renewable fuels and renewable chemicals markets. We intend to continue to apply for patents relating to our technologies, methods and products as we deem appropriate.\nOnly some of the patent applications that we have filed in the U.S. or in any foreign jurisdictions, and only certain of the patent applications filed by third parties in which we own rights, have been issued. A filed patent application does not guarantee a patent will issue and a patent issuing does not guarantee its validity, nor does it give us the right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to \u201cblocking patents\u201d that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our products or practicing our technology. The scope and validity of patents and success in prosecuting patent applications involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, issuance, coverage and validity cannot be predicted with any certainty. Patents issuing from our filed applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in secret and in territories where we do not have patent protection. Such third parties may then try to sell or import products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other territories and we may be unable to prove that such products were made using our inventions. Additional uncertainty may result from implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, as well as other potential patent reform legislation passed by the U.S. Congress and from legal precedent handed down by the Federal Circuit Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, as they determine legal issues concerning the scope, validity and construction of patent claims. Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, there is additional uncertainty as to the validity of any patents that may issue and the potential for \u201cblocking patents\u201d coming into force at some future date. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that any of our currently filed or future patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, predict the scope of the claims that may issue in our and other companies\u2019 patents. Any proceedings challenging our patents may result in the claims being amended or canceled. If the claims are amended or canceled, the scope of our patent claims may be narrowed, which may reduce the scope of protection afforded by our patent portfolio. Given that the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, we cannot ensure that (i) we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our filed applications, (ii) we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions, (iii) the proprietary technologies we develop will be patentable, (iv) any patents issued will be broad enough in scope to provide commercial advantage and prevent circumvention, and (v) competitors and other parties do not have or will not obtain patent protection that will block our development and commercialization activities.\nThese concerns apply equally to patents we have licensed, which may likewise be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the licensed technologies may be obstructed from commercialization by competitors\u2019 \u201cblocking patents.\u201d In addition, we generally do not control the patent prosecution and maintenance of subject matter that we license from others. Generally, the licensors are primarily or wholly responsible for the patent prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent applications and patents we license, while we may only be afforded opportunities to comment on such activities. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over licensed intellectual property as we exercise over our own intellectual property and we face the risk that our licensors will not prosecute or maintain it as effectively as we would like.\nIn addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly where, as here, the end products reaching the market generally do not reveal the processes used in their manufacture, and particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S., so we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken in obtaining intellectual property and other proprietary rights will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. If competitors are able to use our technology without our authorization, our ability to compete effectively could be adversely affected. Moreover, competitors and other parties such as universities may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies. If that happens, the potential competitive advantages provided by our intellectual property may be adversely affected. We may then need to license these competing technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause material harm to our business. Accordingly, litigation may be necessary for us to assert claims of infringement, enforce patents we own or license, protect trade secrets or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur commercial success also depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and not breaching any licenses or other agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and business. We cannot be certain that patents have not or will not be issued to third parties that could block our ability to obtain patents or to operate our business as we would like, or at all. There may be patents in some countries that, if valid, may block our ability to commercialize products in those countries if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring rights to these patents. There may also be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that, if granted and valid, may also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in these countries if we are unable to circumvent or license them.\nAs is commonplace in the biotechnology industries, some of our directors, employees and consultants are or have been employed at, or associated with, companies and universities that compete with us or have or will develop similar technologies and related intellectual property. While employed at these companies, these employees, directors and consultants may have been exposed to or involved in research and technology similar to the areas of research and technology in which we are engaged. Though we have not received such a complaint, we may be subject to allegations that we, our directors, employees or consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used, misappropriated or disclosed alleged trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information of those companies. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such allegations and the outcome of any such litigation would be uncertain.\nUnder some of our research agreements, our partners share joint rights in certain intellectual property we develop. Such provisions may limit our ability to gain commercial benefit from some of the intellectual property we develop and may lead to costly or time-consuming disputes with parties with whom we have commercial relationships over rights to certain innovations.\nIf any other party has filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention and, thus, the right to the patents for these inventions in the U.S. These proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable. Even if successful, such a proceeding may result in the loss of certain claims. Even successful outcomes of such proceedings could result in significant legal fees and other expenses, diversion of management time and efforts and disruption in our business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any patent or related litigation could harm our ability to compete.\nIf our biocatalysts, or the genes that code for our biocatalysts, are stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, others could use these biocatalysts or genes to produce competing products.\nThird parties, including our contract manufacturers, customers and those involved in shipping our biocatalysts, may have custody or control of our biocatalysts. If our biocatalysts, or the genes that code for our biocatalysts, were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce these biocatalysts for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to discover or challenge this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions, and, particularly as we move forward in our partnerships with Praj and future international partners, we may face new and increased risks and challenges in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights abroad. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to bioindustrial technologies. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Proceedings to enforce our patents and other proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. We require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that know-how and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. Nevertheless, these agreements may not be enforceable, our proprietary information may be disclosed, third parties could reverse engineer our biocatalysts and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, an unauthorized breach in our information technology systems may expose our trade secrets and other proprietary information to unauthorized parties.\nWe have received funding from U.S. government agencies, which could negatively affect our intellectual property rights.\nSome of our research has been funded by grants from U.S. government agencies. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents and technical data, generally including, at a minimum, a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention or technical data for noncommercial purposes. U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions will normally be subject to government license rights, periodic progress reporting, foreign manufacturing restrictions and march-in rights. March-in rights refer to the right of the U.S. government, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant a license to technology developed under a government grant to a responsible applicant or, if we refuse, to grant such a license itself. March-in rights can be triggered if the government determines that we have failed to work sufficiently towards achieving practical application of a technology or if action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. If we breach the terms of our grants, the government may gain rights to the intellectual property developed in our related research. The government\u2019s rights in our intellectual property may lessen its commercial value, which could adversely affect our performance.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory\nAny decline in the value of carbon credits associated with our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe sale of our products is often dependent on the value of carbon credits under the RFS Program, LCFS and other similar regulatory regimes. The value of these credits fluctuates based on market forces outside of our control. There is a risk that the supply of low-carbon alternative fuels outstrips demand, resulting in the value of carbon credits declining. Any such declines could mean that the economic benefits from our efforts to de-carbonize the Luverne Facility might not be realized. Any decline in the value of carbon credits associated with our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe U.S. renewable fuels industry is highly dependent upon certain federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe EPA has implemented the RFS Program pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the \u201cEnergy Policy Act\u201d) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS Program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the U.S. The domestic market for renewable fuels is significantly impacted by federal mandates under the RFS Program for volumes of renewable fuels required to be blended with gasoline. Future demand for renewable fuels will be largely dependent upon incentives to blend renewable fuels into motor fuels, including the price of renewable fuels relative to the price of gasoline, the relative octane value of the renewable fuel, constraints in the ability of vehicles to use higher renewable fuel blends, the RFS Program and other applicable environmental requirements. Any significant increase in production capacity above the RFS Program minimum requirements may have an adverse impact on renewable fuel prices. Any change in government policies regarding the RFS Program could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\nWaivers of the RFS minimum levels of renewable fuels included in motor fuels or of the requirements by obligated parties to comply with the regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under the Energy Policy Act, the U.S. Department of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandate with respect to one or more states if the Administrator of the EPA determines that implementing the requirements would severely harm the economy or the environment of a state, a region or the nation, or that there is inadequate supply to meet the requirement. Additionally, the EPA has exercised the authority to waive the requirements of the RFS minimum levels for certain small refiners. Any waiver of the RFS minimum levels with respect to one or more states would reduce demand for renewable fuels and could cause our results of operations to decline and our financial condition to suffer. Further activity by the EPA to waive the requirements for small refiners could cause softening of pricing in the industry and cause our results of operations to similarly decline.\nA critical state program is California's LCFS program, which is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California by ensuring that the fuel sold in California meets declining targets for such emissions. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a carbon intensity (\u201cCI\u201d) score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel\u2019s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider, generally the fuel\u2019s producer or importer (the \u201cRegulated Party\u201d), is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A Regulated Party\u2019s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blend stocks and substitutes. This obligation is tracked through credits and deficits. Fuels with a CI score lower than the annual standard earn a credit, and fuels that are higher than the standard result in a deficit. Several other states also have or are considering adopting this model. Oregon\u2019s Clean Fuels Program, enacted in 2009 and implemented in 2016, operates using a credit system similar to the California LCFS program. Any changes to California\u2019s LCFS program or failure of other states to implement similar programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\nWe may face substantial delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for use of our renewable premium gasoline product, which could substantially hinder our ability to commercialize our renewable premium gasoline product in the U.S.\nCommercialization of our renewable premium gasoline product in the U.S. requires approvals from state and/or federal agencies. Before we can sell our renewable premium gasoline product as a fuel or as a gasoline blendstock, we must obtain certain approvals or certifications from the EPA. There can be no assurances that the EPA will grant such approvals or certifications. Any delay or failure in receiving approval will slow or prevent the commercialization of our renewable premium gasoline product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, California requires that fuels meet both its fuel certification requirements and a separate state low-carbon fuel standard. Any delay or failure in receiving approval for our renewable premium gasoline product will slow or prevent the commercialization of our renewable premium gasoline product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are also various third-party certification organizations, such as ASTM International and Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories, Inc., involved in standard-setting regarding the transportation, dispensing and use of liquid fuel in the U.S. and abroad. These organizations may change the current standards and additional requirements may be enacted that could prevent or delay approval of our renewable premium gasoline product. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable standards may require the expenditure of substantial resources, and there is no guarantee that we will satisfy these standards in a timely manner, if ever.\nOur isobutanol product may encounter physical or regulatory issues that could limit its usefulness as a gasoline blendstock.\nIn the gasoline blendstock market, isobutanol can be used in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates, and we believe our isobutanol is physically compatible with typical gasoline engines. However, there is a risk that under actual engine conditions, isobutanol will face significant limitations, making it unsuitable for use in high percentage gasoline blends. Additionally, current regulations limit gasoline blends to low percentages of isobutanol, and also limit combination isobutanol-ethanol blends. On June 12, 2018, the EPA announced that it approved the registration of isobutanol as a fuel additive for blending into gasoline at levels up to 16 volume percent for on-road automotive use. There can be no assurances that the EPA registration of isobutanol as a fuel additive for blending into gasoline at levels up to 16 volume percent will not be revoked or changed. Government agencies may maintain or even increase the restrictions on isobutanol gasoline blends. As we believe that the potential to use isobutanol in higher percentage blends than is feasible for ethanol will be an important factor in successfully marketing isobutanol to refiners, a low blend wall could significantly limit commercialization of isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock.\nWe may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals for use of our iDGs as animal feed, which could delay our ability to sell iDGs increasing our net cost of production and harming our operating results.\nOur production facilities and many of the ethanol plants that we might Retrofit use or will use dry-milled corn as a feedstock. We plan to sell, as animal feed, the iDGs left as a co-product of fermenting isobutanol from dry-milled corn. We believe that this will enable us to offset a significant portion of the expense of purchasing corn for fermentation. We are currently approved to sell iDGs as animal feed through the self-assessed GRAS process of the FDA via third party scientific review. In order to improve the value of our iDGs, we are working with The Association of American Feed Control Officials (\u201cAAFCO\u201d) to establish a formal definition for our iDGs as well as clearance for the materials into animal feed. We believe obtaining AAFCO approval will increase the value of our iDGs by offering customers of our iDGs further assurance of the safety of our iDGs. If we make certain changes in our biocatalyst whereby we can no longer rely on our GRAS process, we would be required to obtain FDA approval for marketing our iDGs. While we believe we can rely on the GRAS process as we update our biocatalysts to increase isobutanol production, for further customer assurance, we also intend to pursue approval upon a completed biocatalyst from the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. FDA testing and approval can take a significant amount of time, and there is no guarantee that we will ever receive such approval. While we have sold initial quantities of our iDGs from the Luverne Facility, if FDA or AAFCO approval is delayed or never obtained, or if we are unable to secure market acceptance for our iDGs, our net cost of production will increase, which may hurt our operating results.\nReductions or changes to existing regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers, all of which may significantly reduce demand for renewable fuels or our ability to supply our products.\nThe market for renewable fuels is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government laws, regulations and policies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies or how these laws, regulations and policies are implemented and enforced could cause the demand for renewable fuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of renewable fuels.\nConcerns associated with renewable fuels, including land usage, national security interests and food crop usage, continue to receive legislative, industry and public attention. This attention could result in future legislation, regulation and/or administrative action that could adversely affect our business. Any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, like the ethanol facilities that we Retrofit, our isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbon plants may emit GHG. Any changes in state or federal emissions regulations, including the passage of cap-and-trade legislation or a carbon tax, could limit our production of isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and iDGs and increase our operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of U.S. elections could lead to changes in federal or state laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemical, radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate entirely the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of, and human exposure to, these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and the failure to comply with past, present, or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business.\nOur expanded international activities may increase our exposure to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, tax and other laws and regulations.\nIn the course of our relationships with Praj and other future international partners, we may become subject to certain foreign tax, environmental and health and safety regulations that did not previously apply to us or our products. Such regulations may be unclear, not consistently applied and subject to sudden change. Implementation of compliance policies could result in additional operating costs, and our failure to comply with such laws, even inadvertently, could result in significant fines and/or penalties.\nAdditionally, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors or agents. Even with implementation of policies, training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors or agents may violate our policies. Our international partnerships may significantly increase our exposure to potential liability. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damages, civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. In the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued liability, or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock or by our announcement that such issuances and sales may occur.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions or capital raising activities, or the effect, if any, that such issuances or sales may have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the announcement that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or instruments convertible or exercisable into our common stock may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nHistorically, we have raised capital by issuing common stock and warrants in underwritten public offerings because no other reasonable sources of capital were available. These underwritten public offerings of common stock and warrants have materially and adversely affected the prevailing market prices of our common stock and caused significant dilution to our stockholders. We have also historically raised capital or refinanced outstanding debt through the issuance of convertible notes.\nWe may need to raise capital through these public offerings of common stock, warrants and convertible debt in the future.\nWe may obtain additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, subject to certain limitations in the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we issue additional shares of common stock or instruments convertible into common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, the exercise of some or all of our warrants may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, and any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our securities could suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. We cannot predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall. A variety of factors may have a significant effect on our stock price, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our liquidity, financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe position of our cash and cash equivalents;\n\u25cf the capital costs required to construct the Net-Zero 1 Project;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain certain regulatory permits or approvals for our production facilities, including the Net-Zero 1 Project;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to our business, our financial condition, our results of operation and liquidity;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations by us, our partners or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe entry into, modification or termination of licensing arrangements, marketing arrangements, and/or research, development, commercialization, supply, off-take or distribution arrangements;\n\u25cf\nour ability to consistently produce commercial quantities of isobutanol, renewable hydrocarbon products and ethanol at the Luverne Facility, the planned Expanded Facility and the ramp up production to nameplate capacity;\n\u25cf\nadditions or losses of customers or partners;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals for the use of our isobutanol and ethanol in various fuels and chemicals markets;\n\u25cf\ncommodity prices, including oil, ethanol and corn prices;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf\nissuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nlitigation involving us, our general industry or both;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements or expectations of additional financing efforts or the pursuit of strategic alternatives;\n\u25cf\nchanges in existing laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, and the adoption of or failure to adopt carbon emissions regulation;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock or equity-linked securities, such as warrants, by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions in our industry; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and cause the value of your investment to decline.\nAdditionally, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation or other derivative shareholder lawsuits. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business regardless of the outcome.\nThe price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view our warrants as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or engaging in arbitrage activity involving our common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading prices of our warrants, if any trading market becomes established, or any common stock that holders receive upon exercise of such warrants.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities linked to our common stock, such as our warrants (should an established market for such securities then exist), in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that such sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain holders of our outstanding common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares and to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investment research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations are described in this Report and other reports that we have filed with the SEC. Accordingly, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nThe estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.\nOur financial projections, including any projected investment returns on projects, sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, , industry growth, product and plant development, estimated capital expenses for growth development projects, market share projections, product pricing and sale, customer interest in our products, availability of government incentives, tax rates, accruals for estimated liabilities, , and our ability to raise sufficient funds or generate sufficient cash flow to continue operations and/or expand our production capabilities. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections, especially in light of the increased difficulty in making such estimates and assumptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our financial future profitability, cash flows and stock price.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale or issuance of equity, warrants or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. If we raise capital through debt financing, it may involve agreements that include covenants further limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships or licensing agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe may pay vendors in stock as consideration for their services, which may result in additional costs and may cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn order for us to preserve our cash resources, we may in the future pay vendors, including technology partners, in shares, warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock rather than cash. Payments for services in stock may materially and adversely affect our stockholders by diluting the value of outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, in situations where we agree to register the shares issued to a vendor, this will generally cause us to incur additional expenses associated with such registration.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.\nWe do not have any control over securities or industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our common stock price would likely decline which in turn would likely cause a decline in the value of our warrants. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our common stock price and the price of our warrants to decline or the trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms, provide that all stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting of the stockholders and not by a consent in writing, and further provide that only our board of directors may call a special meeting of the stockholders. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Finally, our charter documents establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire the Company may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nThe exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision shall not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nIf a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.", "PERMNO": 12579, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GEVO"}
