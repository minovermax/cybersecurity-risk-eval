You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes, before you decide whether to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\nThe Company has incurred losses in the past and there can be no assurance that the Company will operate profitably in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s marketing strategy emphasizes sales of subscription-based services, instead of annual licenses, and contracting with suppliers (\u201cSpokes\u201d) to connect to our clients (\u201cHubs\u201d). This strategy has resulted in the development of a foundation of hubs to which suppliers can be \u201cconnected\u201d, thereby accelerating future growth. If, however, this marketing strategy fails, revenue and operations will be negatively affected.\nThe Company had net income of $3,777,532 for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared to a net income of $666,503 for the year ended June 30, 2016. Although the Company generated net income in the year ended June 30, 2017, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve profitability in future periods. If the Company does not operate profitably in the future, the Company\u2019s current cash resources will be used to fund the Company\u2019s operating losses. Continued losses would have an adverse effect on the long-term value of the Company\u2019s common stock and any investment in the Company. The Company cannot give any assurance that the Company will continue to generate revenue or have sustainable profits.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s cash resources are currently sufficient, the Company\u2019s long-term liquidity and capital requirements may be difficult to predict, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s long-term cash position.\nHistorically, the Company has been successful in raising capital when necessary, including private placements, a registered direct offering, and stock issuances from its officers and directors, including its Chief Executive Officer and majority stockholder, in order to pay its indebtedness and fund its operations, in addition to cash flow from operations.\nIf the Company is required to seek additional financing in the future in order to fund its operations, retire its indebtedness and otherwise carry out its business plan, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement, if required or otherwise sought, would be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and in the Company\u2019s best interests.\nQuarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate, which makes it difficult to predict future performance.\nManagement expects a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue stream to come from the sale of subscriptions, and to a lesser extent, license sales, maintenance and services charged to new customers. These amounts will fluctuate because predicting future sales is difficult and involves speculation. In addition, the Company may potentially experience significant fluctuations in future operating results caused by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of its control, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe renewal rates for our service;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;\n\u25cf\nthe cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service;\n\u25cf\nthe rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;\n\u25cf\nnew product and service introductions by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nvariations in the revenue mix of editions or versions of our service;\n\u25cf\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our service;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers' purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect renewal rates;\n\u25cf\ntiming of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service;\n\u25cf\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u25cf\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing of stock awards to employees and the related financial statement impact.\nFuture operating results may fluctuate because of the foregoing factors, making it difficult to predict operating results. Period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. In addition, a relatively large portion of the Company\u2019s expenses will be fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to facilities and personnel. Therefore, future operating results will be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue because of these and other short-term fixed costs.\nThe Company will need to effectively manage its growth in order to achieve and sustain profitability. The Company\u2019s failure to manage growth effectively could reduce its sales growth and result in continued net losses.\nTo achieve continual and consistent profitable operations on a fiscal year on-going basis, the Company must have significant growth in its revenue from its products and services, specifically subscription-based services. If the Company is able to achieve significant growth in future subscription sales, and expands the scope of its operations, the Company\u2019s management, financial condition, operational capabilities, and procedures and controls could be strained. The Company cannot be certain that its existing or any additional capabilities, procedures, systems, or controls will be adequate to support the Company\u2019s operations. The Company may not be able to design, implement or improve its capabilities, procedures, systems or controls in a timely and cost-effective manner. Failure to implement, improve and expand the Company\u2019s capabilities, procedures, systems or controls in an efficient and timely manner could reduce the Company\u2019s sales growth and result in a reduction of profitability or increase of net losses.\nThe Company\u2019s officers and directors have significant control over it, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance.\nThe Company\u2019s officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields, control approximately 33% of the Company\u2019s common stock. Mr. Fields, individually, controls 26% of the Company\u2019s common stock. Consequently, Mr. Fields individually, and the Company\u2019s officers and directors, as stockholders acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as mergers or other business combination transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate charter contains authorized, unissued \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock issuable without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of \u2018blank check\u2019 preferred stock with designations, rights, and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, of which 700,000 shares are currently designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred\u201d) and 550,000 shares are designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B-1 Preferred\u201d). As of June 30, 2017, a total of 625,375 shares of Series B Preferred and 285,859 shares of Series B-1 Preferred were issued and outstanding. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, the Company\u2019s common stockholders. The issuance of an additional series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nBecause the Company has never paid dividends on its common stock, investors should exercise caution before making an investment in the Company.\nThe Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate the declaration of any dividends pertaining to its common stock in the foreseeable future. The Company intends to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors will determine future dividend policy at their sole discretion and future dividends will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, obligations of the stock issued, the Company\u2019s financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. Future dividends may also be affected by covenants contained in loan or other financing documents, which may be executed by the Company in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance that dividends will ever be paid on its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon the continued services of the Company\u2019s founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Should the Company lose the services of Mr. Fields, the Company\u2019s operations will be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon the expertise of its founder and Chief Executive Officer, Randall K. Fields. Mr. Fields is essential to the Company\u2019s operations. Accordingly, an investor must rely on Mr. Fields\u2019 management decisions that will continue to control the Company\u2019s business affairs. The Company currently maintains key man insurance on Mr. Fields\u2019 life in the amount of $5,000,000; however, that coverage would be inadequate to compensate for the loss of his services. The loss of the services of Mr. Fields would have a materially adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, the Company may be unable to develop, retain or expand the staff necessary to support its operational business needs.\nThe Company\u2019s current and future success depends on its ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate various employees, including skilled software development, technical, managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such employees is intense and the Company may be unable to attract or retain such professionals. If the Company fails to attract and retain these professionals, the Company\u2019s revenue and expansion plans may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s officers and directors have limited liability and indemnification rights under the Company\u2019s organizational documents, which may impact its results.\nThe Company\u2019s officers and directors are required to exercise good faith and high integrity in the management of the Company\u2019s affairs. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, however, provide, that the officers and directors shall have no liability to the stockholders for losses sustained or liabilities incurred which arise from any transaction in their respective managerial capacities unless they violated their duty of loyalty, did not act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated the law, approved an improper dividend or stock repurchase or derived an improper benefit from the transaction. As a result, an investor may have a more limited right to action than he would have had if such a provision were not present. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws also require it to indemnify the Company\u2019s officers and directors against any losses or liabilities they may incur as a result of the manner in which they operate the Company\u2019s business or conduct the Company\u2019s internal affairs, provided that the officers and directors reasonably believe such actions to be in, or not opposed to, the Company\u2019s best interests, and their conduct does not constitute gross negligence, misconduct or breach of fiduciary obligations.\nRisks Related to the ReposiTrak\nThe Company faces risks associated with new product introductions.\nIt may be difficult for the company to assess risks associated with potential new product offerings:\n\u25cf\nIt may be difficult for the Company to predict the amount of service and technological resources that will be needed by customers of new offerings, and if the Company underestimates the necessary resources, the quality of its service will be negatively impacted thereby undermining the value of the product to the customer;\n\u25cf\ntechnological issues between the Company and customers may be experienced in capturing data necessary for new product offerings, and these technological issues may result in unforeseen conflicts or technological setbacks when implementing these products which could result in material delays and even result in a termination of the engagement;\n\u25cf\na customer\u2019s experience with new offerings, if negative, may prevent the Company from having an opportunity to sell additional products and services to that customer;\n\u25cf\nif customers do not use the Company\u2019s products as recommends and/or fails to implement any needed corrective action(s), it is unlikely that customers will experience the business benefits from these products and may therefore be hesitant to continue the engagement as well as acquire any other products from the Company; and\n\u25cf\ndelays in proceeding with the implementation of new products for a new customer will negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and its ability to predict cash flow.\nIf our products do not perform as expected, whether as a result of operator error or otherwise, it would impair our operating results and reputation.\nOur success depends on the food safety market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality reporting for our customers. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and operator errors, including if our systems fail to accurately report issues that could reduce the liability of our clients in the event of a product recall. In addition, our reputation and the reputation of our products can be adversely affected if our systems fail to perform as expected.\nHowever, if our customers or potential customers fail to implement and use our systems as suggested by us, they may not be in a position to deal with a recall as effectively as they could have. As a result, the failure or perceived failure of our products to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nIf a customer is sued because of a recalled product we could be joined in that suit, the defense of which would impair our operating results.\nWe believe our products would be helpful in the event of a recall. However, their ultimate efficacy is dependent on how the customer uses our products which is in many ways out of our control. Similarly, a customer which is a defendant in a product liability case could claim that had our services performed as represented the extent of potential liability would have been minimized and therefore the Company should have some contributory liability in the case. Defending such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nThe deployment of the Company\u2019s services, or consultation provided by Company personnel, could result in litigation naming the Company as a party, which litigation could result in a material and adverse effect on the Company, and its results from operations.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s services are marketed to potential customers based, in part, on our service\u2019s ability to reduce a company\u2019s potential regulatory, legal, and criminal risk from its supply chain partners. In the event litigation is commenced against a customer based on issues caused by a constituent in the supply chain, or consultation provided by Company personnel, the Company could be joined or named in such litigation. As a result, the Company could face substantial defense costs. In addition, any adverse determination resulting in such litigation could have a material and adverse effect on the Company, and its results from operations.\nBusiness Operations Risks\nIf the Company\u2019s marketing strategy fails, its revenue and operations will be negatively affected.\nThe Company plans to concentrate its future sales efforts towards marketing the Company\u2019s applications and services, and specifically to contract with suppliers, our Spokes, to connect to our existing Hubs previously signed up by the Company. These applications and services are designed to be highly flexible so that they can work in multiple retail and supplier environments such as grocery stores, convenience stores, specialty retail and route-based delivery environments. There is no assurance that the public will accept the Company\u2019s applications and services in proportion to the Company\u2019s increased marketing of this product line, or that the Company will be able to successfully leverage its hubs to increase revenue by connecting suppliers. The Company may face significant competition that may negatively affect demand for its applications and services, including the public\u2019s preference for the Company\u2019s competitors\u2019 new product releases or updates over the Company\u2019s releases or updates. If the Company\u2019s applications and services marketing strategies fail, the Company will need to refocus its marketing strategy toward other product offerings, which could lead to increased development and marketing costs, delayed revenue streams, and otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company faces threats from competing and emerging technologies that may affect its profitability.\nMarkets for the Company\u2019s type of software products and that of its competitors are characterized by:\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of new software, software solutions or enhancements that are subject to constant change;\n\u25cf\nrapidly evolving technological change; and\n\u25cf\nunanticipated changes in customer needs.\nBecause these markets are subject to such rapid change, the life cycle of the Company\u2019s products is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company is subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nwhether or how the Company will respond to technological changes in a timely or cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf\nwhether the products or technologies developed by the Company\u2019s competitors will render the Company\u2019s products and services obsolete or shorten the life cycle of the Company\u2019s products and services; and\n\u25cf\nwhether the Company\u2019s products and services will achieve market acceptance.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our customers from a third-party data center hosting facility located in the United States. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. As we continue to add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.\nAs part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers' data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility physically located in a different geographic region of the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through an alternate facility. We do not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nWe cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers' ability to continue their operations and spending levels, and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the level of service at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer.\nWeakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf the Company is unable to adapt to constantly changing markets and to continue to develop new products and technologies to meet the customers\u2019 needs, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability will be negatively affected.\nThe Company\u2019s future revenue is dependent upon the successful and timely development and licensing of new and enhanced versions of its products and potential product offerings suitable to the customer\u2019s needs. If the Company fails to successfully upgrade existing products and develop new products, and those new products do not achieve market acceptance, the Company\u2019s revenue will be negatively impacted.\nThe Company faces risks associated with proprietary protection of the Company\u2019s software.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the Company\u2019s ability to develop and protect existing and new proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. The Company seeks to protect its software, documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of patents, trademarks, and copyright laws, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. While the Company has attempted to safeguard and maintain the Company\u2019s proprietary rights, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in doing so. The Company\u2019s competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company\u2019s.\nDespite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Company\u2019s products or obtain and use information that the Company regards as proprietary. In some types of situations, the Company may rely in part on \u2018shrink wrap\u2019 or \u2018point and click\u2019 licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Policing unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s products is difficult. While the Company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of the Company\u2019s software exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as the United States. The Company can offer no assurance that the Company\u2019s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the Company\u2019s competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology.\nThe Company may discover software errors in its products that may result in a loss of revenue, injury to the Company\u2019s reputation or subject us to substantial liability.\nNon-conformities or bugs (\u201cerrors\u201d) may be found from time to time in the Company\u2019s existing, new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of revenue or injury to the Company\u2019s reputation. In the past, the Company has discovered errors in its products and as a result, has experienced delays in the shipment of products. Errors in the Company\u2019s products may be caused by defects in third-party software incorporated into the Company\u2019s products. If so, the Company may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers. Since these defects may not be as significant to the software provider as they are to us, the Company may not receive the rapid cooperation that may be required. The Company may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third-party software, and even if the Company does have access to the code, the Company may not be able to fix the defect. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since the Company\u2019s customers use the Company\u2019s products for critical business applications, any errors, defects or other performance problems could hurt the Company\u2019s reputation and may result in damage to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. These potential scenarios, successful or otherwise, would likely be time consuming and costly.\nSome competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources that may give them an advantage in the market.\nMany of the Company\u2019s competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers in the industry, which could result in a loss of potential or current customers or could force us to lower prices. Any of these actions could have a significant effect on revenue. In addition, the competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources to the development of new technologies that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render the Company\u2019s product and service offerings less desirable to customers, again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price the Company can demand for the Company\u2019s offerings.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe limited public market for the Company\u2019s securities may adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to liquidate an investment in the Company.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is currently quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is limited trading activity. The Company can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate the Company\u2019s shares should there be a need or desire to do so.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s shares may lead to future dilution in the value of the Company\u2019s common stock, will lead to a reduction in shareholder voting power and may prevent a change in Company control.\nThe shares may be substantially diluted due to the following:\n\u25cf\nissuance of common stock in connection with funding agreements with third parties and future issuances of common and preferred stock by the Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf\nthe Board of Directors has the power to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock and the right to determine the voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation, preferences and other conditions of the shares without shareholder approval.\nStock issuances may result in reduction of the book value or market price of outstanding shares of common stock. If the Company issues any additional shares of common or preferred stock, proportionate ownership of common stock and voting power will be reduced. Further, any new issuance of common or preferred stock may prevent a change in control or management.", "PERMNO": 12380, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "PCYG"}
