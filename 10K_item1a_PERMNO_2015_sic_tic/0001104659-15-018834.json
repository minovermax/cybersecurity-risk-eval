RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. The risks and uncertainties we have described below include all of the material risks known to us, however, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations.\nOur investors may lose their entire investment in our securities\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and the price of our securities has been and will likely continue to be volatile. Only investors who are experienced in high risk investments and who can afford to lose their entire investment should consider an investment in our securities.\nOur profitability depends largely on the success of the Mt. Hope Project, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nWe are focused primarily on the development of the Mt. Hope Project. Accordingly, our profitability depends largely upon the successful financing to continue the development and operation of this project. We are currently incurring losses and we expect to continue to incur losses until sometime after molybdenum production begins at the Mt. Hope Project. The LLC may never achieve production at the Mt. Hope Project and may never be profitable even if production is achieved. The failure to successfully finance the continuing development at the Mt. Hope Project would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if the LLC is successful in achieving production, an interruption in operations at the Mt. Hope Project that prevents the LLC from extracting ore from the Mt. Hope Project for any reason would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn March 2013, China Development Bank suspended work on the Term Loan and we have not obtained, and may not obtain, alternative financing, which could cause additional delays or expenses in developing the Mt. Hope Project.\nThe Company was notified on March 20, 2013 that China Development Bank had provided instructions to its legal counsel to suspend work on the Term Loan. The Company is continuing to work to secure another strategic partner in or outside of China to help advance the full financing of the Mt. Hope Project. The Company has also begun to pursue other potential financing sources such as capital markets, domestic and international credit markets, and bank project financing. There is no assurance that a suitable partner will be identified or that alternative financing can be achieved on economically suitable terms, or at all.\nWe may require and may not be able to obtain substantial additional financing in order to fund the operations of the Company and the LLC and if we are successful in raising additional capital, it may have dilutive and other adverse effects on our stockholders\nIf the actual costs to obtain financing and complete the development of the Mt. Hope Project are significantly higher than we expect, we may not have enough funds to cover these costs and we may not be able to obtain other sources of financing. The failure to obtain all necessary financing would prevent the LLC from achieving production at the Mt. Hope Project and impede our ability to become profitable. Our financing plan assumes that POS-Minerals will continue to make their required on-going capital contributions after we obtain financing or exhaust the reserve account as outlined in the LLC Agreement. We may not be able to obtain additional financing necessary for achieving production at the Mt. Hope Project if these contributions are not made.\nWe continue to review the technical merits of the Liberty Project, which would also require significant additional capital to permit and/or commence mining activities. We may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to develop the Liberty Project should we decide to do so.\nIf additional financing is not available, or available only on terms that are not acceptable to us, we may be unable to fund the development and expansion of our business, attract and retain qualified personnel, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Any of these events may harm our business. Also, if we raise funds by issuing additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities convertible into preferred or common stock, or a sale of additional minority interests in our assets, our existing stockholders will experience dilution, which may be significant, to their ownership interest in us or our assets. If we raise funds by issuing shares of a different class of stock other than our common stock or by issuing debt, the holders of such different classes of stock or debt securities may have rights senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nThe LLC Agreement gives POS-Minerals the right to approve certain major decisions regarding the Mt. Hope Project which could impair our ability to quickly adapt to changing market conditions\nThe LLC Agreement requires unanimous approval of the members for certain major decisions regarding the Mt. Hope Project. This effectively provides either member with a veto right over the specified decisions. These decisions include:\n\u00b7 Approval of the operations to be conducted and objectives to be accomplished by the Mt. Hope Project (\u201cProgram and Budget\u201d);\n\u00b7 Approval of the budget for costs to be incurred by the LLC and the schedule of cash capital contributions to be made to the LLC (\u201cBudget\u201d);\n\u00b7 Approval of cost overruns in excess of 10% until we obtain financing or exhaust the reserve account balance, and thereafter 15% of the approved Program and Budget;\n\u00b7 Approval of an expansion or contraction of the average tons per day (\u201ctpd\u201d) planned of 20% or more from the relevant tpd throughput schedule in the BFS;\n\u00b7 Approval of the LLC\u2019s acquisition or disposition of significant real property, water rights or real estate assets;\n\u00b7 Approval of the incurrence of indebtedness by the LLC that requires (1) an asset of the LLC to be pledged as security, (2) the pledge of a membership interest in the LLC, or (3) a guaranty by either the Company or POS-Minerals, other than in each instance a purchase money security interest or other security interest in the LLC to finance the acquisition or lease of equipment; and\n\u00b7 Approval of the issuance by the LLC of an ownership interest to any person other than Nevada Moly or POS-Minerals.\nThe requirement that certain decisions be approved by POS-Minerals may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from certain decisions or transactions that we would otherwise cause the LLC to make if they are opposed by POS-Minerals.\nFluctuations in the market price of molybdenum could adversely affect the value of our company and our securities\nThe profitability of our mining operations will be influenced by the market price of the metals we mine. The market prices of metals such as molybdenum fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors including several that are beyond the control of any mining company. These factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation, the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, global or regional political and economic conditions and banking crises, global and regional demand, production costs in major molybdenum producing areas, and a number of other factors. Sustained periods of low molybdenum prices would adversely impact our revenues, profits, and cash flows. In particular, a sustained low molybdenum price could:\n\u00b7 Have a continued negative impact on the availability of financing to us;\n\u00b7 Cause a continued delay and suspension of our development activities and, ultimately, mining operations at our Mt. Hope Project, if such operations become uneconomic at the then-prevailing molybdenum price; and\n\u00b7 Prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our agreements or licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in, or be forced to sell, our properties.\nFurthermore, the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects if molybdenum prices were to significantly decline could cause substantial delays. Mineral reserve calculations and life-of-mine plans using lower molybdenum prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges.\nThe volatility in metals prices is illustrated by the quarterly average price range from January 2002 through February 2014 for molybdenum: $2.73 - $35.37 per pound. Average molybdenum prices are quoted in Platt\u2019s Metals Week. After a period of high, sustained molybdenum prices in 2004 through September 2008, where the price of molybdenum averaged $27.34 per pound, the price of molybdenum fell to approximately $7.70 per pound in April 2009. Prices experienced notable volatility during 2014 and finished the year at $9.50 per pound. Although we estimate the Mt. Hope Project\u2019s average cost of production over the first five years to be approximately $7.00 per pound, a sustained period of lower molybdenum prices would have material negative impacts on the Company\u2019s profitability. Actual molybdenum prices when and if we commence commercial production cannot be estimated and are subject to numerous factors outside our control.\nOur profitability is subject to demand for molybdenum, and any decrease in that demand, or increase in the world\u2019s supply, could adversely affect our results of operations\nMolybdenum is used primarily in the steel industry. The demand for molybdenum from the steel industry and other industries was extremely robust through the third quarter of 2008, primarily fueled by growth in Asia and other developing countries. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the global financial crisis forced steel companies to substantially reduce their production levels with a corresponding reduction in the consumption of molybdenum, which contributed to the decline in the price of molybdenum. Sustained low molybdenum demand resulting from a prolonged global financial crisis may cause prolonged periods of low molybdenum prices ultimately resulting in a continued delay in our ability to obtain financing, and a continued suspension of our development or, in the future, a suspension of our mining operations at our Mt. Hope Project.\nA sustained significant increase in molybdenum supply could also adversely affect our results. The CPM Group estimate that during the next five years a total of 69.6 million annual pounds of production could be added to the supply of molybdenum (including a portion of the supply from our Mt. Hope Project). In the event demand for molybdenum does not increase to consume the potential additional production, the price for molybdenum may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to counter party risk, which may adversely affect our results of operations\nThe off-take agreements the Company has completed including contracts with APERAM, SeAH Besteel, and Sojitz contain provisions allowing for the sale of molybdenum at certain floor prices, or higher, over the life of the agreements. During the past 18 months there have been periods where the spot molybdenum prices fell below the inflation-adjusted floor prices in the contracts. During these time periods all three contracts would have provided for the Company to sell molybdenum at above-spot prices. In the event that our contract parties choose not to honor their contractual obligations, attempt to terminate these agreements as a result of the continuing delay in achieving production, or discontinue operations, our profitability may be adversely impacted. We may be unable to sell any product our contract parties fail to purchase in a timely manner, at comparable prices, or at all.\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain or renew licenses, rights and permits required to develop or operate our mines, or we may encounter environmental conditions or requirements that would adversely affect our business\nIn the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. The LLC was required to obtain a ROD from the BLM, authorizing implementation of the Mt. Hope Project PoO. The LLC was also required to obtain various state and federal permits including water protection, air quality, water rights and reclamation permits. The BLM\u2019s issuance of the ROD is the subject of an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Nevada State Engineer\u2019s issuance of the water permits and 3M plans are on appeal to the Nevada State Supreme Court. We may not be successful in defending legal challenges to our permits, which may affect our ability to maintain the permits. In addition to requiring permits for the development of the Mt. Hope Project, we will need to obtain and modify various mining and environmental permits during the life of the project. Obtaining, modifying, and renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often requiring public hearings and substantial expenditures. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain, modify or renew permits will be contingent upon many variables, some of which are not within our control. Increased costs or delays could occur, depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority. All necessary permits may not be obtained and, if obtained, may not be maintained or renewed, or the costs involved in each case may exceed those that we previously estimated. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the financing, development or operation of the Mt. Hope Project.\nThe development of the Mt. Hope Project may be delayed, which could result in increased costs or an inability to complete its development\nThe LLC may experience continued delays in developing the Mt. Hope Project. These could increase its development costs, affect its economic viability, or prevent us from completing its development. The timing of development of the Mt. Hope Project depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our and the LLC\u2019s control, including:\n\u00b7 Timely availability of project financing to construct the Mt. Hope Project;\n\u00b7 Timely availability of equipment;\n\u00b7 Continued appeal or unfavorable order concerning the water rights ruling, 3M plan, or permits, including the ROD;\n\u00b7 Sustained low prices for molybdenum;\n\u00b7 Completion of advanced engineering; and\n\u00b7 Timely availability of labor and resources from construction contractors throughout construction of the project.\nIn addition, factors such as sustained low prices of molybdenum and volatility in foreign exchange or interest rates could adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the development of the project on a timely basis. Any delays caused by our inability to raise capital when needed may lead to the cancellation or extension of, or defaults under, agreements with equipment manufacturers or a need to sell equipment already purchased, any of which may adversely impact the Mt. Hope Project timeline. Additionally, delays to the Mt. Hope Project schedule have consequences with regard to our LLC Agreement with POS-Minerals, including potential claims by POS-Minerals, which may serve to increase our capital obligations and further enhance this risk factor.\nOur mineralization and reserve estimates are uncertain, and any material inaccuracies in those estimates could adversely affect the value of our mineral reserves\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineralization and reserves, including many factors beyond our control. The estimation of mineralization and reserves is a subjective process and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, metallurgical testing, production, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate may justify revision of such estimates. The volume and grade of mineralization and reserves recovered and rates of production may be less than anticipated. Assumptions about prices are subject to greater uncertainty and metals prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Further declines in the market price of molybdenum and copper may render mineralization and reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, which may materially and adversely impact our reserve and mineralization estimates at our projects. Changes in operating and capital\ncosts and other factors including, but not limited to, short-term operating factors such as the need for sequential development of ore bodies and the processing of new or different ore grades, may also materially and adversely affect mineralization and reserves.\nAny material inaccuracies in our production estimates could adversely affect our results of operations\nWe have prepared estimates of future molybdenum production. We or the LLC may never achieve these production estimates or any production at all. Our production estimates depend on, among other things:\n\u00b7 The accuracy of our mineralization and reserves estimates;\n\u00b7 The accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and recovery rates;\n\u00b7 Ground conditions and physical characteristics of the mineralization, such as hardness and the presence or absence of particular metallurgical characteristics; and,\n\u00b7 The accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining and processing.\nOur actual production may vary from our estimates if any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect. With respect to the Mt. Hope Project, we do not have the benefit of actual mining and production experience in verifying our estimates, which increases the likelihood that actual production results will vary from the estimates.\nMining has inherent dangers and is subject to conditions or events beyond our control, and any operating hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business\nMining at the Mt. Hope Project will involve the potential for various types of risks and hazards, including: environmental hazards, industrial accidents, metallurgical and other processing problems, unusual or unexpected rock formations, structure cave-in or slides, flooding, fires, and interruption due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.\nThese risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities or other properties, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs, monetary losses, and possible legal liability. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums and some types of insurance may be unavailable or too expensive to maintain. We may suffer a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our securities may decline if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by our insurance policies.\nOur operations make us susceptible to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us\nMining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with the potential pollution of the environment and the necessary disposal of mining waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Insurance against environmental risk (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to us or the LLC (or to other companies in the minerals industry) at a reasonable price. To the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities, the satisfaction of any such liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. Laws and regulations intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive.\nLegal title to the properties in which we have an interest may be challenged, which could result in the loss of our rights in those properties\nThe ownership and validity, or title, of unpatented mining claims are often uncertain and may be contested. A successful claim contesting our title or interest to a property or, in the case of the Mt. Hope Project, the landowner\u2019s title or interest to such property could cause us and/or the LLC to lose the rights to mine that property. In addition, the success of such a claimant could result in our not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact General Moly\u2019s planned future operations\nEnergy is anticipated to be a significant input in General Moly\u2019s operations. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the possible impacts of climate change. U.S. Congress and several states have initiated legislation regarding climate change that could affect energy prices and demand. In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the federal Clean Air Act indicating that current and projected\nconcentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, threaten the public health and welfare. It is possible that regulation may be promulgated in the U.S. to address the concerns raised by the endangerment finding.\nLegislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compare.\nThe possible physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s planned future operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in the area in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall, storm patterns and intensities, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of the Company\u2019s planned future operations.\nMineral exploration and mining activities require compliance with a broad range of laws and regulations, and compliance with or violation of these laws and regulations may be costly\nMining operations and exploration activities are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, reclamation obligations, and mine safety. In order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be required to make capital and operating expenditures or to close an operation until a particular problem is remedied. In addition, if our activities violate any such laws and regulations, we may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage, and may be fined if convicted of an offense under such legislation. We may also incur additional expenses and our projects may be delayed as a result of changes and amendments to such laws and regulations, including changes in local, state, and federal taxation.\nLand reclamation requirements for exploration properties may be burdensome, may divert funds from our exploration programs and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition\nAlthough variable, depending on location and the governing authority, land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies, as well as companies with mining operations, in order to minimize long term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents and to reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance landforms and vegetation. In order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our mineral exploration, we and the LLC must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration programs. Such costs could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nNon-compliance with our Mt. Hope Mines Inc. Lease could result in loss of the LLC\u2019s rights to develop the Mt. Hope Project and may adversely affect our business\nThe LLC leases the Mt. Hope Project from MHMI under the Mt. Hope Lease. Failure to comply with the terms of the Mt. Hope Lease (which principally require us to make prescribed payments on or before certain prescribed dates) could result in loss of the LLC\u2019s rights to develop the Mt. Hope Project. Any loss of rights under the Mt. Hope Lease would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to generate revenues.\nOur ability to operate our Company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we are not able to attract and retain the additional personnel we will need to develop any of our projects, including the Mt. Hope Project\nWe are a small company with a limited operating history and relatively few employees. The development of any of our proposed projects, including the Mt. Hope Project, will place substantial demands on us. We depend on the services of key executives and a small number of personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Counsel and Vice President of Human Resources, Mt. Hope Vice President and General Manager, Controller and Treasurer, and Vice President of Environmental and Permitting. We will be required to recruit additional personnel and to train, motivate and manage these new employees. The number of persons skilled in the development and operation of mining properties is limited and significant competition exists for these individuals. We implemented a reduction in force in November 2014, affecting 40% of our employees and contractors as a result of the delay in our ability to obtain project financing. In January 2015, we implemented a new retention program including cash stay incentives to our non-officer employees and equity incentives to our officers, though this new retention program may not be successful in retaining our executives and key employees. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance to cover our executive officers. Due to the relatively small size of our company and the specific skill sets of our key employees, the loss of any of our key employees or our failure to attract and\nretain key personnel may delay or otherwise adversely affect the development of the Mt. Hope Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on independent contractors and experts and technical and operational service providers over whom we may have limited control\nBecause we are a small development stage company, we rely on independent contractors to assist us with technical assistance and services, contracting and procurement and other matters, including the services of geologists, attorneys, engineers and others. Our limited control over the activities and business practices of these service providers or any inability on our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges to the General Mining Law of 1872 and related federal legislation that impact unpatented mining claims could adversely impact the Mt. Hope Project\nThe Mt. Hope Project is located substantially on unpatented mining claims administered by the BLM. Mining on unpatented mining claims is conducted pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872 and amendments thereto. Legislation for the amendment of the mining laws applicable to mining property has been considered by the U.S. Congress, which may include imposition of a governmental royalty and new permitting and environmental rules. Amendments to the mining laws could cause delays, increase the costs, and have an adverse effect on the returns anticipated from the Mt. Hope Project.\nIncreased costs could affect our ability to become profitable\nCosts at any particular mining location frequently are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing metallurgy, and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel, electricity, and labor. Commodity costs are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at our projects less profitable or uneconomic.\nWe anticipate significant capital expenditures in connection with the development of the Mt. Hope Project. In the past several years, costs associated with capital expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis as a result of major factors beyond our control. Increased costs for capital expenditures have an adverse effect on the returns anticipated from the Mt. Hope Project.\nShortages of critical parts, equipment and skilled labor may adversely affect our development projects\nThe industry has been impacted at times by increased worldwide demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, tires, and skilled labor. Shortages may cause unanticipated cost increases and delays in delivery times, potentially impacting operating costs, capital expenditures, and production schedules.\nCost estimates and timing of new projects are uncertain\nThe capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project economics. There are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules, including, among others:\n\u00b7 Availability of project financing;\n\u00b7 Availability of water, labor, power, transportation, commodities, and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 Increases in input commodity prices and labor costs;\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u00b7 Difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of years; and\n\u00b7 Delays in obtaining and maintaining environmental or other government permits, including appeals of granted water applications and the ROD.\nLegislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may make it difficult for us to retain or attract officers and directors and increase the costs of doing business, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of the recent changes and currently proposed changes in the rules and regulations, which govern publicly-held companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, adopted in July 2010, imposes significant additional obligations and disclosure requirements, as to which SEC rulemaking is ongoing. We are a small company with a limited operating history and no revenues or profits, which may influence the decisions of potential candidates we may recruit as directors or officers. The real and perceived increased personal risk associated with these requirements may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles. In addition, costs of compliance with such legislation, including several provisions specifically applicable to companies engaged in mining operations, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that would benefit stockholders\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the company. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7 Provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into three groups;\n\u00b7 Authorize our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock;\n\u00b7 Restrict our ability to engage in transactions with stockholders with 15% or more of outstanding voting stock;\n\u00b7 Authorize the calling of special meetings of stockholders only by the board of directors, not by the stockholders;\n\u00b7 Limit the business transacted at any meeting of stockholders to those purposes specifically stated in the notice of the meeting; and\n\u00b7 Prohibit stockholder action by written consent without a meeting and provide that directors may be removed only at a meeting of stockholders.\nBecause of these provisions, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this document may constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of our Company, the Mt. Hope Project and our other projects, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We use the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the following:\n\u00b7 Our ability to obtain project financing for the development and construction of the Mt. Hope Project;\n\u00b7 Our dependence on the success of the Mt. Hope Project;\n\u00b7 The ability to obtain and maintain all required permits, water rights, and approvals for the Mt. Hope Project and the Liberty Project;\n\u00b7 Issues related to the management of the Mt. Hope Project pursuant to the LLC Agreement;\n\u00b7 Risks related to the failure of POS-Minerals to make ongoing cash contributions pursuant to the LLC Agreement;\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in the market price of, and demand for, molybdenum and other metals;\n\u00b7 The estimation and realization of mineral reserves and production estimates, if any;\n\u00b7 The timing of exploration, development and production activities and estimated future production, if any;\n\u00b7 Estimates related to costs of production, capital, operating and exploration expenditures;\n\u00b7 Requirements for additional capital and our ability to obtain additional capital in a timely manner and on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 Our ability to renegotiate, restructure, suspend, cancel or extend payment terms of contracts as necessary or appropriate in order to conserve cash;\n\u00b7 Government regulation of mining operations, environmental conditions and risks, reclamation and rehabilitation expenses;\n\u00b7 Title disputes or claims;\n\u00b7 Limitations of insurance coverage; and\n\u00b7 The future price of molybdenum, copper or other metals.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and any events anticipated in the forward-looking statements may not actually occur.", "PERMNO": 91418, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "GMO"}
