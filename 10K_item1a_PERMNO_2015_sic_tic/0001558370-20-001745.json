{"cik": "19411", "company": "MAGELLAN HEALTH INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nReliance on Customer Contracts-The Company\u2019s inability to renew, extend or replace expiring or terminated contracts could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s net revenue is derived from contracts that may be terminated immediately with cause and many, including some of the Company\u2019s most significant contracts, are terminable without cause by the customer upon notice and the passage of a specified period of time (typically between 60 and 180 days), or upon the occurrence of certain other specified events. The Company\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 40.3 percent, 51.7 percent and 56.6 percent of the Company\u2019s net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Loss of all of these contracts or customers would, and loss of any one of these contracts or customers could, materially reduce the Company\u2019s net revenue and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, profitability and financial condition. See Note 2-\u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies-Significant Customers\u201d to the consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere herein for a discussion of the Company\u2019s significant customers.\nIntegration of Companies Acquired by Magellan-The Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected if the integration of companies acquired by Magellan is not completed in a timely and effective manner.\nHistorically the Company\u2019s has grown via strategic acquisitions, and may continue to do so in the future. After Magellan closes on an acquisition, it must integrate the acquired company into Magellan\u2019s policies, procedures and systems. Failure to effectively integrate an acquired business or the failure of the acquired business to perform as anticipated could result in excessive costs being incurred, a delay in obtaining targeted synergies, decreased customer\nperformance (which could result in contract penalties and/or terminations), increased employee turnover, and lost sales opportunities. Finally, difficulties assimilating acquired operations and services could result in the diversion of capital and management\u2019s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.\nChanges in the Medical Managed Care Carve-Out Industry-Certain changes in the business practices of this industry could negatively impact the Company\u2019s resources, profitability and results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments\u2019 net revenues are derived from customers in the medical managed healthcare industry, including managed care companies, health insurers and other health plans. Some types of changes in this industry\u2019s business practices could negatively impact the Company. For example, if the Company\u2019s managed care customers seek to provide services directly to their subscribers, instead of contracting with the Company for such services, the Company could be adversely affected. In this regard, certain of the Company\u2019s major customers in the past have not renewed all or part of their contracts with the Company, and instead provided managed healthcare services directly to their subscribers. In addition, the Company has a significant number of contracts with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and other regional health plans. Consolidation of the healthcare industry through acquisitions and mergers could potentially result in the loss of contracts for the Company. In addition, in some instances state Medicaid agencies may look to procure certain services, such as pharmacy benefit management services, directly instead of contracting with a managed care company to do so, potentially reducing the amount of business opportunities from managed care customers. Any of these changes could reduce the Company\u2019s net revenue, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in the Contracting Model for Medicaid Contracts-Certain changes in the contracting model used by states for managed healthcare services contracts relating to Medicaid lives could negatively impact the Company\u2019s resources, profitability and results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s Healthcare segment net revenue is derived from direct contracts that it has with state or county governments for the provision of services to Medicaid enrollees. Certain states have recently contracted with managed care companies to manage both the behavioral and physical medical care of their Medicaid enrollees. If other governmental entities change the method for contracting for Medicaid business to a fully integrated model, the Company will attempt to subcontract with the managed care organizations to provide behavioral healthcare management for such Medicaid business; however, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to secure such arrangements. Alternatively, the Company may choose to pursue licensure as a health plan to bid on this integrated business. Accordingly, if such a change in the contracting model were to occur, it is possible that the Company could lose current contracted revenues, as well as be unable to bid on potential new business opportunities, thus negatively impacting the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nRisk-Based Products-Because the Company provides services at a fixed fee, if the Company is unable to maintain historical margins, or is unable to accurately predict and control healthcare costs, the Company\u2019s profitability could decline.\nThe Company derives its net revenue primarily from arrangements under which the Company assumes responsibility for costs of treatment in exchange for a fixed fee. The Company refers to such arrangements as \u201crisk-based contracts\u201d or \u201crisk-based products,\u201d which include EAP services. These arrangements provided 49.6 percent, 59.3 percent and 63.4 percent of the Company\u2019s net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nThe profitability of the Company\u2019s risk contracts could be reduced if the Company is unable to maintain its historical margins. The competitive environment for the Company\u2019s risk products could result in pricing pressures which cause the Company to reduce its rates. In addition, customer demands or expectations as to margin levels, inclusive of MCC customers\u2019 budgeting issues, could cause the Company to reduce its rates. A reduction in risk rates which are not accompanied by a reduction in services covered or expected underlying care trend could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s operating margins.\nProfitability of the Company\u2019s risk contracts could also be reduced if the Company is unable to accurately estimate the rate of service utilization by members or the cost of such services when the Company prices its services. The Company\u2019s assumptions of utilization and costs when the Company prices its services may not ultimately reflect actual utilization rates and costs, many aspects of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the cost of services\nprovided to members under a contract together with the administrative costs exceeds the aggregate fees received by the Company under such contract, the Company will incur a loss on the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability could also be reduced if the Company is required to make adjustments to estimates made in reporting historical financial results regarding cost of care, reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements as medical claims payable. Medical claims payable includes reserves for incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims, which are claims for covered services rendered by the Company\u2019s providers which have not yet been submitted to the Company for payment. The Company estimates and reserves for IBNR claims based on past claims payment experience, including the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date the claims are received and between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, enrollment data, utilization statistics, adjudication decisions, authorized healthcare services and other factors. This data is incorporated into contract-specific reserve models. The estimates for submitted claims and IBNR claims are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required.\nIf such risk-based products are not correctly underwritten, the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected. Factors that affect the Company\u2019s ability to price the Company\u2019s services, or accurately make estimates of IBNR claims and other expenses for which the Company creates reserves may include differences between the Company\u2019s assumptions and actual results arising from, among other things:\n\u25cf changes in the delivery system;\n\u25cf changes in utilization patterns;\n\u25cf changes in the number of members seeking treatment;\n\u25cf unforeseen fluctuations in claims backlogs;\n\u25cf unforeseen increases in the costs of the services;\n\u25cf the occurrence of catastrophes;\n\u25cf regulatory changes; and\n\u25cf changes in benefit plan design.\nSome of these factors could impact the ability of the Company to manage and control the medical costs to the extent assumed in the pricing of its services.\nIf the Company\u2019s membership in risk-based business continues to grow (which is a major focus of the Company\u2019s strategy), the Company\u2019s exposure to potential losses from risk-based products will also increase.\nExpansion of Risk-Based Products-Because the Company intends to continue its expansion into clinically integrated management of special populations eligible for Medicaid and Medicare including individuals with SMI, and other unique high-cost populations, if the Company is unable to accurately underwrite the healthcare cost risk for this new business and control associated costs, the Company\u2019s profitability could decline.\nThe Company believes that it can leverage its information systems, call center, claims and network infrastructure as well as its financial strength and underwriting expertise to facilitate the development of risk product offerings to states that include behavioral healthcare and physical medical care for their special Medicaid and dual eligible populations, particularly individuals with serious mental illness (\u201cSMI\u201d). As the Company expands into new markets, the Company will incur start-up costs to develop and grow this business. The Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted until such time that sufficient business is generated to offset these start-up costs.\nFurthermore, as the Company expands into new markets, there is an increased risk associated with the underwriting and implementation for this business. Profitability of any such business could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to accurately estimate the rate of service utilization or the cost of such services when the Company prices its services. The Company\u2019s assumptions of utilization and costs when the Company prices its services may not\nultimately reflect actual utilization rates and costs, many aspects of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the cost of services provided to members under a contract together with the administrative costs exceeds the aggregate fees received by the Company under such contract, the Company will incur a loss on the contract.\nThe Company may partner with managed care organizations to create joint ventures in some states. Conflicts or disagreements between the Company and any joint venture partner may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture or may ultimately threaten the ability of any such joint venture to continue. The Company is also subject to additional risks and uncertainties because the Company may be dependent upon, and subject to, liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not entirely under the Company\u2019s control.\nProvider Agreements-Failure to maintain or to secure cost-effective healthcare provider contracts may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends, to an extent, upon the ability to contract favorably with certain healthcare providers. The Company may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms. If the Company is unable to retain its current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms, the Company\u2019s profitability could be reduced. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to continue to renew its existing provider contracts or enter into new contracts.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Providers-If we lose our relationship, or our relationship otherwise changes in an unfavorable manner, with one or more key pharmacy providers or if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to obtain discounts on prescription purchases from retail pharmacies that can be utilized by our clients and their members. Our contracts with retail pharmacies, which are non-exclusive, are generally terminable by either party on short notice. If one or more of our top pharmacy chains elects to terminate its relationship with us, or if we are only able to continue our relationship on terms less favorable to us, access to retail pharmacies by our clients and their health plan members, and consequently our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Vendors-Our specialty pharmacies, pharmacy claims processing, and mail processing are dependent on our relationships with a limited number of vendors and suppliers and the loss of any of these relationships could significantly impact our ability to sustain our financial performance.\nWe acquire a substantial percentage of our specialty pharmacies prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Some of our agreements with these suppliers may be short-term and cancelable by either party without cause with a relatively short time-frame of prior notice. Further, certain parts of these agreements allow pricing and other terms of these relationships to be periodically adjusted based upon required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An additional risk related to supply is that many products dispensed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. If any products we dispense are in short supply for long periods of time, this could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we source from a limited number of vendors certain aspects of our pharmacy claims and mail processing capabilities. An interruption of service, termination or modification to the terms to any of these agreements may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Manufacturers-If we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators or if rebate payments we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers and rebate processing service providers decline, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe receive fees or other compensation from our clients, in some cases based upon the retention of rebate amounts paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators based on the use of selected drugs by members of health plans sponsored by our clients, all pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers often pay administrative fees to us based upon our provision of rebate administration\nservices under agreements with such manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators. Our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected if:\n\u25cf we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators;\n\u25cf we are unable to renew or finalize rebate contracts with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators in the future, or are unable to negotiate interim arrangements;\n\u25cf rebates decline due to the failure of our health plan sponsors to meet market share or other thresholds;\n\u25cf legal restrictions are imposed on the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer rebates or purchase our services relating to the administration of rebates;\n\u25cf pharmaceutical manufacturers choose not to offer rebates or purchase our services; or\n\u25cf rebates decline due to contracted branded products losing their patents.\nFluctuation in Operating Results-The Company experiences fluctuations in quarterly operating results and, as a consequence, the Company may fail to meet or exceed market expectations, which could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to seasonal and other factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in utilization levels by enrolled members of the Company\u2019s risk-based contracts, including seasonal utilization patterns (for example, members generally tend to seek services less during the third and fourth quarters of the year than in the first and second quarters of the year);\n\u25cf performance-based contractual adjustments to net revenue, reflecting utilization results or other performance measures;\n\u25cf changes in estimates for contractual adjustments under commercial contracts;\n\u25cf retrospective membership adjustments;\n\u25cf the timing of implementation of new contracts, enrollment changes and contract terminations;\n\u25cf pricing adjustments upon contract renewals;\n\u25cf the timing of acquisitions;\n\u25cf changes in estimates regarding medical costs and IBNR claims;\n\u25cf the timing of recognition of pharmacy revenues, including rebates and Medicare Part D; and\n\u25cf changes in estimates of contingent consideration.\nThese factors may affect the Company\u2019s quarterly and annual net revenue, expenses and profitability in the future and, accordingly, the Company may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nDependence on Government Spending-The Company can be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local healthcare policies, programs, funding and enrollments.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s net revenues are derived, directly or indirectly, from governmental agencies, including state Medicaid programs. Contract rates vary from state to state, are subject to periodic negotiation and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase rates. The Company is unable to predict the impact on the Company\u2019s operations of future regulations or legislation affecting Medicaid programs, or the healthcare industry in general. Future regulations or legislation may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, any reduction in government spending for such programs could also have a material adverse effect on the Company (See \u201cReliance on Customer Contracts\u201d). In addition, the Company\u2019s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, under both direct contract and subcontract arrangements, generally are conditioned upon financial appropriations by one or more governmental agencies, especially in the case of state Medicaid programs. These contracts generally can be terminated or modified by the customer if such appropriations are not made. The Company faces increased risks in this regard as state budgets have come under increasing pressure. Finally, some of the Company\u2019s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, under both direct contract and subcontract arrangements, require the Company to perform additional services if federal, state or local laws or regulations imposed after the contract is signed so require, in exchange for additional compensation, to be negotiated by the parties in good faith. Government and other third-party payors generally seek to impose lower contract rates and to renegotiate reduced contract rates with service providers in a trend toward cost control.\nRestrictive Covenants in the Company\u2019s Debt Instruments-Restrictions imposed by the Company\u2019s debt agreements limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility. These restrictions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance the Company\u2019s future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Company\u2019s interest.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company completed the public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 22, 2017 (the \u201cBase Indenture\u201d), between the Company, as issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of September 22, 2017 (the \u201cFirst Supplemental Indenture\u201d together, with the Base Indenture, the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased and subsequently retired $11.1 million of its Notes, which resulted in a loss on retirement of $0.3 million that is included in interest expense. The Notes were issued at a discount and had a carrying value of $399.3 million and $388.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants which restrict the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, create liens on its and its subsidiaries\u2019 assets; engage in sale and lease-back transactions; and engage in a consolidation, merger or sale of assets.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $350.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility to the Company, as the borrower (the \u201c2017 Credit Agreement\u201d). On August 13, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity date by one year. On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which amended the total leverage ratio covenant, and which was necessary in order for us to remain in compliance with the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 22, 2023.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating the Company\u2019s business by restricting or limiting the Company\u2019s ability, among other things, to:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred or redeemable stock;\n\u25cf pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u25cf repurchase equity interests;\n\u25cf make certain advances, investments and loans;\n\u25cf enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf sell and otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u25cf acquire or merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u25cf enter into some types of transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Company\u2019s interest. The 2017 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Failure to do so, unless waived by the lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, pursuant to its terms, or amended, would result in an event of default.\nRequired Assurances of Financial Resources-The Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, prospects and profitability can be adversely affected by present or future state regulations and contractual requirements that the Company provide financial assurance of the Company\u2019s ability to meet the Company\u2019s obligations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s contracts and certain state regulations require the Company or certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to maintain specified cash reserves or letters of credit and/or to maintain certain minimum tangible net equity in certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as assurance that the Company has financial resources to meet the Company\u2019s contractual obligations. Many of these state regulations also restrict the investment activity of certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Some state regulations also restrict the ability of certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends to Magellan. Additional state regulations could be promulgated that would increase the cash or other security the Company would be required to maintain. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may require additional restricted cash or other security with respect to the Company\u2019s obligations under the Company\u2019s contracts, including the Company\u2019s obligation to pay IBNR claims and other medical claims not yet processed and paid. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s contracts and state regulations limit the profits that the Company may earn on risk-based business. The Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, prospects and profitability could be adversely affected by the effects of such regulations and contractual provisions. See Note 2-\u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies-Restricted Assets\u201d to the consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere herein for a discussion of the Company\u2019s restricted assets.\nCompetition-The competitive environment in the managed healthcare industry may limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the Company\u2019s rates, which would limit or adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, and any failure in the Company\u2019s ability to respond adequately may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain contracts or obtain new contracts.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly competitive. The Company competes with other healthcare organizations as well as with insurance companies, including HMOs, PPOs, TPAs, IPAs, multi-disciplinary medical groups, PBMs, specialty pharmacy companies, radiology benefits management companies and other specialty healthcare and managed care companies. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, particularly certain insurance companies, HMOs and PBMs are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company, which can create downward pressure on prices through economies of scale. The entrance or expansion of these larger companies in the managed healthcare industry (including the Company\u2019s customers who have in-sourced or who may choose to in-source healthcare services) could increase the competitive pressures the Company faces and could limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the Company\u2019s rates. If this happens, the Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if the Company does not adequately respond to these competitive pressures, it could cause the Company to not be able to maintain its current contracts or to not be able to obtain new contracts.\nPossible Impact of Federal Healthcare Reform Law-can significantly impact the Company\u2019s revenues or profitability.\nThe ACA is a comprehensive piece of legislation that made significant changes to the healthcare system in the United States. The ACA contains various effective dates extending through 2020.\nSignificant provisions in the ACA include minimum medical loss ratios for health insurance issuers, significant changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and many other changes that affect healthcare insurance and managed care.\nThrough 2020 the ACA contains provisions related to fees that impact the Company\u2019s direct public sector contracts and provisions regarding the non-deductibility of those fees. Our state public sector customers have made rate adjustments to cover the direct costs of these fees and a majority of the impact from non-deductibility of such fees for income tax purposes. There may be some impact due to taxes paid for non-renewing customers where the timing and amount of recoupment of these additional costs are uncertain. There can be no assurances that public sector customers may make rate adjustments to cover the direct costs of these fees in the future, so there can be no guarantees regarding this adjustment from our state public sector customers and these taxes and fees may have a material impact on the Company. Congress has repealed this ACA provision, effective for plan years after December 31, 2020.\nPossible Impact of Federal Mental Health Parity-could impact the Company\u2019s revenues or profitability.\nIn October 2008, the United States Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Dominici Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 (\u201cMHPAEA\u201d) establishing parity in financial requirements (e.g. co-pays, deductibles, etc.) and treatment limitations (e.g., limits on the number of visits) between mental health and substance abuse benefits and medical/surgical benefits for health plan members. The law applies to ERISA plans, Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP plans. In 2010 regulations were issued that apply to ERISA plans and insured business. These regulations included some significant concepts not included under the statute including the requirement to conduct the parity review at the category level within the plan, introducing the concept of non-quantitative treatment limitations, and prohibiting separate but equal deductibles. In 2016 regulations were released imposing similar requirements and concepts on Medicaid Managed Care. The Company believes it is in compliance with the requirements of these regulations however additional guidance or new parity laws could impact the business. The Company\u2019s risk contracts do allow for repricing to occur effective the same date that any legislation/regulation becomes effective if that legislation/regulation is projected to have a material effect on cost of care.\nGovernment Regulation-The Company is subject to substantial government regulation and scrutiny, which increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe managed healthcare industry is subject to extensive and evolving federal and state regulation. Such laws and regulations cover, but are not limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government healthcare program participation requirements, information privacy and security, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. The Company\u2019s pharmaceutical management business is also the subject of substantial federal and state governmental regulation and scrutiny.\nThe Company is subject to certain state laws and regulations and federal laws as a result of the Company\u2019s role in management of customers\u2019 employee benefit plans.\nRegulatory issues may also affect the Company\u2019s operations including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf additional state licenses that may be required to conduct the Company\u2019s businesses, including utilization review, PBM, pharmacy, HMO and TPA activities;\n\u25cf limits imposed by state authorities upon corporations\u2019 control or excessive influence over managed healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists or other professionals, and prohibiting fee splitting;\n\u25cf laws that impose financial terms and requirements on the Company due to the Company\u2019s assumption of risk under contracts with licensed insurance companies or HMOs;\n\u25cf laws in certain states that impose an obligation to contract with any healthcare provider willing to meet the terms of the Company\u2019s contracts with similar providers;\n\u25cf compliance with HIPAA (including the federal HITECH Act, which strengthens and expands HIPAA) and other federal and state laws impacting the confidentiality of member information;\n\u25cf state legislation regulating PBMs or imposing fiduciary status on PBMs;\n\u25cf pharmacy laws and regulation;\n\u25cf legislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions, which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans; and\n\u25cf network pharmacy access laws, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d legislation, that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts.\nThe imposition of additional licensing and other regulatory requirements may, among other things, increase the Company\u2019s equity requirements, increase the cost of doing business or force significant changes in the Company\u2019s operations to comply with these requirements. In this regard, in a case pending before the United States Supreme Court, Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the Court will have the opportunity to clarify the proper role of the states in connection with the administration of employer sponsored benefit plans. A decision in this case is expected by June 2020.\nThe costs associated with compliance with government regulation as discussed above may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nProposed changes to current Federal law and regulations could have a material and adverse impact on our PBM business.\nThere are various proposed federal laws that could change some aspects of our pharmacy benefit management business. For example, the laws, if enacted, could require the pass-through of all rebate amounts to customer, or prohibit the use of \u201ctraditional\u201d pricing, under which a pharmacy benefit manager pays a pharmacy one price under its pharmacy contract, and charges a different price to the customer based on the terms of the customer contract. These and other changes, if enacted into law, may change the manner in which industry participants contract with customers, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether such alternative contract structures would be materially less profitable than current contracts.\nNoncompliance with Regulations-Noncompliance with regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including from monetary or criminal liabilities and penalties, investigations or regulatory actions, additional compliance requirements, heightened governmental scrutiny, or exclusion from participating in government programs.\nExtensive laws and regulation are applicable to all of our business operations. In addition to laws and regulations generally applicable to our business, the Company is subject to other federal laws and regulations in connection with its contracts with the federal government. These laws and regulations affect how the Company conducts business with its federal agency customers and may impose added costs on its business. Noncompliance by the Company with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment investigations and allegations have become more frequent concerning possible violations of statutes and regulations by healthcare organizations. The Company also conducts its own investigations into these matters and may choose to self-report its findings to governmental agencies. Violations by the Company with certain laws and regulations may result in it being excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subject to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed services. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with federal procurement laws and regulations could cause it to lose business, incur additional costs and subject it to a variety of civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. In addition, alleged violations may result in litigation or regulatory action. A subsequent legal liability or a significant regulatory action against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if the Company ultimately prevails in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, such litigation, regulatory action or investigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also receives notifications from and engages in discussions with various government agencies concerning the Company\u2019s businesses and operations. As a result of these contacts with regulators, the Company may, as appropriate, be required to implement changes to the Company\u2019s operations, revise the Company\u2019s filings with such agencies and/or seek additional licenses to conduct the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s inability to comply with the various regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nReference is made to information set forth under \u201cRegulation-Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations\u201d under Item 1 of this Report.\nMedicare Part D-The Company\u2019s participation in Medicare Part D is subject to government regulation and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThere are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program, and we can give no assurance these risks will not materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s results. Certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries have been approved by CMS to offer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to individual beneficiaries and employer groups. Such subsidiaries are required to comply with Medicare Part D laws and regulations and, because CMS requires that Medicare Part D sponsors be licensed as risk-bearing entities, also with applicable state laws and regulations regarding the business of insurance. The Company also provides services in support of our clients\u2019 Medicare Part D plans and must be able to deliver such services in a manner that complies with applicable regulatory requirements. We have made substantial investments in both human resources and the technology required to administer Medicare Part D benefits. The adoption of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements associated with Medicare Part D may require us to incur significant costs or otherwise impact our ability to earn a profit on such business. In addition, the Company\u2019s receipt of federal funds made available through the Medicare Part D program is subject to compliance with the laws and regulations governing the federal government\u2019s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the Federal Anti-Kickback law and False Claims Acts. If we fail to comply materially with applicable regulatory or contractual requirements, whether identified through CMS or other government audits, client audits, or otherwise, we may be subject to certain sanctions, penalties, or other remedies, including, but not limited to, suspension of marketing or enrollment activities, restrictions on expanding our service area, civil monetary penalties or other monetary amounts, termination of our contract(s) with CMS or Part D clients, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.\nMedicare and Medicaid: Quality and Performance Measures - Failure to maintain satisfactory quality and performance measures may negatively affect our premium rates, subject us to penalties, limit or reduce our membership, or impede our ability to compete for new business in existing or new markets or result in the termination of our contracts, affect our ability to establish new health plans or expand current health plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nQuality scores are used by certain regulatory agencies to establish premium rates and/or calculate performance incentives. In the case of CMS, for example, quality-based metrics are used to pay quality bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that enable high scoring plans to offer enhanced health benefits for their MA beneficiaries.\nMA and Part D Plans with Star Ratings of four (4.0) stars or higher are eligible for year-round open enrollment; conversely, plans with lower Star Ratings have more restricted times for enrollment of beneficiaries. MA and Part D Plans with Star Ratings of less than three (3.0) stars in three consecutive years are denoted as \"low performing\" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS \"Medicare and You\" handbook. In addition, in 2018 CMS had its authority reinstated to terminate MA and Part D Plans contracts for plans rated below three (3.0) stars in three consecutive years. CMS may begin terminations of low rated plans of MA and Part D Plans beginning with plan year 2023. As a result, MA Plans and Part D that achieve higher Star Ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star Ratings. As a result, lower quality scores/Star ratings compared to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth, results of operation, financial condition, or cash flows. Magellan\u2019s PDP has been noted as a low performing plan by CMS, which could impact its ability to obtain members through the auto-assignment process or its expansion opportunities, however, the Company does not anticipate that any such impact would be material.\nFor certain state Medicaid programs, plans that do not meet applicable quality and service measures may be subject to a range of penalties including being placed on a corrective action plan, denial of quality performance incentives, financial sanctions, reduction in capitation, enrollment limitations or termination of contract. We are unable to predict with any certainty what actions a state may take, if any, when assessing our contractual performance.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory quality and service measures could also adversely affect our ability to establish new health plans or expand the business of our existing health plans. In addition, lower quality scores or Star ratings, when compared to our competitors, may adversely affect our ability to attract members and obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansions, including expansion of Medicare Advantage health plans, or succeed in competitive bidding situations.\nThe Company faces risks related to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member and other information.\nAs part of its normal operations, the Company collects, processes and retains confidential member information making the Company subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information, including HIPAA. The Company also maintains other confidential information related to its business and operations. Despite appropriate security measures, the Company is subject to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, GDPR) or any security breach, whether by the Company or by its vendors, could result in enforcement actions, material fines and penalties and could also subject the Company to litigation.\nIT Systems - The Company\u2019s ability to effectively maintain and upgrade its information systems is critical to its business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent on effective information systems. Our information systems require routine maintenance, enhancements and upgrades in order to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements. The maintenance, upgrade and enhancement of our information systems requires significant economic resources. If the Company encounters difficulties in its information systems, or with the transition to or from its information systems, or does not appropriately maintain, enhance and upgrade its information systems, such events could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, our ability to manage effectively our information systems could be impacted by events outside of our control, including acts of nature, such as floods, earthquakes, fires, or acts of terrorism.\nCyber-Security-The Company faces risks related to a breach or failure in our operational security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business.\nOur business requires us to securely store, process and transmit confidential, proprietary and other information in our operations. Security breaches may arise from computer hackers penetrating our systems and approaching our employees to obtain personal information for financial gain, attempting to cause harm to our operations, or intending to obtain competitive information. Our data assets and systems are also subject to attack by viruses, worms, phishing attempts and other malicious software programs. We maintain a comprehensive system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs; however, our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks, and we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or employee or vendor malfeasance. The costs to update our security protocols to mitigate a security breach could be significant. A breach or failure in our operational security systems may result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member or employee information and could result in significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other losses, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\nWe contract with third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. Some of these third-parties also have direct access to our systems. Our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data or the information and data relating to our members or customers. We are also at risk of a data security incident involving a vendor or third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party\u2019s data protection processes or cyber-attackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party.\nTo the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a data security incident that compromises its operations, we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption, which could have an adverse effect on our business and\noperations. In addition, we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures or incidents under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements.\nAny contractual remedies and/or indemnification obligations we may have for vendor or service provider failures or incidents may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses suffered as a result of any vendor\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations to us or under applicable law. Further, we may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of our contracts with third party vendors and service providers. Our outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in vendors\u2019 or service providers\u2019 operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control.\nIf we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk, including significant cybersecurity risk. Violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business (including, but not limited to, GDPR) or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members, providers, or other third parties, or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business. In turn, this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. Moreover, if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms, and may incur significant costs and/or disruption to our operations in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our members or customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed. In addition, we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers, as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing, unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party, vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and/or regulations, or otherwise. This could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe Company faces additional regulatory risks associated with its Pharmacy Management segment which could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and liability and which could adversely affect the profitability of the Pharmacy Management segment in the future.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s Pharmacy Management segment are governed by federal and state laws and regulations. Pharmaceutical management services are provided by the Company to Medicaid and Medicare plans as well as commercial insurance plans. There has been enhanced scrutiny on federal programs and the Company must remain vigilant in ensuring compliance with the requirements of these programs. Significant sanctions may be imposed for violations of these laws and compliance programs are a significant operational requirement of the Company\u2019s business. There are significant uncertainties involving the application of many of these legal requirements to the Company. Accordingly, the Company may be required to incur additional administrative and compliance expenses in determining the applicable requirements and in adapting its compliance practices, or modifying its business practices, in order to satisfy changing interpretations and regulatory policies. In addition, there are numerous proposed healthcare laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, many of which, if adopted, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. See \u201cRegulation\u201d above.\nRisks Related to Realization of Goodwill and Intangible Assets-The Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected if the value of intangible assets is not fully realized.\nThe Company\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2019 reflect goodwill of approximately $1.0 billion, representing approximately 32.9 percent of total assets. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2019, noting that no impairment was identified.\nAt December 31, 2019, identifiable intangible assets (customer lists, contracts, provider networks and trade names) totaled approximately $167.3 million. Intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from approximately one to eighteen years. The amortization periods used may differ from those used by other entities. In addition, the Company may be required to shorten the amortization period for intangible assets in future periods based on changes in the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that such goodwill or intangible assets will be realizable.\nThe Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether for any reason the carrying value of the Company\u2019s intangible assets and other long-lived assets may no longer be completely recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings for impairment losses could become necessary. When events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets other than goodwill by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the future cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.\nThe 2018 annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2018, determined that the fair value of the MCC reporting unit had declined, largely due to continued economic challenges in certain markets, and was in excess of its carrying value by a margin of approximately 5%, designating it as a reporting unit that was at-risk for impairment. After performing the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, improvements were noted in the actual and expected results for such MCC markets which increased the estimated fair value of the MCC reporting unit. As of October 1, 2019, the excess of its fair value over the carrying value increased to an extent that it is no longer considered at-risk.\nWhile no units were determined to be impaired at this time, reporting unit goodwill is at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the Company\u2019s forecasted future results and cash flows. In addition, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates or discount rates, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. For testing purposes, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\nExamples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, a decrease in membership or rates or customer attrition and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession); and (iii) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted average cost of capital.\nBased on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate. These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses.\nWhile historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.\nAny event or change in circumstances leading to a future determination requiring write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets or goodwill would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nClaims for Professional Liability-Pending or future actions or claims for professional liability (including any associated judgments, settlements, legal fees and other costs) could require the Company to make significant cash expenditures and consume significant management time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operating activities entail significant risks of liability. In recent years, participants in the healthcare industry generally, as well as the managed healthcare industry, have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits. From time to time, the Company is subject to various actions and claims of professional liability alleging negligence in performing utilization review and other managed healthcare activities, as well as for the acts or omissions of the Company\u2019s employees, including employed physicians and other clinicians, network providers, pharmacists, or others. In the normal course of business, the Company receives reports relating to deaths and other serious incidents involving patients whose care is being managed by the Company. Such incidents occasionally give rise to malpractice, professional negligence and other related actions and claims against the Company, the Company\u2019s employees or the Company\u2019s network providers. The Company is also subject to actions and claims for the costs of services for which\npayment was denied. Many of these actions and claims seek substantial damages and require the Company to incur significant fees and costs related to the Company\u2019s defense and consume significant management time and resources. While the Company maintains professional liability insurance, there can be no assurance that future actions or claims for professional liability (including any judgments, settlements or costs associated therewith) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nProfessional Liability and Other Insurance-Claims brought against the Company that exceed the scope of the Company\u2019s liability coverage or denial of coverage could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company maintains a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks in the Company\u2019s business. As part of this program of insurance, the Company carries professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and self-insured retentions. The Company also is sometimes required by customer contracts to post surety bonds with respect to the Company\u2019s potential liability on professional responsibility claims that may be asserted in connection with services the Company provides. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $83.8 million of such bonds outstanding. The Company\u2019s insurance may not be sufficient to cover any judgments, settlements or costs relating to present or future claims, suits or complaints. Upon expiration of the Company\u2019s insurance policies, sufficient insurance may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent the Company\u2019s customers are entitled to indemnification under their contracts with the Company relating to liabilities they incur arising from the operation of the Company\u2019s programs, such indemnification may not be covered under the Company\u2019s insurance policies. To the extent that certain actions and claims seek punitive and compensatory damages arising from the Company\u2019s alleged intentional misconduct, such damages, if awarded, may not be covered, in whole or in part, by the Company\u2019s insurance policies. If the Company is unable to secure adequate insurance in the future, or if the insurance the Company carries is not sufficient to cover any judgments, settlements or costs relating to any present or future actions or claims, such judgments, settlements or costs may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. If the Company is unable to obtain needed surety bonds in adequate amounts or make alternative arrangements to satisfy the requirements for such bonds, the Company may no longer be able to operate in those states, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nClass Action Suits and Other Legal Proceedings-The Company is subject to class action and other lawsuits that could result in material liabilities to the Company or cause the Company to incur material costs, to change the Company\u2019s operating procedures in ways that increase costs or to comply with additional regulatory requirements.\nManaged healthcare companies and PBM companies have been targeted as defendants in national class action lawsuits regarding their business practices. The Company is subject to such national class actions as defendants and is also subject to or a party to other class actions, lawsuits and legal proceedings in conducting the Company\u2019s business, including but not limited to, claims by network providers. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s customers are parties to pending class action lawsuits regarding the customers\u2019 business practices for which the customers could seek indemnification from the Company. These lawsuits may take years to resolve and cause the Company to incur substantial litigation expense, and the outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. In addition to potential damage awards, depending upon the outcomes of such cases, these lawsuits may cause or force changes in practices of the Company\u2019s industry and may also cause additional regulation of the industry through new federal or state laws or new applications of existing laws or regulations. Such changes could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs.\nNegative Publicity-The Company may be subject to negative publicity which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the managed healthcare industry has received negative publicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, review of industry practices and private litigation. These factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to market our services, require the Company to change its services, or increase the overall regulatory burden under which the Company operates. Any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInvestment Portfolio-The value of the Company\u2019s investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income.\nAll of the Company\u2019s investments are classified as \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d and are carried at fair value. The Company\u2019s available-for-sale investment securities were $345.2 million and represented 11.2 percent of the Company\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2019.\nThe current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. The Company believes it has adequately reviewed its investment securities for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change the Company\u2019s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses. In addition, if it became necessary for the Company to liquidate its investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAdverse Economic Conditions-Adverse changes in national economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nChanges in national economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reimbursement from state Medicaid programs in its Healthcare segment. Adverse economic conditions could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s customers in the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments resulting in increased pressures on the Company\u2019s operating margins. In addition, economic conditions may result in decreased membership in the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments, thereby adversely affecting the revenues to the Company from such customers as well as the Company\u2019s operating profitability.\nAdverse economic conditions in the debt markets could affect the Company\u2019s ability to refinance the Company\u2019s existing Credit Agreement upon its maturity on acceptable terms, or at all.\nTalent Management - The Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees and manage the succession and retention of key executives is critical to our success.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the Company\u2019s success. There is competition among potential employers for qualified and experienced employees and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to attract or retain such employees. In addition, competition among potential employers could result in increased salaries and benefits. If the Company is unable to retain its employees, or attract additional employees, such events could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe Company also could be impacted adversely if the Company is unable to plan adequately for the succession of executives and senior management. The Company has succession plans in place, however, such plans do not guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our margin improvement initiatives and plans, or if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of those initiatives and plans, our business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn December 2018, we announced the implementation of a margin and profitability improvement plan. The margin improvement plan includes flattening our organizational structure, standardizing our healthcare administrative functions and automating certain core operating processes.\nOur initiatives may create uncertainties, including the effect of the initiatives and plan on our business, operations, revenues, and profitability, potential disruptions to our business as a result of management\u2019s attention to the initiatives and plan, uncertainty regarding the potential amount and timing of future cost savings associated with the initiatives and plan, and the potential negative impact of the initiatives and plan on employee morale. The success of the initiatives and plan will depend, in part, on factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we can provide no\nassurance that the goals of the initiatives and plan will be fully achieved. Failure in this regard could have a material and adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S., and our operations, plans and results of operations are affected by tax and other initiatives. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), corporate tax rates in the United States decreased in 2018, which resulted in changes to our valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These changes in valuation were material to our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or other changes in tax laws.", "PERMNO": 90011, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "MGLN"}
