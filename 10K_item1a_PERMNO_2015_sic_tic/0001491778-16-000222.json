{"cik": "1491778", "company": "Angie's List, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and future prospects. These risks are not the only risks facing us as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may become important factors that may materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and you may lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nPrior to 2015, we incurred annual net losses each year since inception, and we may incur additional net losses as we invest to grow and penetrate our markets in the future.\nPrior to 2015, we incurred annual net losses each year since inception. As a result, our accumulated deficit was $254.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Consequently, we have primarily funded our operations through equity and debt financings. Key elements of our growth strategy include growing and strengthening our membership and service provider bases and penetration rates in each of the markets where we offer our services as well as enhancing consumer engagement in our marketplace. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase as we expand our member and service provider bases, develop new marketing initiatives, incentivize consumers to interact and transact on our platforms, enhance our technology platform and launch new products and services. These planned investments may result in additional net losses or negative cash flow impacts. Further, if our revenue does not grow or declines, or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, we may not become profitable on a sustained basis, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability to develop, implement and evolve our profitable growth plan and initiatives may adversely impact future results.\nOur ability to succeed in developing, implementing and evolving our profitable growth plan and initiatives could require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from other business initiatives or opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges to economies of scale in our marketplace, sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, evolve and successfully implement our profitable growth plan and initiatives to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we cannot successfully execute our profitable growth plan and initiatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to introduce new or upgraded services or features that consumers and service providers recognize as valuable, we may fail to generate additional consumer traffic to our platforms or attract and retain members and service providers. Our efforts to develop new and upgraded services and products could require us to incur significant costs.\nIn order to generate consumer traffic to our platforms and attract and retain members and service providers, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, services and features that add value for consumers and service providers and differentiate us from our competitors. The success of new products, services and features depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. If consumers and service providers do not recognize the value of our new services or features, they may choose not to utilize or advertise on our platforms.\nWe may experience difficulties in developing and delivering new or upgraded products, services and features, which may increase our expenses. Moreover, we cannot ensure that new or upgraded products, services or features will work as intended or provide value to consumers and service providers. Additionally, some new or upgraded products, services or features may be complex and challenging to effectively market to consumers and may also involve additional changes to our current pricing tiers.\nWe cannot guarantee that our current members and service providers or new consumers will respond favorably to new products, services or features. Furthermore, there are inherent risks associated with our efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use, responsiveness, functionality and features of our existing platforms, and we may not be able to manage such enhancements and improvements successfully. We may also choose to license or otherwise integrate applications, content and data from third parties, which may impose costs on our business and require the use of our resources. We may be unable to continue to access such applications, content or data on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur membership renewal rates may decrease, and any decrease could harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur members, most of whom are on annual or multi-year membership plans, may not renew their membership at the conclusion of their membership term, and if they do renew, they may do so at a lower membership tier. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the decision to offer our ratings and reviews for free, additional pricing changes in the future, adjustments to our product or service offerings, competitive pressures or general customer satisfaction, among other things. If our membership renewal rates decline, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in membership acquisition. If the revenue generated by new memberships varies significantly from our expectations, or if our membership acquisition costs or costs associated with servicing our members increase, we may not be able to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from this investment.\nWe spent $71.5 million and $87.4 million on marketing expenditures in 2015 and 2014, respectively, much of which was for the intended purpose of acquiring new paid members, in addition to highlighting our e-commerce offerings and generating consumer traffic in our marketplace. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire additional members, primarily through national offline and online advertising, including digital marketing platforms. Our analysis of the revenue that we expect new memberships to generate over their lifetimes depends on several estimates and assumptions, including membership tiers, membership renewal rates, future membership fees, e-commerce purchased by our members and incremental advertising and e-commerce revenue from service providers driven by increased penetration in a particular market. We intend to continue to evaluate and adopt innovative packaging, pricing and monetization strategies, such as tiered membership offerings, in an effort to deliver compelling value to our members and thereby support membership growth and retention. Our experience, estimates and assumptions in markets in which our penetration rates are presently lower may differ from our more established markets.\nIf our estimates and assumptions regarding the revenue we can generate from new memberships prove incorrect, we may be unable to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from our investment in acquiring new memberships. Moreover, if our membership acquisition costs or the costs associated with servicing our members increase, the return on our investment may be lower than we anticipate irrespective of the revenue generated by new memberships. If we cannot generate profits from this investment, our growth rate, business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically demonstrated, and is likely to continue to exhibit, volatility, and could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, as of February 15, 2016, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in November 2011 at a price of $13.00 per share, our trading price has ranged from $3.73 to $28.32. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the risk factors discussed herein, these factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nour new profitable growth plan and initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our business;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, changes in securities analysts\u2019 projections or recommendations, withdrawal of research coverage or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall stock market or in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. We are currently the subject of multiple stockholder class action lawsuits. These lawsuits, and any future stockholder class action lawsuits initiated against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and therefore harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the implementation of our profitable growth plan, we are introducing a new free membership tier for consumers. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to monetize our free member traffic with service provider revenue, our business may suffer, and our growth rate, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nOn March 3, 2016 we announced a new profitable growth plan featuring a redefined product and service experience for both consumers and service providers. Our new model will provide consumers with revamped tiered membership options offering an array of premium services at varying price points and includes a free membership tier for consumers that will remove our ratings and reviews paywall for the first time. The introduction of a free membership tier for consumers may ultimately yield reductions in our membership revenue over time. If we are unable to effectively monetize our free member traffic with service provider revenue, our business may suffer, and our growth rate, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nOur membership focus may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.\nWe generally strive to make decisions that we believe to be in the best long-term interests of our members, which we believe is essential to our success in increasing our membership growth rates and engagement and creating value for our members. Therefore, in the past, we have forgone, and may in the future forgo, certain short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the bests interests of our members, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the near term. Additionally, our philosophy of putting our members first may cause disagreements, or negatively impact our relationships, with our existing or prospective service providers, thereby potentially yielding declines in service provider penetration, engagement or revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on the strength of our brand, which is built on a foundation of authentic reviews and the trust of consumers, and the failure to maintain that authenticity and trust would damage our brand and harm our ability to maintain or expand our membership and service provider bases.\nTrust in the integrity of the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d brand and in the objective, unbiased nature of our ratings and reviews contributes significantly to our ability to attract new members and service providers. Maintaining consumer trust and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to maintain our commitment to and reputation for placing the interests of the consumer first. If our existing or potential members perceive that we are not focused on helping them make more informed purchasing decisions about local services transactions or that the revenue we receive from service providers interferes with the objective rating of service providers on the basis of member reviews, our reputation and the strength of our brand would be adversely affected. Complaints or negative publicity about our sales and business practices, products and services, personnel or customer service, irrespective of their validity, or data privacy and security issues could diminish consumers\u2019 confidence in our service and adversely impact our brand.\nTrust in our brand also will suffer if we are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of the ratings and reviews that appear on Angie\u2019s List. We collect reviews from consumers and make these reviews available to members on our website and mobile applications. While we utilize various technology-based algorithms and filters to detect fraudulent reviews, and we believe that our prohibition of anonymous reviews provides a degree of traceability and accountability not present on other websites, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of our reviews. Moreover, as our membership base expands and the number of service providers rated and reviewed by our members grows, we may see an increase in fraudulent or inaccurate reviews. If fraudulent or inaccurate reviews - positive or negative - increase on Angie\u2019s List, and we are unable to effectively identify and remove such reviews, the overall quality of our ratings and reviews would decrease, our reputation as a source of trusted ratings and reviews may be harmed and consumers and service providers may be deterred from using our products and services. We employ steps designed to ensure that reviews are not inaccurate or fraudulent and that service providers are rated based solely on their reviews and not on the basis of any other factor, such as their advertising with us. If such steps prove ineffective or if members otherwise believe that we are not objective, we could lose their trust, and our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nIn addition, our brand could be harmed if others use any of our trademarks inappropriately. For example, service providers may use our trademarks without our permission, including our \u201cSuper Service Award,\u201d which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken, and will in the future take, action, including initiating litigation, to protect our trademarks and the integrity of our brand. If such efforts are unsuccessful, our brand and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our debt facility limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur debt and liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nmake redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt, other than under our debt facility;\n\u2022\nengage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nchange our business;\n\u2022\namend our material agreements;\n\u2022\nissue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrict distributions from subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ngrant negative pledges to other creditors.\nThe debt facility also contains financial covenants that require us to achieve certain minimum levels of membership revenue and EBITDA and to maintain minimum levels of liquidity. The debt facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and, through a delayed draw term loan facility, provides a source of liquidity to enable us to fund our current and future operations. A breach of any of the covenants or requirements in the debt facility could result in a default under the debt facility, unless we are able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not waived, and subject to any appropriate cure periods, the lenders could elect to exercise any of their available remedies, which may include the right to not lend any additional amounts to us or, in certain instances, to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the borrowings with respect to the debt facility when due, the lender would be permitted to proceed against our collateral. If the lender takes any or all of these steps, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted, and we may be unable to continue to fund our operations.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, and members and service providers may curtail or terminate their use of our service.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our consumers, service providers and employees, in our data centers and networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our service involves the storage and transmission of our members\u2019 and service providers\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, resulting in potential litigation and liability. Further, our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud, and could result in fines by credit card companies or the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments.\nDespite the precautionary measures we have in place, we are subject to a number of risks related to intentional business disruptions, cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, piracy and other security risks, and we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our members\u2019 or service providers' data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such events could adversely affect our competitive position, reputation, brand or future sales of our products, and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose members and service providers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf security measures at third parties are breached, our ability to automatically renew memberships or process service provider payment commitments could be harmed.\nMany of our members and service providers shop at third parties, including retailers such as Target and Home Depot, and pay by credit card at such places. While we assume that third parties adequately protect their customers\u2019 personal information, including bank account and credit card details, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to such personal information change frequently, and third parties may be unable to implement sufficient preventive measures to protect that information. If any of our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 bank account or credit card information is compromised by a security breach at a third-party, any such members or service providers may be forced to open a new bank account or obtain a new credit card, and the payment information we have on file for those impacted members and service providers would no longer be valid, impairing our ability to automatically renew the affected members\u2019 accounts or process service providers\u2019 payment commitments. Our inability to automatically renew memberships and process service provider payment commitments may have a significant negative impact on our revenue, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nInterruptions or delays in service arising from our technology infrastructure could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe rely in part upon third-party co-location technology facilities and cloud-based data services vendors, including data center, Internet infrastructure and bandwidth, as well as payment processing vendors, none of which are under our control, to provide our products and services to our consumers and service providers. Our own internal facilities as well as the external third-party technology facilities and vendors we utilize are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, cyber-attacks, the failure of physical, administrative and technical security measures, terrorist acts, human error, financial insolvency of third-party providers or other unanticipated problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our service and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained on our systems or stored and delivered on our behalf by third-party vendors and facilities. Our disaster recovery capabilities may not be able to fully support our technology infrastructure in the event of interruption or delay. As our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our systems and our overall operations, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in a loss of existing or potential consumers and service providers or increase our technology maintenance and support costs, all of which would adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Further, our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses that may occur as a result of any such interruptions or delays.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our systems and our overall operations. Certain aspects of our technology infrastructure run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain the primary elements of this system, but some elements of this system are operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace, thereby increasing our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with cloud computing technologies and information services could negatively impact our brand and reputation, our relationship with our consumers and service providers or our ability to attract, retain and serve our consumers and service providers.\nIn addition, we designed and developed key aspects of the software code and technical infrastructure for the technology platforms through which we provide our products and services, and we plan to continue to maintain and develop certain elements of our technology platforms internally. Our software code and technical infrastructure are complex, and such efforts may therefore lead to increased product and technology expense, operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products and services. These issues may not be identified immediately, which could result in further interruption, degradation or cost, thereby resulting in potential adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our efforts to increase memberships, retain existing paid memberships and maintain high levels of member engagement are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business and generate both membership revenue and service provider revenue depends in part on attracting new members, retaining our existing paid membership base, maintaining high levels of consumer engagement and attracting consumers to utilize our e-commerce marketplace. It is important that we convince prospective members of the benefits of our premium services and existing members of its continuing value. In addition, it is also imperative that we elicit submissions of reviews of service providers to our database. Driving membership revenue generally entails increased penetration and active member engagement in each of our markets to both grow our database of reviews of service providers and enhance the value of our service to other members and prospective members. We also depend on growing our membership base as a means for increasing our service provider revenue via higher advertising rates and more active participation by service providers in our advertising and\ne-commerce initiatives. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in expanding our membership base, maintaining our existing paid membership base or in increasing our revenue per membership.\nIn addition, we rely upon high membership renewal rates and \u201cword of mouth\u201d referrals from existing members to maintain and grow our paid membership base. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to maintain our renewal rates or continue receiving referrals. Furthermore, although we use our number of paid memberships as an indicator of the growth of our business, some of our members may not actively utilize our service or submit reviews of service providers to our database. If member engagement does not meet our expectations, we may lose members or service providers who advertise with us, and our revenue may be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to increase the number of memberships and to maintain high levels of member engagement will require us to continually address a number of challenges, and we may fail to do so successfully. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to build our database of ratings and reviews of service providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number and variety of service providers reviewed by our consumers;\n\u2022\nconvincing consumers of the benefits of our premium service and making it easy for them to become paid members and purchase services;\n\u2022\nproviding membership plans that offer desirable benefits and levels of service at attractive price points;\n\u2022\ndelivering an optimal member experience, including relevant, high-quality discounts and deals and other promotional offers from our participating service providers and compelling, easy-to-use e-commerce offerings; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors.\nOur inability to increase the number of memberships and to maintain high levels of member engagement could negatively impact our growth prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to effectively develop and sell additional products, services and features, including our e-commerce marketplace initiatives.\nWe invest in the development of new products, services and features with the expectation that we will be able to effectively deliver them to consumers and service providers. For example, during 2015, we introduced our Angie's Fair Price Guarantee and Angie's Service Quality Guarantee initiatives and launched LeadFeed, a service designed to capture demand from non-member consumers visiting our site and turn that demand into leads for our service providers.\nWe are making substantial investments of time and resources in the development of our e-commerce marketplace strategy wherein we act as an intermediary in local service transactions. Acceptance of this business model by consumers and service providers is not assured and may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. We continue to experiment with the design, pricing and monetization of our e-commerce marketplace, and we may fail to provide offers that are desirable to consumers or advertising and e-commerce opportunities that are attractive to service providers. Further, if our competitors begin following a similar marketplace strategy, our prospects for success with respect to our marketplace initiatives may be adversely affected.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to effectively sell new products, services and features as well as additional enhancements to our existing offerings. As our new product and service offerings evolve, we adapt our sales and marketing strategies accordingly, and changes in these strategies may delay or prevent growth in certain aspects of our business. For example, we continue to refine our service provider eligibility criteria, pricing and monetization strategies, including e-commerce take rates, which may cause our revenue from advertising and e-commerce to fluctuate from period to period in the future. As many of our current and potential participating service providers have modest advertising budgets, there is no guarantee that the successful introduction of new products or services will not adversely affect sales of our current products and services or that those service providers that currently advertise or provide e-commerce offers with us will increase their aggregate spending as a result of the introduction of new products and services. If our efforts to effectively develop and sell additional products, services and features are not successful, our business, growth prospects, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nAny failure to convince service providers of the benefits of advertising or selling e-commerce on our platforms could harm our business.\nFor 2015 and 2014, we derived 80% and 77%, respectively, of our revenue from service providers, and we expect to continue to generate an increasing portion of our revenue from service providers in the future. Our ability to attract, retain and deepen our relationships with service providers and, ultimately, to generate revenue from service providers depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the number of memberships in our markets;\n\u2022\nmaintaining high levels of member and service provider engagement;\n\u2022\nenticing consumers to engage and transact via our e-commerce marketplace;\n\u2022\ncompeting effectively for advertising dollars with other online and offline advertising providers;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to enhance our advertising and e-commerce packaging and pricing strategies; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping new products, services and features that are attractive to both consumers and service providers.\nWe offer both offline and online advertising products as well as an array of e-commerce opportunities to eligible service providers, and our business depends, in part, on service providers\u2019 willingness to engage in our advertising and e-commerce initiatives. Service providers may view our advertising or e-commerce products as experimental, may choose not to advertise or engage in e-commerce with us or may leave us for competing alternatives upon expiration or termination of their agreements with us. Failure to demonstrate the value of our products and services to service providers could result in reduced spending by, or loss of, existing or potential future participating service providers, which could materially harm our business, revenue or financial condition.\nWe generally do not employ local \u201cfeet on the street\u201d sales personnel to sell advertising or pitch e-commerce to service providers and instead rely on call center sales personnel. The resulting lack of a personal connection with service providers may impede us in growing or maintaining service provider revenue. As we expand our business, it will be important for us to continue to recruit, integrate and retain additional skilled and experienced sales personnel who can effectively communicate our value proposition to service providers. Accordingly, we could be adversely affected if we hire poorly or if sales personnel do not reach desired levels of effectiveness within a period of time consistent with our historical experience, thereby potentially harming our business, revenue or overall financial condition.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to increase our service provider revenue as we increase our market penetration and evolve our membership packaging, pricing and monetization strategies.\nHistorically, our service provider revenue per paid membership in a given market has generally increased concurrently with market penetration as we attracted more service providers, charged higher advertising rates and expanded our e-commerce initiatives in conjunction with the growth in the pool of consumers using our services. As we historically only increase advertising rates at the time of contract renewal, such rate increases in a given market may trail growth in market penetration. Moreover, trends in market penetration and growth in service provider revenue in our larger markets have varied from our experiences in our smaller markets, and the same can be said with respect to comparisons between our more and less penetrated markets. Accordingly, growth of our membership base or penetration of our markets may not result in service provider revenue increases until future periods, if at all. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with the credit quality of our service providers as our business could suffer if service providers to whom we provide advertising and e-commerce services are unable to meet their contractual obligations to us. Further, as our business evolves and membership packaging, pricing and monetization strategies change, any resulting declines in membership revenue may not be offset by concurrent increases in service provider revenue. Ultimately, if we are unable to increase our service provider revenue as our profitable growth plan evolves, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming, and such matters could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims and lawsuits and regularly involved in litigation, both as a plaintiff and as a defendant, related to our business and operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for litigation in the future. Any negative outcomes from litigation that we are party to could result in payment of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products, services or business practices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of litigation and claims brought against us cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of such matters that we currently face will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, except as otherwise recorded within the consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurance of a favorable final outcome for all present and future legal matters, and\nregardless of the outcomes of present or future cases, any lawsuit can adversely impact our business due to the potential related defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, potentially leading to payments of substantial damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe are and will continue to be faced with many competitive challenges, any of which could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe compete for consumers with traditional, offline consumer resources as well as with online providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, depth and timeliness of information, quality and availability of e-commerce offerings and strength and recognition of our brand. We also compete for a share of service providers\u2019 overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on investment, our membership profile, effectiveness and relevance of our discount and e-commerce initiatives, our pricing and monetization strategies and recognition of our brand. Our current competitors include a number of traditional offline consumer resources, such as the Yellow Pages and Consumers\u2019 CHECKBOOK. Many of these competitors also provide consumer reviews and information about service providers online. We also compete with \u201cfree to consumer\u201d online ratings websites and referral services, such as Amazon Home Services, Better Business Bureau, Google AdWords Express, Groupon, Inc., HomeAdvisor, Inc., Houzz, Inc., Porch.com, Inc., Pro.com, Red Beacon, Inc., TaskRabbit, Inc., Thumbtack, Inc., and Yelp, Inc. In our Health categories, we compete for members with other online resources for patients, such as RateMDs, Inc. and Health Grades, Inc. Across all categories, we also compete with established Internet companies, such as Amazon.com, Inc., eBay Inc., Facebook, Inc., Google, Inc., LivingSocial, Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo! Inc., who possess significantly greater resources and name recognition than we do.\nTo compete effectively across our membership and service provider platforms, we must continue to invest significant resources in marketing and in the development of technology that can enable our products and services to enhance our value proposition to consumers and sustain our investments in our sales force, the development of existing and new advertising products and e-commerce offerings, the acquisition of new memberships and the collection of reviews of service providers. Failure to compete effectively against our current or future competitors could result in losses of current or potential participating service providers or a reduced share of our participating service providers\u2019 overall operating budgets, which could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our service provider revenue or prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. There is no guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively in the future against existing or new competitors, and the failure to do so could result in losses of existing or potential paid memberships, reduced service provider revenue, increased marketing or selling expenses or diminished brand strength, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth strategy, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur growth strategy has required, and will continue to require, us to utilize substantial financial, operational and technical resources, including placing significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Continued growth could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our members and service providers. As our operations continue to grow in size, scope and complexity, it will be important for us to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and we may determine it is necessary to open additional operational locations, such as call centers, to support our advertising and e-commerce sales efforts, which would require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as we implement our growth strategy, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur revenue and operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed herein, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our current paid memberships and build our membership base;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our participating service providers and convince them to increase their advertising spending and engagement in our e-commerce marketplace;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new service providers to advertise and engage in our e-commerce marketplace;\n\u2022\nour ability to drive transaction volume in our marketplace;\n\u2022\nour revenue mix and any changes we make to our membership tiers and fee structure, e-commerce take rates or other sources of revenue;\n\u2022\nour marketing costs or selling expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe effects of increased competition in our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop new products and services;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending any litigation or enforcing our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting our business.\nSeasonal variations in the behavior of our members and service providers also may cause fluctuations in our financial results. For example, we expect to continue to experience some seasonal trends in member and service provider behavior due to decreased demand for home improvement services in winter months. In addition, advertising expenditures by service providers tend to be discretionary in nature and may be sporadic as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonality, many of which are outside our control. We also expect revenue contributions from our e-commerce offerings to fluctuate from period to period as the offerings evolve and due to seasonality. While we believe seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly financial results, our growth trajectory may overshadow these effects from time to time. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to seasonality in the future, which may result in fluctuations in our financial results from period to period.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success depends in part upon the continued service of key members of our management team as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, technology and other personnel. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Durchslag, and our co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie Hicks, are critical to our overall management as well as the development of our culture and strategic direction. In particular, the reputation, popularity and talent of Ms. Hicks is an important factor in public perceptions of Angie\u2019s List, and the loss of her services or any repeated or sustained shifts in public perceptions of her could adversely affect our business.\nFurther, Mr. Durchslag joined our company in September 2015. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of the company\u2019s operations and may result in cultural differences and friction due to changes in strategy and style. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees, creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, qualified individuals are in high demand in the Internet sector, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining them. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel possess more resources than us. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the technology sector, job candidates often consider the value of the stock compensation they would receive in connection with their employment. If we are unable to attract and retain our executive officers and key employees, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business could be harmed.\nWe provide our executive officers and other key personnel with a mix of cash and equity compensation. With respect to equity compensation, prior to 2015, we only offered stock options to these parties, but during 2015, we began granting time-based and performance-based restricted stock units to these parties as well. If equity awards granted to executive officers and other key personnel lose value or, in the case of stock options, are not in the money subsequent to the grant date, the viability of such equity awards as a retention tool could be negatively impacted, which may make it difficult to retain these employees. If we are unable to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to operate or expand our business as certain of our strategic initiatives may necessitate substantial capital resources before they begin to generate revenue. Additional funds may not be available when needed, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. For example, our debt facility contains various restrictive covenants with respect to the use of funds from our borrowings, and any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital. If we attempt to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, which could adversely affect the availability of such funds. Furthermore, volatility in the credit or equity markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, or the cost of such financing may not be favorable. If sufficient funds are not available to enhance our solutions, maintain the competitiveness of our technology or pursue business opportunities, we may not be able to adequately service our existing members, acquire new members or attract or retain participating service providers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs we recognize membership revenue over the term of the membership and recognize service provider revenue ratably over the relevant contract period, downturns or upturns in paid memberships or in service provider advertising may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe currently recognize membership revenue ratably over the term of a paid subscription and service provider revenue ratably over the time period during which the advertisements are run. As approximately 97% of our members subscribed on an annual or multi-year basis as of December 31, 2015, a large portion of our membership revenue reflects deferred revenue from memberships purchased in previous periods. Similarly, as our service provider contracts run for an average term of approximately one year, a large portion of our service provider revenue each period reflects purchasing decisions made in prior periods. Therefore, an increase or decrease in new or renewed paid memberships or new or renewed service provider contracts in any one period will not necessarily be fully reflected in our revenue for that period but will affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the impact of significant downturns or upturns in paid memberships or advertising sales may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nIf we fail to generate or maintain high-quality reviews and reports from our consumers, we may be unable to provide members with the information they seek, which could negatively impact membership and service provider retention and growth.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to provide our members with the information they seek, which is directly impacted by the quality and quantity of reviews and reports provided by our consumers. For example, we may be unable to offer our members adequate information on service providers if content is not contributed that is helpful or relevant to a service category in a particular market. We may be unable to provide members with the information they seek if consumers are unwilling to contribute reviews and reports due to concerns related to potential lawsuits or harassment by service providers they review, instances of which have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future. In addition, we may not be able to provide members with the information they seek if the information on our site is not updated. We do not remove older reviews, and members may view these reviews as less relevant, helpful or reliable. If our site does not provide current information about service providers or members perceive reviews on our site as less relevant or stale, our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nMembership growth is impacted by traffic to our website from search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, some of which offer products and services that compete directly with our products and services. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our site could decline, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our website traffic is generated by non-paid search results that appear on search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. While SEO has a much lower cost per acquisition as compared to many outbound marketing channels and helps reduce our overall cost per membership acquisition, our ability to maintain high organic search rankings is not within our control. As such, our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Separately, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in such a way that could adversely affect our search result rankings. For example, Google makes changes to its algorithms from time to time, any one of which could potentially impact our rankings, which we are dependent upon to a certain extent to drive traffic and ultimately sales to our site. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of Internet users directed to our website through search engines could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf service providers rated on our website do not meet the expectations of our members, or engage in unethical or illegal conduct, we may suffer reputational harm, liability or adverse impacts on our profitability and liquidity as a result.\nQuality and integrity are important foundations of our business that could be harmed by actions taken by service providers outside our control. Given that our members utilize our platforms and tools to gather information about services that oftentimes carry a high risk of failure and also at times to purchase services at discounted rates through our e-commerce offerings, if such services are performed incompetently or if service providers fail to perform prepaid services, our reputation could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that service providers will perform to the satisfaction of our members or at all. In addition, unethical or illegal conduct by service providers rated on our website could damage our reputation or expose us to liability arising from claims made by or on behalf of those harmed by such conduct.\nWe pay service providers for e-commerce offerings purchased by members in advance of the service performed. Under this payment model, service providers are paid regardless of whether the e-commerce offers are redeemed or the services are performed. Subject to certain limitations, we offer guarantees around price and service quality on work performed by service providers under e-commerce transactions executed on our platforms, and, also subject to certain limitations, our members may request a refund from us on these e-commerce transactions. As we do not control the service providers or the quality and price of the services they deliver, we develop estimates for refund claims. Our actual level of refund claims could prove to be greater than the level of refund claims we estimate, particularly as our revenue from e-commerce offerings grows and we develop additional e-commerce products, services and features. Moreover, our members may make requests for refunds with respect to which we are unable to recover reimbursement from our service providers, particularly as we alter our service provider monetization strategies. An increase in our refund rates, or our inability to recover from our service providers, could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nMany consumers utilize mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to access information about service providers and to search for and purchase e-commerce offers. If we are not successful in developing products through the use of these technologies, or our products are not widely adopted, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of consumers who seek information about service providers through mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, has increased significantly over the past several years and is likely to continue to grow in the future. If our members are unable to access our ratings and reviews of service providers on their mobile devices, if we otherwise fail to develop and maintain effective mobile advertising and e-commerce products and services or if our mobile products and services are not widely adopted by consumers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer. Additionally, as new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to forecast the challenges that may arise, and we may need to devote significant resources to the development, support and maintenance of these products. Finally, if we experience problems with continued integration of our mobile applications into mobile devices, if we experience issues with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as Apple, Inc.'s App Store or Google Play, or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile applications, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could result in liability to us, damage our reputation or harm our business.\nA variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information. We collect and utilize demographic and other information from and about consumers as they interact with our various platforms. We may also collect information from consumers when they provide ratings and reviews of service providers, purchase e-commerce offers, participate in polls or contests or sign up to receive emails from us. Further, we utilize tracking technologies,\nincluding \u201ccookies,\u201d to help us manage and track consumers' interactions with our platforms and deliver relevant advertising. Claims or allegations that we violated laws and regulations related to privacy and data security could in the future result in negative publicity or a loss of confidence in us by consumers and service providers and may subject us to government fines. In addition, we have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of consumer data on our websites and mobile applications. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices.\nIn the course of rating and reviewing health care or wellness providers, our consumers may post personal health information about themselves or others, and the health care or wellness providers reviewed by consumers may submit responses that contain private or confidential health information about those that provided the reviews or others. While we strive to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and regulations regarding personal health information, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose consumers or service providers, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols for personal information, including personal health information, imposed by law, regulation, self-regulatory bodies, industry standards and contractual obligations. However, such laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. Also, federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws or regulations regarding privacy matters. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could be enacted or its effect on our operations and business.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to accepting credit card and debit card payments.\nWe accept payments from service providers and consumers primarily through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our services, which could yield declines in memberships or service provider participation, or suffer an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we or any of our processing vendors experience problems with our billing software, or if the billing software malfunctions, it could adversely affect our member and service provider satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we are unable to automatically charge our members\u2019 or service providers' credit cards on a timely basis or at all, we could lose revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply. Our failure to comply fully with the PCI DSS may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such compliance failures may also subject us to fines, penalties, damages or civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders or credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures or significantly higher credit card costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, our credit card fees for chargeback transactions or our fees for many or all categories of credit and debit card transactions, credit card companies and debit card issuers may increase our fees or terminate their relationship with us. Any increases in our credit card or debit card fees could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise the rates for our services to offset the increase. Meanwhile, the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business and potentially negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs we develop and sell new products, services and features, we may be subject to additional and unexpected regulations, which could increase our costs or otherwise harm our business.\nAs we develop and sell products and services that address new segments of the market for local services and expand our marketplace initiatives, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations that could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. For example, our Angie\u2019s List Health offerings may become subject to additional federal and state health care laws and regulations, the application of which to specific products and services is unclear. Many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the online health and wellness information and advertising products and services that we provide; nevertheless, they may be applied to our products and services.\nWe generate e-commerce offerings that enable consumers to purchase services or products from our service providers. Transactions between consumers and service providers through our platforms in connection with these offerings may be subject to regulation, in whole or in part, by federal, state and local authorities.\nIn addition, the application of certain laws and regulations to some of our promotions are uncertain. These include laws and regulations such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, and unclaimed and abandoned property laws. If these promotions are subject to the CARD Act, unclaimed and abandoned property laws or any similar state law or regulation, we may be required to record liabilities with respect to unredeemed promotions, and we may be subject to additional fines and penalties.\nFrom time to time, we may also be notified of new laws and regulations, such as the Department of Labor\u2019s recently proposed revisions to the Fair Labor Standard Act, that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or any failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our revenue to decrease, our costs to increase or harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain, modify and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our website, mobile applications and related technologies and platforms.\nOur members access reviews and other information through our website, mobile applications and related technologies and platforms. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our consumers and service providers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our website and mobile applications and the underlying network infrastructure. As our membership and service provider bases as well as the number of visitors to and level of activity on our website and various related platforms grow, the amount of information shared across our technology infrastructure will continue to grow, and we will therefore require an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology platforms, including data centers, equipment and related network infrastructure as well as new technologies focused on driving enhanced customer experiences and business efficiencies, to support current and anticipated future growth and to effectively and efficiently handle the traffic and data flow on our website and systems. The development, expansion, operation and maintenance of our technology and network infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires significant internal and external resources. If we do not successfully develop, expand, operate or maintain our technology and network infrastructure, or if we experience operational failures, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose current and potential consumers and service providers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully prevent other companies from misappropriating our data in the future.\nFrom time to time, third parties attempt to misappropriate our ratings and reviews and other confidential data pertaining to our service providers, markets and sales procedures through website scraping, search robots, breach of confidentiality agreements or other means. We may not be able to successfully detect and prevent all such efforts in a timely manner or assure that no misuse of our data occurs. In addition, third parties operating \u201ccopycat\u201d websites have attempted to misappropriate data from our network and to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we identified such efforts by other companies, we employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. For example, during 2015, we filed a lawsuit against Amazon Local LLC and several of its employees alleging that they unlawfully accessed and misused our information. In other circumstances, we have enforced confidentiality duties with former employees via legal actions. However, we may not be able to detect all such efforts in a timely manner, or at all, and even if we could, the technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient to stop their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of companies operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the damage to our business caused by such websites. Regardless of whether or not we can successfully enforce our rights against third parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant time and resources as well as adversely impact our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions to safeguard our intellectual property. We do not have any patents or pending patent applications. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our digital content, aspects of our solutions for members and service providers, our technology, software, branding and functionality, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. Should we expand internationally in the future, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 22 registered trademarks in the United States, including \u201cAngie\u2019s List,\u201d two registered trademarks in Canada and one registered trademark in Europe, as well as five pending trademark applications in the United States. Some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive trademark protection. Trademark protection may also not be available, or sought by us, in every country in which our service may become available online. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours or purchase our trademarks and utilize confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing consumers and service providers. Moreover, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate marks similar to our trademarks. In addition, in the past, some service providers have used our trademarks inappropriately or without our permission, including our \u201cSuper Service Award,\u201d which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken and may in the future take action, including initiating litigation, to protect our intellectual property rights and the integrity of our brand, but these efforts may prove costly, ineffective or both.\nWe currently hold the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. Domain names generally are regulated by Internet governing bodies. If we lose the ability to use a domain name in the United States or any other country, we could be forced to incur significant additional expense to market our solutions, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials, which could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names that utilize the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d name in all of the countries in which we currently intend to conduct business. Further, our digital content is not protected by any registered copyrights or other registered intellectual property and is instead protected by statutory and common law rights and by user agreements that limit access to and use of our data and by technological measures. Compliance with use restrictions is difficult to monitor, and our proprietary rights in our digital content databases may be more difficult to enforce than other forms of intellectual property rights.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our personnel, consultants and third parties with whom we maintain relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors being able to obtain our trade secrets or independently develop similar or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInternet, technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. Some Internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, any of which could be utilized to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot guarantee that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights.\nAssertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court or are decided in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights, to cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions, to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content or materials and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. Litigation related to intellectual property rights, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive to resolve and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our services and technologies may utilize \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code of certain services subject to those licenses.\nSome of our services and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License. These open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the licenses be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, becomes subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.\nWe take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, nor incorporates, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. Additionally, we rely on multiple software programmers to design our proprietary technologies, and although we take steps to prevent our programmers from including open source software in the technologies and software code that they design, write and modify, we do not exercise complete control over the development efforts of our programmers, and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide software and related services necessary for the operation of our business.\nWe utilize third-party software in our product and service offerings and expect to continue to do so. The operation of our product and service offerings could be impaired if errors or defects occur in the third-party software we utilize, and it may be difficult for us to correct any such errors or defects as the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control, thereby potentially adversely affecting our business. Further, we cannot ensure that third-party licensors will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their software to maintain and enhance its capabilities or remain in business. Any impairment in our relationships with our third-party licensors could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, third-party in-licenses may expose us to increased risk, including risks associated with the assimilation of new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. The inability to obtain these licenses could result in delays in development of solutions until equivalent technology can be identified and integrated, which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to suffer.\nOur revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to pay sales tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax.\nWe currently only pay sales or other transaction taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do business. We do not separately collect sales or other transaction taxes. A successful assertion by any state, local jurisdiction or country in which we do not pay such taxes that we should be paying sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, or the imposition of new laws requiring the payment of sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales, create increased administrative burdens or costs, discourage consumers and service providers from purchasing products or services from us, decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may suffer liability as a result of the ratings or reviews posted on our website.\nOur terms of use specifically require consumers submitting reviews to represent that their ratings and reviews are based on their actual first-hand experiences and are accurate, truthful and complete in all respects and that they possess the right and authority to grant us a license to publish their reviews. However, we do not possess the ability to verify the accuracy of these representations on a case-by-case basis. There is a risk that a review may be considered defamatory or otherwise offensive, objectionable or illegal under applicable law. Therefore, there is a risk that publication of ratings and reviews on our website may give rise to a suit against us for defamation, civil rights infringement, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy, personal injury, product liability, breach of contract, unfair competition, discrimination, antitrust or other legal claims. From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits based on the contents of the ratings and reviews posted on our website, including claims of defamation. To date, we have not suffered a material loss due to a claim of defamation. We may be subject to similar claims in the future, which could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, liability for monetary damages or injury to our reputation, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize the expected business benefits of our efforts to reorganize our sales department, and the reorganized sales department could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or adversely affect our revenues and operating income.\nWe periodically make changes to the structure of our sales department in an effort to optimize performance and productivity. We recently completed a reorganization of our sales department, and we may determine it is necessary to make additional organizational changes again in the future. Such reorganizations involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the reorganization;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in and the cost of reorganizing operations, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset reorganization costs;\n\u2022\nliabilities and expenses associated with the reorganization, both known and unknown; and\n\u2022\nnegative impacts on our operating income and revenues due to the reduction in productivity and efficiency caused by the reorganization process.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate and execute internal reorganizations, our business may be seriously harmed, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face many risks associated with our long-term plan to expand our operations outside of the United States.\nExpanding our operations into international markets is an element of our long-term strategy. However, offering our products and services outside of the United States involves numerous risks and challenges. Most importantly, acquiring memberships in foreign countries and convincing foreign service providers to do business with us would require substantial investment by us in local advertising and marketing, and there can be no assurance that we would succeed or achieve any return on this investment. In addition, international expansion could expose us to other risks such as:\n\u2022\nthe need to modify our technology and sell our products and services in non-English speaking countries;\n\u2022\nthe need to localize our products and services to the preferences and customs of foreign consumers and service providers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance, staffing, cultural differences and business infrastructure constraints;\n\u2022\nour lack of experience in marketing, and encouraging viral marketing, in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe application of foreign laws and regulations to us, including more stringent consumer privacy and data protection laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe risk of member or service provider fraud;\n\u2022\nreduced or ineffective protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences associated with foreign operations and revenue.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to enter international markets, or entry into international markets could be delayed, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders or otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, consumer and service provider demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies rather than through internal development. Our experience with respect to acquiring other businesses and technologies is limited. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses for identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Furthermore, even if we successfully acquire additional businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business or technology. In addition, we may unknowingly inherit liabilities from future acquisitions that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely impact our operating results or the value of our common stock. If an acquired business or technology fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $137.6 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $176.4 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to utilize our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nConcentration of ownership among our officers and directors and their affiliates may limit the influence of new investors on corporate decisions.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliated funds beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, approximately 36% of our company's outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they would be capable of meaningfully influencing the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may delay or preclude an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different from the rest of our stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nThe actions of an activist stockholder could adversely affect our business. Specifically:\n\u2022\nresponding to common actions of an activist stockholder, such as public proposals and requests for special meetings, potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel as well as consumers and service providers;\n\u2022\npursuit of an activist stockholder\u2019s agenda may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nactions of an activist stockholder may cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to replace a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or (i) our board of directors approves the transaction prior to the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, the stockholder owns at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors or officers and shares owned by certain employee stock plans) or (iii) the transaction is approved by the board of directors and by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting by a vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares held or controlled by the interested stockholder). These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts or make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if the third-party's offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our financing agreement restricts our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate business operations purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, debt covenants, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.", "PERMNO": 13106, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ANGI.1"}
