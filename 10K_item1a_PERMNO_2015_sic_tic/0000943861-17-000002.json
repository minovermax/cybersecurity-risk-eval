{"cik": "943861", "company": "GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended concerning the Company\u2019s operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and natural gas properties, marketing and midstream activities, and also include those statements accompanied by or that otherwise include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d or similar expressions or variations on such expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made; the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risk and uncertainties:\n\u2022\nthe market prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the commodity-futures market;\n\u2022\nfinancial market conditions and availability of capital;\n\u2022\nfuture cash flows, credit availability and borrowings;\n\u2022\nsources of funding for exploration and development;\n\u2022\nour financial condition;\n\u2022\nour ability to repay our debt;\n\u2022\nthe securities, capital or credit markets;\n\u2022\nplanned capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nfuture drilling activity;\n\u2022\nuncertainties about the estimated quantities of our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nproduction;\n\u2022\nhedging arrangements;\n\u2022\nlitigation matters;\n\u2022\npursuit of potential future acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, either nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we are doing business;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes, including retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, hydraulic-fracturing regulation, drilling and permitting regulations, derivatives reform, changes in state and federal corporate taxes, environmental regulation, environmental risks and liability under federal, state and foreign and local environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our financial counterparties and operation partners; and\n\u2022\nother factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings, press releases and discussions with our management.\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of our Plan of Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting. Accordingly, our future financial conditions and results of operations may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. Our common stock is now listed on the over-the-counter market. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for the common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock. The common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company intends to join a national securities exchange. However, no assurances can be given regarding the Company\u2019s ability to do so in a timely manner or at all.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board changed significantly.\nPursuant to our Plan of Reorganization, the composition of the Board changed significantly. Upon emergence, the Board is now made up of seven directors, of which five have not previously served on the Board. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. There is no guarantee that the new Board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with the Majority Second Lien Noteholders (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) currently own a majority of our outstanding common stock. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d), the Majority Second Lien Noteholders have the continuing right to nominate three members of the Board, subject to conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Charter and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Charter and Bylaws include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOil prices and natural gas prices have declined substantially from historical highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile; a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas would adversely impact our business.\nOur success depends on the market prices of oil and natural gas. These market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control. The prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions. The general pace of global economic growth, the continued instability in the Middle East and other oil and natural gas producing regions and actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as other economic, political, and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices. Domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including U.S. economic conditions, weather patterns, other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels, the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply, and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry.\nNatural gas and crude oil prices are extremely volatile. High and low spot prices for New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) West Texas Intermediate crude oil and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas for were as follows:\nAverage oil and natural gas prices varied substantially during the past few years. Any actual or anticipated reduction in natural gas and crude oil prices may further depress the level of exploration, drilling and production activity. We expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future.\nChanges in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. These lower prices, coupled with the slow recovery in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital, have compelled most oil and natural gas producers, including us, to reduce the level of exploration, drilling and production activity. This will have a significant effect on our capital resources, liquidity and expected operating results. Any sustained reductions in oil and natural gas prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Additionally, further or continued declines in prices could result in additional non-cash charges to earnings due to impairment write-downs. Any such write down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nOur future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity.\nDrilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves. However, drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Exploration activities involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, the future cost and timing of drilling, completing and producing wells is often uncertain. Furthermore, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\ninadequate capital resources;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nlack of acceptable prospective acreage;\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nunavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment or labor;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with horizontal drilling.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often uncertain.\nIn addition, while lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, higher oil and natural gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of, and increased costs for, such drilling equipment, services and personnel. Such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned. Any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues.\nA sustained depression of oil and natural gas prices can continue to affect our ability to obtain funding on acceptable terms. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nWe cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nOur new common stock is listed on the OTCQX marketplace and is held by a small group of investors.\nThe lack of market and float of our stock can have an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our common stock and, as a result, the market price for our common stock could become more volatile. If we are unable to become re-listed on a national securities exchange and increase the market value per share of our common stock, it may be difficult to attract the interest of analysts, institutional investors, investment funds and brokers.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent a right to receive, common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities, including outstanding options, or otherwise will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report. These differences may be material.\nThe proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in this report are estimates. These estimates are based on reports prepared by NSAI and RSC, our independent reserve engineers, and were calculated using the unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices in 2016. The prices we receive for our production may be lower than those upon which our reserve estimates are based. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\nthe quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u2022\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas sales prices.\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material. The discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. As required by the SEC, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on 12-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in consumption; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, and which we use in calculating our PV-10, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, state, tribal, local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting and changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies or price gathering-rate controls. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, tribal and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including tax laws, and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits, including drilling permits, before conducting regulated activities; plugging and abandonment and site reclamation requirements; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limiting or prohibiting drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of civil and criminal fines and penalties, the revocation of permits or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our operations in certain areas. Moreover, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in legal requirements related to the protection of the environment could result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Such changes could also require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance, and also have the potential to reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as government reviews of such activity could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has taken the following actions and issued: guidance under the SDWA for hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel; final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of volatile organic compounds and methane emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in March 2014 under the Toxic Substances Control Act that would require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; and finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or\nproduced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The EPA has not proposed to take any action in response to the report\u2019s findings.\nCongress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Louisiana and Texas, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. There has also been increased public scrutiny of seismic events in areas where hydraulic fracturing of wastewater disposal activities occur. Moreover, some states and local governments have enacted laws or regulations limiting hydraulic fracturing within their borders or prohibiting the activity altogether. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nCertain scientific studies have found that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d are contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis, including greenhouse gas emissions from completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. These changes to EPA\u2019s GHG emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs. Also, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The BLM finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. . However, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have introduced resolutions seeking to repeal the BLM methane rules under the Congressional Review Act and future implementation of the BLM methane rules is uncertain. However, the BLM and the EPA methane rules have substantial similarities with respect to pollution control equipment and LDAR requirements. Compliance with rules to control methane emissions will likely require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nIn addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many states have established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce, which in turn could have the effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. Such climatic events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred losses from operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Predecessor Company incurred operating losses of $494.5 million and $354.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Post emergence from bankruptcy in 2016, the Successor company had an operating\nloss of $2.6 million. Our development of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures; therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flow.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations on us is uncertain.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such legislative changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Congress could consider, and could include, some or\nall of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income.\nWe have historically used hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases. We had no hedge settlements in 2016 and did not have any hedge contracts at December 31, 2016.\nWe account for our oil and natural gas derivatives using fair value accounting standards. Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value. Additionally, changes in a derivative\u2019s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swap and call derivative contracts and, as such, all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings. Our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception. Contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark-to-market accounting treatment.\nIn the future, we will continue to be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. See Note 10-\u201cDerivative Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. All of our crude oil hedging contracts expired in 2015. If we choose not to or are unable to replace our hedges, our cash flows from operations will be subjected to increased volatility.\nWe have historically entered into hedging transactions for our oil and natural gas production revenues to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas. All of our crude oil hedging contracts expired in 2015. As a result, more of our future production will be sold at market prices, exposing us to the fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas, unless we enter into additional hedging transactions. We may choose not to or be unable to replace our hedges, which will subject our cash flows from operations to increased volatility.\nBecause our operations require significant capital expenditures, we may not have the funds available to replace reserves, maintain production or maintain interests in our properties.\nWe must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities, proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales. Our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons. If our revenues or cash flows decrease, we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels. If this occurs, our production will decline over time. Other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. Where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and natural gas property, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property. If we cannot fund such capital expenditures, our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nIf we are unable to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production at present levels.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves will decline over time. At December 31, 2016, 85% of our total estimated proved reserves by volume were undeveloped. By their nature, estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain particularly because we may chose not to develop such reserves on anticipated schedules in future adverse oil or natural gas price environments. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves. We may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future. In addition, we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs.\nWe may incur substantial impairment writedowns.\nIf management\u2019s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment writedowns in the future, which would result in a negative impact to our financial position. Furthermore, any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments. Prior to emerging from bankruptcy we accounted for our Oil and Gas properties using the Successful Efforts Method of Accounting. We reviewed our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review. To determine if a depletable unit is impaired, we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management\u2019s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and natural gas reserves over the economic life of the property. Future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers\u2019 estimates of proved reserves. In addition, other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions. For each property determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis.\nFair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows. Any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset. Each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the depletable units\u2019 estimated reserves, future cash flows and fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment related to oil and natural gas properties of $452.0 million. The decline in oil and natural gas prices precipitated the loss of estimated proved reserves for our oil and natural gas producing properties. Additionally, the prospect of lower future prices raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and consequently all estimated proved undeveloped reserves were excluded from our estimated total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 and the carrying cost of the related undeveloped leasehold was impaired.\nUpon emerging from bankruptcy we implemented Fresh Start Reporting and changed to the Full Cost Method of accounting for our Oil and Natural Gas Properties. The Full Cost Method requires a ceiling test be performed each quarter to determine impairment. The reserve value basis used in the Ceiling Test is the SEC calculated reserves. The SEC value of reserves utilizes a look back at the last twelve month commodity prices. The Ceiling Test performed on December 31, 2016 resulted in an impairment of $2.5 million.\nA majority of our production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nEssentially all of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were associated with our Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi properties which include the Haynesville Shale and TMS Trend. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems, government intervention (including potential regulation or limitation of the use of high pressure fracture stimulation techniques in these formations) or natural disasters, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. For example, Chesapeake operates certain properties in the Haynesville Shale Trend. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of our reserves and approximately 40% of our sales volumes were attributable to non-operated properties. We have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with\nrespect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.\nOur ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.\nWe operate primarily in (i) Northwest Louisiana and East Texas, which includes the Haynesville Shale Trend and (ii) Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana which includes the TMS Trend. A number of companies are currently operating in the Haynesville Shale Trend. If drilling in these areas continues to be successful, the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Because of the current economic climate, certain pipeline projects that are planned for Northwest Louisiana and East Texas may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our natural gas to interstate pipelines. In such an event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or that we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, the interruption could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nThe acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well, facility or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or subsurface groundwater contamination, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing. We may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. The incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nDue to the nature of the industry, we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and, accordingly, amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant. The loss of, or material nonpayment or nonperformance by, any one or more of these customers could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to the nature of the industry, we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and, accordingly, amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant. Revenues from the largest of these sources as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 were 87%, and 74%, respectively. Some of our customers may have material financial and liquidity issues or may, as a result of operational incidents or other events, be disproportionately affected as compared to larger, better-capitalized companies. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nCustomer credit risks could result in losses.\nOur exposure to non-payment or non-performance by our customers and counterparties presents a credit risk. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customer\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s inability to satisfy obligations. We monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and established credit limits according to our credit policies and guidelines, but cannot assure that any losses will be consistent with our expectations. Furthermore, the concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by\nprolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. The revenues compared to our total oil and natural gas revenues from the top purchasers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors.\nWe compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers, geoscientists and other professional staff. We depend to a large extent on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team. If a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nThe oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves many uncertainties, economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nThe nature of the oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves certain operating hazards such as:\n\u2022\nwell blowouts;\n\u2022\ncratering;\n\u2022\nexplosions;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nshortages of, or delays in, obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards such as crude oil spills;\n\u2022\nnatural gas leaks;\n\u2022\npipeline and tank ruptures;\n\u2022\nunauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids or toxic gases into the environment;\n\u2022\nencountering naturally occurring radioactive materials;\n\u2022\nother pollution; and\n\u2022\nother hazards and risks.\nAny of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred. The payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions. These reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties. Additionally, some of our oil and natural gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes. Some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production.\nWe cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.\nWe maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:\n\u2022\npersonal injury;\n\u2022\nbodily injury;\n\u2022\nthird party property damage;\n\u2022\nmedical expenses;\n\u2022\nlegal defense costs;\n\u2022\npollution in some cases;\n\u2022\nwell blowouts in some cases; and\n\u2022\nworkers compensation.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future. A loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance or other covenants in the Exit Credit Facility, which could result in an event of default under the Exit Credit Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the Exit Credit Facility, the Company and the Subsidiary are required to maintain certain financial covenants including the maintenance of (i) a Total Proved Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.5 to 1.0 initially, and increasing to 2.0 to 1.0 or after December 31, 2018, (ii) Secured Debt Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) not to be less than 1.10 to 1.00 initially, and increasing to 1.35 to 1.00 and 1.50 to 1.00 after March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to be determined as of January 1 and July 1 each year and as of the date of any Material Acquisition (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) or Material Disposition (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement), (iii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, a ratio of Debt (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to EBITDAX for the twelve months ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter, not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00, (iv) limitations on Consolidated Cash Balance (as defined in the Exit Credit Agreement), (v) limitations on general and administrative expenses and (vi) minimum liquidity requirements.\nThe Exit Credit Facility also contains certain covenants which, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the Company\u2019s and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, prepay other indebtedness, sell, transfer, lease or dispose of assets, and make investments in or merge with another company.\nIf the Company were to violate any of the covenants under the Exit Credit Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period. If the Company were in default under the Exit Credit Facility, then the lenders thereunder may exercise remedies in accordance with the terms thereof, including declaring all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable. This could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nRestrictive covenants in our Exit Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Exit Credit Facility limits our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 incur additional liens;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022 make investments;\n\u2022 sell or discount of receivables;\n\u2022 enter into mergers;\n\u2022 sell properties;\n\u2022 terminate swap agreements;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 maintain gas imbalances;\n\u2022 enter into take-or-pay contracts or make other prepayments;\n\u2022 enter into swap agreements; and\n\u2022 make capital expenditures.\nThe Exit Credit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants as discussed above.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in a default under the in Exit Credit Facility. If a default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nAs of the date of filing this Annual Report, we have outstanding (i) costless warrants granted to the New 2L Notes Purchasers representing 2.5 million shares of our common stock, (ii) out-of-the-money 1.3 million warrants equal to an aggregate of up to 10% of the New Equity Interests with a maturity of 10 years and an equity strike price equal to $230.0 million and (iii) 1.9 million restricted stock awards. The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, and warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such options or the warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of the warrants and any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the warrants in the future.", "PERMNO": 57509, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GDP"}
